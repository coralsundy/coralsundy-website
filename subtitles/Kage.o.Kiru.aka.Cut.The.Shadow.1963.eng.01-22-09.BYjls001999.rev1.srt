00:00:21,355 --> 00:00:35,452
Kage o Kiru / Cut the Shadow (1963)

3
00:01:17,007 --> 00:01:23,437
This is Sendai's castle, known as Aoba Castle

4
00:01:24,842 --> 00:01:29,944
As the largest castle in Tohoku, it is very spacious

5
00:01:30,694 --> 00:01:35,741
The number of people working here is said to be over 35,000.

6
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,937
Of course, they are not always working

7
00:01:41,577 --> 00:01:44,187
But still, it is a considerable number.

8
00:01:48,444 --> 00:01:50,741
It's Itsutsuhan

9
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:54,218
It's 9 pm current time

10
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:14,866
This congestion seems to be due to the truth of the worker, which is the same now as it has always been

11
00:02:15,452 --> 00:02:18,772
What the hell you are?

12
00:02:25,648 --> 00:02:29,093
There're a lot of workers

13
00:02:30,187 --> 00:02:34,085
Beginning with a morning meeting

14
00:02:35,835 --> 00:02:39,546
Lord is coming

15
00:02:49,115 --> 00:02:53,514
He will give a singing

16
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:24,678
The young man inwardly doesn't seem to appreciate this morning meeting.

17
00:03:26,209 --> 00:03:31,490
They would be able to sleep that much better in the morning without it!

18
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,124
He will give a speech

19
00:03:57,139 --> 00:04:00,943
Young men these days are not good

20
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:06,764
They are flaccid.
They must respect our lord

21
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:11,535
I worked harder when I was young

22
00:04:12,432 --> 00:04:18,984
I think this is very hard for young people

23
00:04:26,571 --> 00:04:31,786
When you're working so hard, you can't even doze off.

24
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:33,426
But

25
00:04:36,024 --> 00:04:42,098
They are working here

26
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,864
Right now we are at peace and the only job we have is to inspect the weapons.

27
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:52,358
So they can doze off

28
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:56,088
Don't sleep!

29
00:04:59,077 --> 00:05:01,860
Do you work as a boatman?

30
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:05,317
Me? I don't

31
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,514
Your rowing was superb.

32
00:05:11,036 --> 00:05:14,649
You're stupid!
It's just joking.

33
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,491
You are no use

34
00:05:22,019 --> 00:05:24,226
Where's he?

35
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:27,849
He's at home

36
00:05:27,957 --> 00:05:29,822
I know

37
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:34,138
He's looking around house

38
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,976
Oh he's working

39
00:05:38,308 --> 00:05:42,459
I admire him very much

40
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,841
I’m going to see him at work

41
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,560
Hold on

42
00:05:48,728 --> 00:05:50,017
You shouldn't go

43
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:52,605
Don't worry

44
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,039
I will guide you

45
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:06,384
I want to see him working hard

46
00:06:06,428 --> 00:06:08,864
I am very grateful to him

47
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:15,457
I am disappointed that his son has become so bad

48
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:21,824
So I want to see him working hard

49
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,673
Hold on

50
00:06:31,074 --> 00:06:36,152
I will bring him here

51
00:06:36,308 --> 00:06:39,609
I'm still young enough to climb stairs

52
00:06:39,755 --> 00:06:43,251
I will bring him here

53
00:06:45,107 --> 00:06:47,548
you had better wait here for him to come

54
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,120
Get out of my way

55
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:56,093
I want to see him working hard

56
00:06:58,613 --> 00:06:59,492
Hold on

57
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,511
You stupid!

58
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:10,419
don't raise your voice.
I'm sleeping

59
00:07:10,444 --> 00:07:12,734
Jodai is here?

60
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:18,993
Are you kidding?

61
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,417
Excuse me

62
00:07:29,589 --> 00:07:33,212
Why you are not working?

63
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:36,445
I'm frustrated

64
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,425
is your job to sleep?

65
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:44,941
I was really sorry

66
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:52,314
The castle tower protects from foreign enemies

67
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:58,710
In short, it will be the last stronghold of the castle.

68
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:00,136
That's right

69
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:05,478
If a foreign enemy enters the castle, we will shut ourselves up there.

70
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:11,708
There we will wait for reinforcements and defeat the enemy.

71
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:17,548
In that case, the top floor of the castle will be LORD's home.

72
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:24,120
Even if the battle is fierce outside, he must rest here.

73
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:31,171
I was trying to see if he could sleep well here.

74
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:40,643
You may have been loud, but I didn't mind, and I slept peacefully.

75
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:46,669
I think that your snoring was so loud that people outside were surprised.

76
00:08:47,255 --> 00:08:51,249
The tower of Aoba Castle is wonderful!

77
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,114
Thank you very much

78
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:54,374
I can't talk with you

79
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,816
So please leave

80
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:03,837


81
00:09:05,771 --> 00:09:09,423
I heard you're always flirting with women

82
00:09:10,292 --> 00:09:12,997
I have to explain

83
00:09:15,068 --> 00:09:19,482
If I am popular with women, is it my sin?

84
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:27,372
It's up to women.
It's none of my business

85
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:32,597
You're stupid.
I hope you have a stable family

86
00:09:33,026 --> 00:09:36,493
do you want me to marry someone?

87
00:09:37,695 --> 00:09:39,618
I can't

88
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:43,384
No one wanna marry you?

89
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,454
No no. opposite

90
00:09:46,939 --> 00:09:54,087
no woman is worthy of me

91
00:09:56,449 --> 00:10:03,402
I heard that your daughter is very popular.

92
00:10:04,144 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah, kind of

93
00:10:07,923 --> 00:10:13,285
if so she can be my wife

94
00:10:13,597 --> 00:10:15,003
Your wife?

95
00:10:15,794 --> 00:10:18,470
Please think about it

96
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,660
You're stupid.
I don't wanna have my daughter marry to such a man

97
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,829
Are you alright?

98
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:34,769
I'm alright

99
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,038
It was close

100
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,866
It was okay because you hid early

101
00:10:47,607 --> 00:10:49,404
It was not ok

102
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:55,283
he was talking about that girl

103
00:10:58,105 --> 00:10:59,121
Look at that

104
00:11:00,361 --> 00:11:02,802
That's Lord's palace roof

105
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:04,541
How about that?

106
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,398
That's Lord's wife palace

107
00:11:09,072 --> 00:11:11,308
There is only one palace in a castle

108
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:14,219
Here has two

109
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:16,074
But

110
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:24,375
Originally there was one, but later there were two Palace

111
00:11:25,683 --> 00:11:34,023
It doesn't matter if it's big or small

112
00:11:34,814 --> 00:11:40,185
So They built one of the same size but it's not the same

113
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:46,279
Over there is much more luxurious than here

114
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:51,162
I'm called a lord, but she's called GOZEN-sama

115
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,955
What do you wanna say?

116
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,904
you shouldn't have a better wife than you

117
00:11:58,164 --> 00:12:00,810
You'd better take a commoner's daughter as your wife

118
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,615
Don't worry about that

119
00:12:06,211 --> 00:12:09,267
we are not your case

120
00:12:09,736 --> 00:12:12,519
KUBOU's daughter and JODAI's daughter are different

121
00:12:12,544 --> 00:12:17,392
There is not much difference between a general's daughter and a commoner's daughter

122
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:34,220
It's too noisy

123
00:12:40,377 --> 00:12:42,096
Hey

124
00:12:49,127 --> 00:12:56,432
It's boring to be in this crowd, so why don't we go out for a drink?

125
00:13:07,057 --> 00:13:13,180
You intend to marry JODAI's daughter.

126
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,823
No way

127
00:13:17,643 --> 00:13:19,743
It's not true?

128
00:13:21,686 --> 00:13:23,395
You are annoying

129
00:13:23,522 --> 00:13:25,319
there was such a story

130
00:13:25,739 --> 00:13:29,733
I said I can think

131
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:32,233
Everyone talk about it

132
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:37,741
Oh I see.
I'm popular

133
00:13:39,264 --> 00:13:41,159
Anyway, everyone had a good laugh.

134
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,008
Everyone had a good laugh?

135
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:46,032
they said there was a big difference

136
00:13:47,477 --> 00:13:51,676
I thought she was a very modest woman

137
00:13:52,106 --> 00:13:55,846
she doesn't have a pretty face

138
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:03,815
You are the worst.
She's so beautiful

139
00:14:04,098 --> 00:14:04,957
Have you seen her?

140
00:14:05,368 --> 00:14:07,037
Not

141
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:10,065
She must be beautiful

142
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,291
I never trust gossip.

143
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:17,243
Rumor has it I'm a playboy.

144
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:20,280
I'm a playboy?

145
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:23,405
No.
You are a pure boy

146
00:14:25,016 --> 00:14:27,311
I never trust gossip.

147
00:14:47,575 --> 00:14:49,957
I'm back

148
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,712
Please come to Dojo

149
00:14:58,024 --> 00:14:58,923
Dojo?

150
00:15:00,026 --> 00:15:01,794
Someone wanna battle with you

151
00:15:02,077 --> 00:15:02,946
Again

152
00:15:03,513 --> 00:15:06,139
A man who wants money to drink

153
00:15:06,296 --> 00:15:07,272
It could be

154
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:10,495
I'm tried. Give him money

155
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,694
Samurai must fight according to the rules

156
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:18,630
I have to fight against such poor people

157
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:36,237
How much you want?

158
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:37,311
1 ryo

159
00:15:37,585 --> 00:15:38,884
Ok I will  hit your arm

160
00:15:43,495 --> 00:15:44,491
Give up?

161
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:58,558
Ok I will bring it to him

162
00:16:09,156 --> 00:16:12,437
Can you lend me 1 ryo?

163
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:17,388
I can't.
You pay 1 RYO every match

164
00:16:17,413 --> 00:16:22,212
I know but I have no money now

165
00:16:23,911 --> 00:16:33,033
Your father's subordinates had more than 30 people

166
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:40,494
But now, your subordinate is only me

167
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:43,712
I appropriate you

168
00:16:44,152 --> 00:16:50,773
I just want you to return the money I gave you

169
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:56,720
You know how much?
you haven't paid me a bonus for four years

170
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,943
Cash rebuilding is 58

171
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:02,169
30% interests

172
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:04,083
That's just small money

173
00:17:04,639 --> 00:17:08,301
I have a lot of assets

174
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:24,855
Thank you for coming to work early today.

175
00:17:25,646 --> 00:17:32,384
In this way, I changed my appearance.
I love to play at night

176
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,037
It seems that tonight is the last night

177
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,169
Why?

178
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:38,937
You were found?

179
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:41,251
Gozen will come back suddenly

180
00:17:41,652 --> 00:17:42,443
Really

181
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:47,316
When she comes back. I'll lose all my freedom of movement

182
00:17:55,317 --> 00:17:56,762
Please wait a moment

183
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,184
I need money.
Lend me 2 ryo

184
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:09,938
2 ryo?
I can't

185
00:18:09,977 --> 00:18:11,315
I'll give it back

186
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:15,768
You should ask the Lord

187
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:20,992
He has no money

188
00:18:21,569 --> 00:18:27,281
Jodai control his money

189
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:38,457
I have talk of marrying a rich woman

190
00:18:38,623 --> 00:18:40,752
Marry?

191
00:18:41,562 --> 00:18:43,271
You're kidding

192
00:18:43,296 --> 00:18:44,873
Gojodai's daughter

193
00:18:45,234 --> 00:18:47,773
That Sendai girl?

194
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,812
That is an unprecedented occurrence, isn't it?

195
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:58,251
Naonto is here?

196
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,654
Gojodai

197
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:04,541
Thanks

198
00:19:05,869 --> 00:19:09,306
I'll give it to you in celebration

199
00:19:09,394 --> 00:19:10,283
Thanks

200
00:19:11,787 --> 00:19:14,492
No one here?

201
00:19:15,517 --> 00:19:17,578
Thanks for coming

202
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:20,790
What a messy room

203
00:19:21,103 --> 00:19:27,392
Not a single piece of furniture that was there before is missing.

204
00:19:27,597 --> 00:19:30,127
that is very precious

205
00:19:30,195 --> 00:19:31,787
I sold it

206
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:34,683
You are stupid

207
00:19:34,771 --> 00:19:37,545
I sold it to pawn shop

208
00:19:38,814 --> 00:19:41,197
The interest is 7%

209
00:19:41,489 --> 00:19:44,390
How about the picture?

210
00:19:44,722 --> 00:19:47,584
it was exchanged for eggs and rice

211
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,627
Lord

212
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,049
What's wrong?

213
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,695
I will go to play to Yagurashita

214
00:19:57,262 --> 00:20:00,415
Yagurashita?

215
00:20:12,317 --> 00:20:13,403
Enjoy

216
00:20:13,428 --> 00:20:14,082
I don't

217
00:20:14,128 --> 00:20:15,902
You don't drink?

218
00:20:15,927 --> 00:20:17,012
Take it easy

219
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,785
Shut up

220
00:20:20,934 --> 00:20:23,887
You look good

221
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:28,910
I couldn't bear to see you

222
00:20:29,365 --> 00:20:31,060
I haven't paid in a long time?

223
00:20:31,209 --> 00:20:35,779
I will pay the money

224
00:20:35,804 --> 00:20:40,787
I'll support you.
Please bring him to here every night

225
00:20:41,334 --> 00:20:42,326
Chu-san

226
00:20:42,646 --> 00:20:43,576
Chu-san?

227
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:49,342
is a nickname for my name

228
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,130
Can you look at my palm?

229
00:20:57,138 --> 00:20:58,818
Dirty!?

230
00:20:59,513 --> 00:21:02,693
I can easily hold a woman's hand by doing this.

231
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,240
I was leant this

232
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:07,373
Dirty!

233
00:21:07,717 --> 00:21:09,021
Hey old man

234
00:21:09,209 --> 00:21:09,958
old man?

235
00:21:09,998 --> 00:21:13,420
You are not young.
What do you mean by dirty?

236
00:21:13,545 --> 00:21:15,662
He's good at joking

237
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:25,193
Since I was very poor when I was little, he wants me to be happy.

238
00:21:26,357 --> 00:21:28,482
I'm glad, if it makes me feel better.

239
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,865
He's a really sweet guy.

240
00:21:32,396 --> 00:21:35,592
but he has no money like me

241
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:40,045
But I really love you

242
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,888
When Gojodai come?

243
00:21:44,412 --> 00:21:46,646
Well.....

244
00:21:47,201 --> 00:21:52,021
what are you hiding?
She comes home earlier than I thought

245
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,107
maybe she'll come home tonight

246
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:07,170
I know but I can't stop

247
00:22:08,998 --> 00:22:12,795
Let's have fun,
Here's good place

248
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:20,951
After work, alcohol is very delicious

249
00:22:22,513 --> 00:22:25,303
Are you afraid of your wife?

250
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,115
Stop saying it

251
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:38,193
Don't call me old man but Sho-san

252
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:40,240
Chu-san

253
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,255
I'm sorry

254
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:12,113
she comes home without contacting me

255
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:15,652
Lord has come home quickly

256
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,886
Where's Gojodai?

257
00:23:18,597 --> 00:23:21,316
He's still drinking

258
00:23:21,628 --> 00:23:23,339
Come!

259
00:23:29,777 --> 00:23:31,722
What have you been doing?

260
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:34,363
I'm sorry to have to excuse you. I have an urgent matter to attend to.

261
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:40,035
That's not what I meant.
I came here because I have something to do with you.

262
00:23:40,456 --> 00:23:44,285
I came to say something I forgot

263
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:51,886
my daughter wants to marry you

264
00:23:54,427 --> 00:24:00,419
but I know what kind of man you are

265
00:24:01,558 --> 00:24:05,972
I will tell her that you play with women every night

266
00:24:06,956 --> 00:24:14,761
she may be very surprised.
But I think it's better than marrying you

267
00:24:15,449 --> 00:24:19,043
you should hit your head and die

268
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:30,122
I want you to return the money I gave you

269
00:24:31,622 --> 00:24:32,833
She choked.?

270
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,701
No, she was just trying

271
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:37,763
Not Naondo but Gojodai's daughter

272
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,591
No no

273
00:24:41,904 --> 00:24:47,935
GOJODAI made a joke about him in front of his family

274
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,427
She told me to marry me

275
00:24:51,349 --> 00:24:53,552
She doesn't know how you are

276
00:24:53,577 --> 00:24:55,724
We should tell Gojodai how you are

277
00:24:56,833 --> 00:25:01,865
So Asked Gojodai to go to Yakurashita

278
00:25:02,493 --> 00:25:07,493
then see how he was playboy

279
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:11,907
He refused to have her to marry him

280
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:21,469
but she didn't change her mind to get married

281
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:28,274
She said she would hang herself without permission

282
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:33,743
damn it. what the hell about the play boy

283
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,329
You are just play boy

284
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:44,212
Who told I"m pure boy last day?

285
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:45,983
I didn't have good eye

286
00:25:46,203 --> 00:25:52,507
You came here to marry Kiyoshiro-san's daughter, didn't you?

287
00:25:52,711 --> 00:25:55,461
I didn't mean that

288
00:25:56,093 --> 00:25:59,734
I just happen to come here

289
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:05,468
Sorry I have a guest

290
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:09,015
Please stay here

291
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:17,811
Please pay all the money that I paid

292
00:26:17,866 --> 00:26:20,476
That's supporting money for me

293
00:26:20,601 --> 00:26:26,147
I will make sure you pay

294
00:26:26,342 --> 00:26:27,053
Master

295
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,593
Sorry, please come here

296
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,569
I will make sure you pay

297
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:43,351
Hi

298
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:49,568
You tricked me and played with Komachi

299
00:26:49,796 --> 00:26:52,960
Did I? No way

300
00:26:53,163 --> 00:26:55,202
I heard you're going to marry Jodai's daughter.

301
00:26:55,772 --> 00:26:59,304
It could be

302
00:27:00,303 --> 00:27:04,670
but the story is not true

303
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:14,709
she is very beautiful.
She won't marry a man with no money like this

304
00:27:16,624 --> 00:27:19,038
But you are popular among women

305
00:27:19,632 --> 00:27:21,429
Thanks for saying so

306
00:27:24,085 --> 00:27:29,686
I consented to this marriage for money

307
00:27:30,717 --> 00:27:34,624
I hate that kind of woman

308
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:35,592
What do you mean?

309
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:38,655
She's totally ugly

310
00:27:43,397 --> 00:27:47,389
You have a guest from Date

311
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:50,288
Please come here

312
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:53,608
Please come here

313
00:27:54,991 --> 00:27:56,850
Go to see her

314
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:19,186
I'm dake's daughter.
Thanks for seeing me

315
00:28:20,358 --> 00:28:22,967
Thanks for coming

316
00:28:37,326 --> 00:28:42,162
Mr. Date's daughter, SADA, has arrived.

317
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,506
she didn't sneeze

318
00:29:18,754 --> 00:29:21,543
I'm Shogen's daughter,Sada.

319
00:29:36,158 --> 00:29:41,056
My father told me to come see this mansion being repaired.

320
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:51,009
I didn't want to come here, but I came to mind to come here for marriage.

321
00:29:51,642 --> 00:29:56,291
I wanted to preview this place for my wedding

322
00:29:57,392 --> 00:30:05,118
I appreciate your concern.
Here is too old

323
00:30:05,384 --> 00:30:11,353
It would be quicker to rebuild everything here, but please take a look at everything

324
00:30:11,619 --> 00:30:13,377
Thanks

325
00:30:13,509 --> 00:30:15,306
Please look at the room

326
00:30:24,916 --> 00:30:26,752
Here's reception room

327
00:30:34,837 --> 00:30:36,634
She did sneeze

328
00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:40,392
Here's guest room

329
00:30:41,821 --> 00:30:47,931
I'm Botan.
I am always indebted to your husband

330
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:53,837
Please take this.
Please come to see me later

331
00:30:55,978 --> 00:31:01,853
There are a lot of strange maids here

332
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,595
Please guide me

333
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:15,275
Here's living room

334
00:31:53,337 --> 00:31:53,978
Lord

335
00:32:09,618 --> 00:32:12,384
Is she Yagurashi's girl?

336
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,970
What are you talking about?

337
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,954
Shogen's daughter is getting married, so I was thinking of celebrating

338
00:32:46,218 --> 00:32:47,069
Excuse me

339
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:49,093
What's wrong?

340
00:32:49,257 --> 00:32:50,444
Lord is here

341
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:57,736
Lord and Jodai's daughter are here

342
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:12,104
Please keep going

343
00:33:14,705 --> 00:33:18,385
Why would you marry Mr. Shogen's daughter?

344
00:33:18,947 --> 00:33:20,854
She's nice,right?

345
00:33:21,315 --> 00:33:26,635
I'm sure you'll regret it later

346
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:43,976
I wish you happiness and happiness in the future

347
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,865
Excuse me

348
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,736
Don't be shy.
Come here

349
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,337
Please keep the promise

350
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:04,587
What?

351
00:35:06,236 --> 00:35:09,298
My father told you

352
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:14,368
We'll do something before sex

353
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:15,878
What the hell?

354
00:35:18,698 --> 00:35:20,784
Oh I know. You mean it?

355
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:26,729
Besides working as a lord, you also work in kendo.

356
00:35:28,737 --> 00:35:34,362
You are famous for your high kendo skills.

357
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:42,284
After this, please fight Sada in the dojo.

358
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:51,683
If you lose, please go to kendo training.

359
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:54,900
I don't have to go to the Dojo

360
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,177
We can fight here

361
00:36:32,121 --> 00:36:37,394
did he have a showdown with her?

362
00:36:37,488 --> 00:36:41,160
you should be more careful

363
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:47,996
I think it's a very good thing for Sarah to face off against him.

364
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:52,191
I want to see them face off

365
00:36:57,941 --> 00:36:59,543
Thanks in advance

366
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:06,316
I will do my best to fight you

367
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:34,949
Stop!

368
00:37:38,949 --> 00:37:40,519
Let me fight more

369
00:37:46,527 --> 00:37:48,082
Stop!

370
00:37:49,457 --> 00:37:51,137
It was nice fight

371
00:37:51,715 --> 00:37:54,980
Thanks for showing me

372
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:09,798
I told you she was strong

373
00:38:27,816 --> 00:38:37,050
If you feel frustrated, you should practice Kendo with all your might.

374
00:38:37,871 --> 00:38:41,480
I hope it's good for your life

375
00:38:56,774 --> 00:39:05,610
You were in Edo for half a year, but you were more interested in women than kendo.

376
00:39:06,899 --> 00:39:11,298
You can't beat that woman with that

377
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:14,977
Don't worry.
I'm better than her in terms of ability

378
00:39:15,548 --> 00:39:26,118
I met a lot of women in Edo, so I became very good at dealing with women.

379
00:39:26,766 --> 00:39:36,438
I'm not sure if your technique will work for your wife.

380
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,821
I'm sure it will work

381
00:39:42,798 --> 00:39:44,321
Does it hurt?

382
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,431
Take care

383
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:50,931
get ready for the bath

384
00:39:51,227 --> 00:39:56,133
I want to take a bath and then have a drink

385
00:39:56,158 --> 00:39:59,329
Please come Dojo

386
00:40:03,263 --> 00:40:08,490
you fool me too much!
I'll definitely beat you!

387
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:29,286
Last time I lost, but I also trained at EDO

388
00:40:29,708 --> 00:40:33,427
I got much better

389
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:35,755
Are you ready?

390
00:41:42,168 --> 00:41:46,301
I took revenge on you

391
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,808
After all, lying is bad

392
00:42:40,538 --> 00:42:41,920
Oh you are here

393
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:48,960
It's nice to have you here.
Don't worry about money.

394
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:51,608
Let's drink together

395
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:55,749
Orusui is calling you

396
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,671
I'll be pissed?

397
00:42:57,976 --> 00:43:04,920
You don't practice at the dojo, you just play around

398
00:43:05,421 --> 00:43:06,108
Let's go

399
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,093
OKOK, I'll be back soon

400
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,694
Oh my sword

401
00:43:15,202 --> 00:43:17,952
This is Samurai's must item

402
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:20,819
Oh I can't walk

403
00:43:21,155 --> 00:43:22,819
Call cab

404
00:43:23,288 --> 00:43:27,210
Hey,get ready and go

405
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,061
You stupid!

406
00:43:30,046 --> 00:43:31,163
I'm shame of you

407
00:43:31,491 --> 00:43:32,491
I'm sorry

408
00:43:33,515 --> 00:43:37,226
I'm not mad at you playing around

409
00:43:38,296 --> 00:43:40,702
because I’ve been doing the same

410
00:43:45,215 --> 00:43:47,653
Drink and play around

411
00:43:48,778 --> 00:43:53,489
But drink first-class liquor and hang out with first-class women

412
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:56,059
you play right

413
00:43:57,824 --> 00:44:00,614
So I've  called you

414
00:44:00,785 --> 00:44:04,207
I thought you would scold me

415
00:44:06,785 --> 00:44:09,489
Let's have fun

416
00:44:14,315 --> 00:44:17,831
I think you have a very different way of thinking.

417
00:44:17,979 --> 00:44:18,792
Don't flatter me

418
00:44:18,817 --> 00:44:22,315
I think you are more wonderful than Jodai

419
00:44:24,698 --> 00:44:25,784
Cut it out

420
00:44:25,956 --> 00:44:27,745
I really think so

421
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:29,557
Sorry I'm late

422
00:44:31,596 --> 00:44:33,370
Oh you come here

423
00:44:34,495 --> 00:44:36,159
Thanks for coming

424
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:41,315
She's Kimiryu

425
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,651
She's nice right?

426
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:44,667
you are so amazing to praise

427
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:47,635
Please drink

428
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:54,143
you stare at her too much

429
00:44:55,565 --> 00:44:59,034
my face is not beautiful

430
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:04,846
Please stare at me

431
00:45:05,291 --> 00:45:08,150
I was a little worried

432
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:09,971
What's that?

433
00:45:09,996 --> 00:45:12,057
Never mind.
Give me a sake

434
00:45:13,002 --> 00:45:16,822
I'm happy to meet you, so I'll give you SAKE three times.

435
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:21,252
He'll treat me tonight.
I can drink a lot

436
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:24,971
I'm glad.
Let's have fun

437
00:45:24,996 --> 00:45:28,510
it's not so good to be around him

438
00:45:29,775 --> 00:45:30,877
Why?

439
00:45:30,932 --> 00:45:33,666
he is famous for playboy

440
00:45:35,025 --> 00:45:36,768
I don't think so

441
00:45:37,283 --> 00:45:39,674
You are pure man

442
00:45:39,699 --> 00:45:41,908
Yes I am.
Sendai people call me so

443
00:45:41,933 --> 00:45:45,229
be careful with money and power

444
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:47,877
I'm not concerned about money

445
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:51,315
I want to support him

446
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,395
You mean it?

447
00:45:56,996 --> 00:45:58,442
I mean it

448
00:45:58,551 --> 00:46:00,137
Let's drink together

449
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:08,523
Good night

450
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:16,901
I'm home

451
00:46:25,013 --> 00:46:26,521
Welcome home

452
00:46:26,873 --> 00:46:28,599
Can I order?

453
00:46:29,138 --> 00:46:30,170
You can't

454
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:33,467
Can you buy sake for me?

455
00:46:42,641 --> 00:46:45,680
I heard she's your aunt

456
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:53,945
Your aunt is very kind and beautiful

457
00:46:56,982 --> 00:47:00,037
Ok I'll go to buy

458
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:10,627
Everyone was worried because you didn't come back while you were outside.

459
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:15,627
It's bad to drink alcohol with my parents

460
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:21,791
I heard a lot of rumors about you

461
00:47:22,314 --> 00:47:22,931
About me?

462
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,814
About your wife too

463
00:47:26,752 --> 00:47:28,009
Don't get jealous

464
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:33,447
You fall in love with me so I picked up you

465
00:47:33,939 --> 00:47:35,353
Do I fall in love with you?

466
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,400
How did you know?

467
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,142
All women like you fall in love with me

468
00:47:44,426 --> 00:47:47,020
What do you mean?

469
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:50,395
My wife looks like you

470
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:58,137
You were kicked out of the house after losing to your wife.

471
00:47:58,741 --> 00:48:00,390
Oh you know that

472
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:04,437
They told you everything

473
00:48:05,156 --> 00:48:08,531
they said you were such a bad man

474
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:15,179
Why don't you practice kendo instead of just playing around?

475
00:48:15,374 --> 00:48:17,468
I don't feel like doing it

476
00:48:17,796 --> 00:48:21,984
I heard you're a kendo master

477
00:48:22,343 --> 00:48:24,484
It's bad you lose to your wife

478
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,499
That monster wanted to fight, so I fought her reluctantly.

479
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,249
that monster?

480
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,304
My wife

481
00:48:33,906 --> 00:48:41,905
We are in an era of peace, so we don't need kendo skills.

482
00:48:42,468 --> 00:48:45,585
Japan has 260 clans

483
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:50,335
However, the top of them is not necessarily a kendo master.

484
00:48:50,452 --> 00:48:51,906
I think I'm not bad

485
00:48:54,225 --> 00:48:59,405
But she has appeared.
She's not honest

486
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:03,843
If she's in love with me, my physical appearance is irrelevant.

487
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:07,296
That's the difference from you

488
00:49:07,538 --> 00:49:19,725
She was too proud to find a reason to marry someone like me who had no money.

489
00:49:20,468 --> 00:49:27,436
She's trying to make me a respectable man.

490
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:32,671
She is delusional.

491
00:49:33,038 --> 00:49:38,944
It means beautiful story

492
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:40,725
Give me a break

493
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:47,991
I won't let her do what she plans.

494
00:50:01,588 --> 00:50:12,197
Gojodai,Shogei Date.
He's here to give you gifts

495
00:50:12,635 --> 00:50:14,369
What? He's not here?

496
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,057
He knows Gojodai comes today

497
00:50:20,854 --> 00:50:23,486
Bring him from Dojo

498
00:50:24,432 --> 00:50:25,869
Well..but...

499
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:31,432
The Geisha you called has not come.
Don't be disappointed

500
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:35,276
She didn't come last night too

501
00:50:35,354 --> 00:50:37,143
Toda is the same

502
00:50:37,494 --> 00:50:39,361
Toda?
That Takegaki's?

503
00:50:39,643 --> 00:50:43,127
He comes every night, and He finally took her out

504
00:50:43,658 --> 00:50:46,384
 He finally took her out?
To where?

505
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:50,518
He's good at teasing women

506
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:53,627
Look at that

507
00:50:58,579 --> 00:50:59,711
Damn it

508
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:04,930
What's wrong?
What are you going to do?

509
00:51:05,704 --> 00:51:07,243
You're stupid

510
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,415
Gojodai

511
00:51:09,688 --> 00:51:12,422
Yes I am here

512
00:51:13,493 --> 00:51:15,352
Why you come here?

513
00:51:19,266 --> 00:51:22,461
You told him,right?

514
00:51:22,486 --> 00:51:25,571
I asked him to bring me here

515
00:51:28,555 --> 00:51:37,305
You know what? I am away from my wife.
I want to have fun in Edo too

516
00:51:48,399 --> 00:51:49,414
Gojodai is here

517
00:51:49,547 --> 00:51:50,829
Gojodai is here?

518
00:51:52,171 --> 00:51:53,320
Oh my god

519
00:51:53,345 --> 00:51:54,024
Why?

520
00:51:55,094 --> 00:51:56,618
I have to go

521
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:58,938
Excuse me

522
00:51:59,297 --> 00:52:00,805
I really hate that old man

523
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:10,227
That's funny

524
00:52:12,813 --> 00:52:16,711
What's wrong, Naondo?

525
00:52:17,313 --> 00:52:20,946
I don't feel like playing with My dad

526
00:52:22,094 --> 00:52:26,125
Don't call me Dad but Bros in front of girls

527
00:52:26,454 --> 00:52:27,172
Bros?

528
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:29,430
Good evening

529
00:52:29,455 --> 00:52:33,047
Edo girls are here

530
00:52:36,032 --> 00:52:38,375
You look so nice

531
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:39,485
I'm shy

532
00:52:40,704 --> 00:52:44,266
I'm Sho, nice to meet you

533
00:52:44,672 --> 00:52:46,188
nice to meet you

534
00:52:48,063 --> 00:52:49,329
Please

535
00:52:53,313 --> 00:52:54,219
Dad

536
00:52:54,547 --> 00:52:55,352
Call me Bros

537
00:52:56,774 --> 00:52:59,789
Does she look like someone?

538
00:53:00,118 --> 00:53:01,000
Who?

539
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,539
Sada

540
00:53:03,899 --> 00:53:07,993
No way.
Woman like her shouldn't be here

541
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:15,508
Oh,If I look closely,I can see a little bit of her.
But she's much better

542
00:53:16,754 --> 00:53:22,613
Are you people trying to bully me?

543
00:53:25,418 --> 00:53:30,441
Oh you look unhappy

544
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:34,394
What's wrong.
Let's have fun

545
00:53:34,871 --> 00:53:39,019
I'm very afraid.
I can't have fun with you

546
00:53:40,324 --> 00:53:44,785
This is our work.
Don't be modest

547
00:53:44,933 --> 00:53:46,980
Thank you

548
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:54,546
Someone wanna dance with me?

549
00:53:55,866 --> 00:53:58,038
I will

550
00:53:58,063 --> 00:53:59,639
I like you

551
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:00,803
What dance?

552
00:54:01,053 --> 00:54:04,069
Anything happy

553
00:54:04,928 --> 00:54:06,600
You wanna dance too?

554
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:07,756
No way

555
00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:10,124
Are you running away?

556
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:13,921
Let's have fun!

557
00:54:18,741 --> 00:54:20,593
Where are you bringing me?

558
00:54:23,288 --> 00:54:25,350
What's wrong?

559
00:54:27,382 --> 00:54:32,389
I feel that Sada is here

560
00:54:32,483 --> 00:54:33,428
No way

561
00:54:33,453 --> 00:54:37,655
Why did you refuse to have a sake from the Geisha?

562
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:40,475
I'm too shy at beautiful woman

563
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:45,889
It's weird, Gojodai and Kimiryu are first meeting but they look too friendly

564
00:54:46,827 --> 00:54:50,311
I'm his son so I know how he plans

565
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:56,296
I'm going to Sendai

566
00:54:56,975 --> 00:54:58,389
Sendai? for what?

567
00:54:59,303 --> 00:55:02,913
I'll check if Sada is in Sendai or not

568
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:37,822
Play

569
00:55:39,728 --> 00:55:40,463
Practice

570
00:55:45,744 --> 00:55:46,697
Again

571
00:55:53,676 --> 00:55:56,340
Take your arm back little bit

572
00:56:20,095 --> 00:56:21,861
How was it?

573
00:56:22,017 --> 00:56:22,978
She's there

574
00:56:23,525 --> 00:56:25,087
Is that so?

575
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:29,306
I'll see Kimiryu soon

576
00:56:35,454 --> 00:56:41,633
Kimiryu is absent these days but I'll try to call her tonight

577
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,750
I found out.
I can't believe why you made this

578
00:56:53,579 --> 00:56:54,946
I'm so frustrated

579
00:57:05,128 --> 00:57:10,308
I know How Naondo is

580
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,738
I'm counting on you

581
00:57:17,948 --> 00:57:21,338
Please wait until the waitress returns.

582
00:57:21,401 --> 00:57:23,377
It's waste of my time

583
00:57:23,651 --> 00:57:25,237
Wait

584
00:57:25,262 --> 00:57:30,323
Kimiryu has been ill these days

585
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:34,534
But she told me to come for you

586
00:57:39,995 --> 00:57:47,980
Why you doubt me?
I'm not lying when I say I have a cold.

587
00:57:48,911 --> 00:57:53,068
I've come here all the way for you

588
00:57:55,216 --> 00:57:57,388
I see, I get it

589
00:57:58,935 --> 00:58:01,341
Serve me

590
00:58:01,366 --> 00:58:02,388
No way

591
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,521
Don't get upset

592
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:27,208
Will you marry me,Kimiryu

593
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,395
with me?

594
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:34,755
I really mean it

595
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,325
What's wrong with your wife in Sendai?

596
00:58:38,505 --> 00:58:39,966
I'm leaving from her

597
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:44,778
You are my wife is very similar

598
00:58:45,786 --> 00:58:50,060
I can't stand with her attitude

599
00:58:51,216 --> 00:58:52,247
But you are not

600
00:58:53,106 --> 00:58:55,645
I want a woman like you

601
00:58:56,153 --> 00:59:00,677
Suddenly the wind seems to have changed direction.

602
00:59:02,692 --> 00:59:12,051
I think Your wife resents her skills.

603
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:20,061
There is another way for a woman to be happy.

604
00:59:21,365 --> 00:59:26,123
I'm sure She thinks she's happy.

605
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:30,131
I don't think so.
She wants to lose to you

606
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:36,115
But she deliberately doesn't want to lose

607
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:40,787
I bet she is sad all the way

608
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:44,154
How you know?

609
00:59:45,537 --> 00:59:54,756
I am a woman.
I understand woman's mind

610
01:00:09,864 --> 01:00:13,146
The water is deep around here?

611
01:00:14,075 --> 01:00:16,333
It's not shallow

612
01:00:22,157 --> 01:00:28,360
If I don't come out, please help me.

613
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:30,079
I'm counting on you

614
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:47,795
I've decided to live with you in Edo

615
01:00:48,553 --> 01:00:49,381
I can't

616
01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:50,631
Kimiryu

617
01:01:05,085 --> 01:01:06,835
Stop it

618
01:01:11,757 --> 01:01:15,749
I'm sorry I'm drunk

619
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:18,776
Don't be upset

620
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:22,432
Since you are recovering from illness, you can go home early.

621
01:01:24,268 --> 01:01:27,151
I'll see you off

622
01:01:54,357 --> 01:01:58,490
You fought me in Sendai, didn't you?

623
01:01:59,334 --> 01:02:02,529
I want to have a serious fight with you

624
01:02:03,100 --> 01:02:05,600
I can't fight seriously

625
01:02:08,084 --> 01:02:09,764
Hold on.
Tell me the reason

626
01:02:10,803 --> 01:02:14,678
A hitman has no reason to kill you

627
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:17,310
I'll get the woman

628
01:02:26,732 --> 01:02:27,795
Hold on.

629
01:02:29,271 --> 01:02:30,232
Help me

630
01:02:30,654 --> 01:02:31,568
Kimiryu

631
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:35,610
How much you got paid?

632
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,759
I'll pay you twice more

633
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:59,566
I'll pay you 3 times more

634
01:03:19,905 --> 01:03:21,437
I'll pay you 4 times more

635
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,834
I'll pay you 5 times more

636
01:03:34,968 --> 01:03:35,811
I'll take it

637
01:03:43,458 --> 01:03:46,997
You are good business man

638
01:03:47,325 --> 01:03:52,309
Recently, prices are getting higher and life is very difficult.

639
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:55,926
Can I get it?

640
01:03:57,637 --> 01:04:01,848
we were hired for 10 ryo.
So give me 50 ryo

641
01:04:04,692 --> 01:04:05,801
50 ryo?

642
01:04:08,723 --> 01:04:11,786
You don't have the money?

643
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:12,582
I have

644
01:04:12,973 --> 01:04:14,262
So give it to me

645
01:04:14,301 --> 01:04:15,262
I will

646
01:04:15,653 --> 01:04:16,567
Right away

647
01:04:49,383 --> 01:04:50,531
Kimiryu

648
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:56,016
Kimiryu

649
01:04:59,529 --> 01:05:01,966
Kimiryu

650
01:05:22,075 --> 01:05:23,278
Get out

651
01:05:24,927 --> 01:05:28,864
I don't wanna see your face

652
01:05:29,991 --> 01:05:32,178
You're really bad

653
01:05:34,842 --> 01:05:38,842
you are really sissy

654
01:05:40,903 --> 01:05:44,958
without Tatewaki I would be dead

655
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:51,911
You have abandoned me and gone.

656
01:05:53,469 --> 01:05:58,313
I’m really disappointed in you

657
01:06:06,685 --> 01:06:13,286
You are scam of man

658
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:21,466
You will die without anyone liking you.

659
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,916
You will die without anyone liking you.

660
01:06:29,306 --> 01:06:32,267
You will die without anyone liking you.

661
01:07:24,407 --> 01:07:28,071
Hey big news, Naondo has come back

662
01:07:28,503 --> 01:07:29,480
Really?

663
01:07:29,588 --> 01:07:33,190
he comes back after a year

664
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,332
As soon as he came back, he applied for a match with Sada

665
01:07:37,558 --> 01:07:44,019
he said he wanted to have a match with her in front of us

666
01:07:45,105 --> 01:07:46,980
this match is very important to him

667
01:07:47,503 --> 01:07:54,183
he can't afford to lose this game

668
01:07:54,550 --> 01:08:00,886
he might cut his stomach if he loses

669
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:05,191
If he wins, he may hit her

670
01:08:05,964 --> 01:08:07,410
I feel scary

671
01:08:07,964 --> 01:08:10,769
I hope the match will finish soon

672
01:08:11,105 --> 01:08:15,082
But all is not lost when the match is over.

673
01:08:15,488 --> 01:08:20,019
This is not a simple problem to solve

674
01:08:27,246 --> 01:08:29,582
Naondo

675
01:08:36,601 --> 01:08:37,359
Lord

676
01:08:40,164 --> 01:08:43,687
I was worried about you so I came to see you

677
01:08:45,258 --> 01:08:49,195
did you improve your skills?

678
01:08:51,504 --> 01:08:53,058
I don't know

679
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,863
Why you don't know?

680
01:08:57,168 --> 01:09:03,668
My teacher taught me everything and said all you had to do was polish your mind

681
01:09:05,147 --> 01:09:06,608
So you leant?

682
01:09:07,092 --> 01:09:08,725
I don't know

683
01:09:10,178 --> 01:09:14,311
But I think my heart has grown?

684
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:19,186
It doesn't make sense if only your heart grows

685
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:22,022
You have to win to her

686
01:09:23,725 --> 01:09:26,030
Be sure to win

687
01:09:37,755 --> 01:09:41,857
It's time for the match

688
01:10:13,569 --> 01:10:22,655
Please follow the rules of martial arts and fight properly.

689
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:34,077
Ready

690
01:10:34,592 --> 01:10:36,475
Thanks in advance

691
01:10:36,881 --> 01:10:37,835
Same here

692
01:11:40,846 --> 01:11:41,721
Stop!

693
01:12:02,767 --> 01:12:05,080
You made it!

694
01:12:06,182 --> 01:12:09,275
congratulations!

695
01:12:09,900 --> 01:12:18,012
I was going to cut myself if you lost

696
01:12:20,618 --> 01:12:28,415
A man should never lose to a woman

697
01:12:28,572 --> 01:12:32,072
Don't you think so?

698
01:12:34,096 --> 01:12:35,510
You made it!

699
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:17,012
The money you're lending to Naondo is fixed at 4 years' wages, isn't it?

700
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:20,059
Cash rebuilding is 58ryo, isn't it?

701
01:13:20,481 --> 01:13:22,528
It's 61Ryo

702
01:13:22,957 --> 01:13:24,660
I lent him more in Edo

703
01:13:25,254 --> 01:13:27,090
Interest is 3% per year?

704
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:30,817
I will give you 100 ryo

705
01:13:31,434 --> 01:13:34,403
You're kidding.
I don't mean that I want him to return

706
01:13:34,965 --> 01:13:38,895
I thought you went to Edo to return the money.

707
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:45,074
I'm not with that lazy master for the money

708
01:13:46,387 --> 01:13:49,067
I expected to see him as he was today.

709
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,457
You don't know anything

710
01:13:58,799 --> 01:14:00,533
Please

711
01:14:02,416 --> 01:14:03,205
But

712
01:14:03,658 --> 01:14:05,807
I'm asking you

713
01:14:08,752 --> 01:14:12,729
hit me harder

714
01:14:18,643 --> 01:14:20,775
Was it too hard?
Sorry

715
01:14:25,096 --> 01:14:28,213
Forgive me

716
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,080
Gozen

717
01:14:35,291 --> 01:14:37,010
Call me Kazuko

718
01:14:38,955 --> 01:14:40,010
but

719
01:14:40,549 --> 01:14:42,268
Call me Kazuko

720
01:14:44,557 --> 01:14:45,557
Kazuko

721
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:47,049
Lord

722
01:15:28,202 --> 01:15:30,428
Please forgive me

723
01:15:34,365 --> 01:15:38,545
I'm a woman, but I had too much pride in my work.

724
01:15:39,615 --> 01:15:44,717
I have humiliated you so many times.

725
01:15:46,379 --> 01:15:48,770
I think this is a lifelong sin

726
01:15:52,184 --> 01:15:56,770
But I didn't do for myself

727
01:15:59,184 --> 01:16:00,449
Trust me

728
01:16:02,449 --> 01:16:07,106
I love you with all my heart

729
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:11,721
Hold on

730
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:15,995
Kimiryu

731
01:16:23,063 --> 01:16:24,320
Serve me

732
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:38,265
you knew everything

733
01:16:38,772 --> 01:16:40,726
I was confused first

734
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:45,397
Start From Gozodai,Orusiwaku,Tatewaki

735
01:16:46,257 --> 01:16:48,460
And Sagai, they were all together

736
01:16:49,007 --> 01:16:50,624
I was sorry

737
01:16:51,272 --> 01:16:55,835
I feel ashamed of myself

738
01:16:56,046 --> 01:17:01,265
You tried so hard to get me back on my feet.

739
01:17:03,038 --> 01:17:05,640
I really got impressed

740
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:12,959
I didn't understand a woman's heart

741
01:17:14,865 --> 01:17:19,975
I practiced for my stupidity

742
01:17:22,137 --> 01:17:27,598
It's thanks to you that I won to her

743
01:17:30,852 --> 01:17:36,141
I'm so glad

744
01:17:39,466 --> 01:17:43,177
did it hurt when I hit you?

745
01:17:44,122 --> 01:17:45,317
My bad

746
01:17:53,451 --> 01:17:55,787
Serve me

747
01:18:06,009 --> 01:18:09,868
when did you know?

748
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:23,634
Because I used to hang out with a lot of women,so...

749
01:18:26,064 --> 01:18:33,509
I was in this room looking at the mole behind your ear.

750
01:18:35,025 --> 01:18:36,978
I saw it in the boat

751
01:18:41,468 --> 01:18:42,171
Sada

752
01:18:43,492 --> 01:18:44,249
Yes

753
01:18:51,299 --> 01:18:53,291
You won't beat me tonight?

754
01:19:42,934 --> 01:19:43,864
Look at that

755
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,325
That's Lord's palace

756
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:48,082
How about that?

757
01:19:49,223 --> 01:19:52,090
That's Lord's wife's palace

758
01:19:52,825 --> 01:19:54,981
There is only one palace in a castle

759
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:59,715
That palace is no use.
There will be empty from today

760
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:02,082
Lord

761
01:20:04,145 --> 01:20:05,457
Congratulation

762
01:20:08,457 --> 01:20:12,410
Last night I slayed my woman's shadow

763
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:18,411
In return,I am tired

764
01:20:22,457 --> 01:20:23,239
I'm sleepy

765
01:20:24,051 --> 01:20:24,887
How about you?

766
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,372
Same here

767
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:29,317
Shall we have a nap?

768
01:20:58,710 --> 01:21:02,265
I drunk with my wife for the first time in long time

769
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:04,648
I stayed over night

770
01:21:06,492 --> 01:21:08,007
I am tired

771
01:21:13,328 --> 01:21:15,312
I will sleep here too

772
01:21:26,382 --> 01:21:27,093
Hey

773
01:21:29,226 --> 01:21:32,664
Don't play Drum today

774
01:21:34,171 --> 01:21:38,617
And so it was a quiet afternoon at Aoba Castle.

775
01:21:40,351 --> 01:21:47,101
Since then the noon drumming has been discontinued.

776
01:21:47,852 --> 01:21:53,461
THE END

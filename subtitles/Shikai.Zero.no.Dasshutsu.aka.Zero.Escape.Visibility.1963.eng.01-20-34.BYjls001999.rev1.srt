2
00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:18,719
Kagoshima

3
00:00:34,811 --> 00:00:35,858
Hey wake up

4
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:37,546
Wake up

5
00:00:49,265 --> 00:00:52,390
I'm sorry you're tired, but I need you to fly to Amami Oshima again.

6
00:00:53,124 --> 00:00:54,132
What did you just say?

7
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:55,132
What?

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,164
If you're sorry, don't ask me to do it.

9
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:07,958
It's hot

10
00:01:07,983 --> 00:01:10,044
This is an urgent job and the pay is high.

11
00:01:11,044 --> 00:01:12,286
I don't want money

12
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:16,528
But it comes with something special

13
00:01:17,348 --> 00:01:17,880
What?

14
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:38,993
I'm sorry, sir.

15
00:01:41,336 --> 00:01:42,844
What's going on?
Is someone hurt?

16
00:01:43,125 --> 00:01:44,688
go to the island and ask her

17
00:01:45,829 --> 00:01:46,469
Please

18
00:01:52,223 --> 00:01:54,083
I hate women who smell like medicine

19
00:02:01,427 --> 00:02:02,591
Ok let's go

20
00:02:12,248 --> 00:02:19,724
Escape from Zero Visibility / Zero Escape Visibility (1963)
(Shikai Zero no Dasshutsu)

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:13,885
That day was the hottest on record according to weather station reports.

22
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,987
I got back from the Genkai Sea fish finder at one o'clock in the afternoon.

23
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:37,069
Excuse me

24
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:40,358
I'm tired.
I wish you'd shut up.

25
00:04:42,124 --> 00:04:43,538
I'm tired too.

26
00:04:46,046 --> 00:04:49,944
I was in the hospital, finally out of surgery, and they ordered me to go to Amami Oshima right away.

27
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:51,788
You know how I feel.

28
00:04:52,757 --> 00:04:56,366
I flew to the Genkai Sea in the morning, and when I finally got home...
I'm your companion now

29
00:04:56,741 --> 00:04:57,562
What's the hell

30
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,663
But I'm going because it's important.

31
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,882
For The kids.

32
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,898
I'm not into kids

33
00:05:32,255 --> 00:05:35,669
I hope you're not too good with airplanes.

34
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,431
use this bag

35
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:49,611
i hate flying

36
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:51,290
You'd rather use a boat

37
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,330
I have to be at the island hospital by 4:00 p.m.

38
00:05:57,087 --> 00:05:57,861
It's 2pm

39
00:05:59,111 --> 00:06:02,033
An hour and a half at most.
We'll be there soon

40
00:06:05,643 --> 00:06:06,604
Do you feel safe?

41
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,674
what do you do with that pistol?

42
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,463
Use this to kill sharks when they fall into the ocean

43
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,229
You fall into the ocean?

44
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:26,916
Please keep this if you are worried.

45
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:47,547
This is sky island

46
00:06:50,564 --> 00:06:51,368
From where?

47
00:06:52,978 --> 00:06:54,407
That island's team

48
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:56,024
That island's team?

49
00:06:58,235 --> 00:07:02,134
an emergency has occurred

50
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,084
please land immediately

51
00:07:04,764 --> 00:07:09,342
Wind speed 65M.
the runway is short

52
00:07:09,441 --> 00:07:11,589
So please be careful

53
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:15,589
I'm so unlucky today

54
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:17,800
is something wrong?

55
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:19,402
They are calling us

56
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:22,597
How much time do you have?

57
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,308
I'm sure it's just another medical emergency.

58
00:07:24,363 --> 00:07:26,699
I was dropped off the other day carrying an appendectomy patient.

59
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:28,339
Is there a doctor on the island?

60
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:32,183
There's a small fishing village on the cape.That's all

61
00:08:02,369 --> 00:08:03,338
We'll land on

62
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:41,129
We landed on

63
00:08:42,394 --> 00:08:44,402
It's an emergency, so please come immediately.

64
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:46,933
I get it

65
00:08:57,026 --> 00:08:59,722
Please tell me the detail

66
00:09:00,971 --> 00:09:03,229
It's an emergency, so please come immediately.

67
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:05,182
I get it

68
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:11,002
Come with me.
There is an air conditioner and it is cool

69
00:09:11,229 --> 00:09:12,893
I'll be waiting.

70
00:09:19,151 --> 00:09:19,831
What's that?

71
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:21,831
It's a live vaccine for infantile paralysis.

72
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:23,557
vaccine?

73
00:09:23,917 --> 00:09:26,581
That's why I'm in such a hurry.
I have to be there by 4:00.

74
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,463
If I'm not there by 4:00, the dry ice will melt.

75
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,650
Why didn't you just say so?

76
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,088
I'll be back soon

77
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,799
Please.

78
00:10:09,534 --> 00:10:12,034
Thanks for your help.
We've been waiting for you

79
00:10:12,292 --> 00:10:14,307
Who are you?
I'm sure you are not working here

80
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,362
What's wrong?

81
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:23,386
You'll know if you come

82
00:10:37,406 --> 00:10:38,007
Senior

83
00:10:42,148 --> 00:10:44,195
What's wrong?
what happened to the plane that crashed?

84
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,187
Don't touch them or I'll shoot you

85
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,658
What's the hell about this?

86
00:10:57,338 --> 00:10:59,393
It's easy to tell if you're kidding or not.

87
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:04,010
Are you alright too?

88
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:09,033
There are only men here, so men will attack you.

89
00:11:11,235 --> 00:11:15,805
They are crazy. don't get involved with them

90
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:55,341
If you give me a plane, I will spare your lives.

91
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:56,896
Me and airplane?

92
00:11:57,872 --> 00:12:04,318
They crash landed, so they used you to escape from here.

93
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:13,362
There is a small fishing village on the cape.There is a site back of them

94
00:12:15,716 --> 00:12:17,763
did you fly alone?

95
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,138
Yeah

96
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,434
It's ok if I give you the plane but What about the pilot?

97
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,288
Sorry

98
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,098
I've got about 2,500 hours on the plane.

99
00:12:37,153 --> 00:12:41,465
That plane doesn't often fly if it's not for me.

100
00:12:42,223 --> 00:12:43,606
I have no idea

101
00:12:45,668 --> 00:12:47,356
I like that kind of plane

102
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,239
You sure?

103
00:12:49,731 --> 00:12:51,793
Get the plane now

104
00:13:04,834 --> 00:13:07,686
This is still a joke.

105
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:11,318
I'm not ordinally guy

106
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:13,826
You turned me mad

107
00:14:13,283 --> 00:14:14,486
I saw someone

108
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:44,757
Damn it

109
00:14:47,757 --> 00:14:48,695
What's wrong?

110
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:05,949
How about there?

111
00:15:10,481 --> 00:15:12,137
We don't have enough gas to get where we're going.

112
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:13,715
gas ?

113
00:15:17,367 --> 00:15:21,281
I don't know how far you're going, but it's enough to get you to Okinawa.

114
00:16:16,203 --> 00:16:18,054
I looked upstairs, but gasoline is nowhere to be found.

115
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,054
What are we gonna do?

116
00:16:20,242 --> 00:16:22,687
If we don't have enough, we'll just replenish it.

117
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:25,757
Is there anything else out of the ordinary?

118
00:16:26,272 --> 00:16:28,171
It's too late for that if you miss them

119
00:16:29,108 --> 00:16:30,608
I like the plane

120
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:33,999
And this

121
00:16:35,304 --> 00:16:36,608
do you like women stuff?

122
00:16:36,718 --> 00:16:38,608
Hurry up and get some gas.

123
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:42,538
this is not an airport

124
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:44,257
How could you not have stored it?

125
00:16:44,282 --> 00:16:45,108
We don't have it

126
00:16:45,585 --> 00:16:47,702
This island would have also served as an evacuation airport.

127
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,046
How could an evacuated plane fly over without gas?

128
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:51,999
We don't have it

129
00:16:52,272 --> 00:16:55,030
If in doubt, check the airport.

130
00:16:56,163 --> 00:16:56,983
Are you sure?

131
00:16:57,288 --> 00:16:59,030
If in doubt, check it

132
00:17:01,398 --> 00:17:05,133
You can't refuel immediately.
It was still landed on the cape due to the typhoon.

133
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,531
How long does it take?

134
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:08,609
It takes 40 minutes round trip by car

135
00:17:08,789 --> 00:17:09,844
Guide me

136
00:17:10,547 --> 00:17:11,547
What if I say no?

137
00:17:12,062 --> 00:17:15,453
I'll kill you in a raw

138
00:17:16,525 --> 00:17:17,384
I'll give you the guide

139
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:18,595
Yoshimoto

140
00:17:19,946 --> 00:17:24,806
I've been bitching and moaning about the mundane nature of my job day in and day out, but I never thought it would be this exciting.

141
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,808
Bring us the car

142
00:17:28,183 --> 00:17:29,550
no wireless

143
00:17:30,308 --> 00:17:31,511
There was hand pottery on top

144
00:17:31,972 --> 00:17:32,542
hand pottery ?

145
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:38,638
For short distances it is enough

146
00:17:43,154 --> 00:17:45,380
you do bad things we kill you

147
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:50,029
I'm still single.
I don't wanna die

148
00:17:54,684 --> 00:17:57,012
What about the gasoline?

149
00:17:57,622 --> 00:18:00,723
We're going to the Cape to get it.
I'll take you there now. You wait in the car.

150
00:18:12,956 --> 00:18:15,972
This kind of problem happened because of you

151
00:18:16,402 --> 00:18:18,902
Look,The chartered plane crashed

152
00:18:19,152 --> 00:18:21,636
We found a new plane, but I'm running out of gas

153
00:18:22,441 --> 00:18:24,011
we may escape from here next year

154
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,332
Stop drinking

155
00:18:27,871 --> 00:18:31,215
I'm an errand boy

156
00:18:31,996 --> 00:18:35,301
All you want is a drink and a girl, and you're in.

157
00:18:37,793 --> 00:18:39,676
You found that

158
00:18:55,054 --> 00:18:57,601
Stay alert.
Call me if you see anything out of the ordinary.

159
00:19:47,383 --> 00:19:52,180
I haven't smelled a woman in two months and she has a Pistol, I'm mad.

160
00:19:54,059 --> 00:20:02,207
Please continue with your duties as usual.
But no radio calls or phone calls from the outside
Do as I say.

161
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:05,653
What if I don't?

162
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,281
What the hell are you doing this for?

163
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:20,359
Why don't you mind your own business You should be thinking about taking me down.

164
00:20:25,686 --> 00:20:26,460
person with bad leg

165
00:20:33,209 --> 00:20:34,568
What's the hell?

166
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:44,068
If you call me person with bad leg, I will never forgive you.

167
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:59,912
There are some things people don't want you to touch.

168
00:21:00,944 --> 00:21:02,530
Don't tell me anymore

169
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,527
What's the one thing you don't want people to touch?

170
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:09,308
That's what I'm more interested in.

171
00:21:17,501 --> 00:21:18,501
Who take the phone?

172
00:21:29,136 --> 00:21:32,237
Answer any questions you have.
The answer is "all clear.

173
00:21:32,527 --> 00:21:34,128
I understand English.

174
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,028
Hello?
This is Sasarito site

175
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:42,786
About a direct flight to Amami Oshima?

176
00:21:45,785 --> 00:21:49,371
It went through about 20 minutes ago.

177
00:21:51,207 --> 00:21:52,597
Everything is fine.

178
00:21:56,668 --> 00:21:59,308
I will contact you as soon as I have more information.

179
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,357
I get it

180
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:05,350
From where?

181
00:22:08,553 --> 00:22:09,381
Kagoshima.

182
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,209
They're worried they haven't heard from the plane.

183
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:15,225
We are always quick to exchange information

184
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:18,084
We'd be quicker to refill our tanks with gas.

185
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:02,215
This is Tokyo BM

186
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:08,246
This is Tokyo BM

187
00:23:17,552 --> 00:23:18,998
This is Tokyo BM

188
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,490
Where are you calling this?

189
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:23,279
Hong Kong or Saigon or somewhere.

190
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:26,080
She's smart

191
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,885
You falling love?

192
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:31,150
It seems she is not yours

193
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,057
What the hell is that girl?

194
00:23:33,408 --> 00:23:34,447
Are you into her?

195
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:38,134
I go crazy if I don't talk about something.

196
00:23:40,264 --> 00:23:42,209
I like to talk a lot

197
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,100
We all get the short end of the stick once in a while.

198
00:23:47,522 --> 00:23:49,663
So don't do bad things

199
00:23:50,717 --> 00:23:52,038
what experience have you had?

200
00:23:53,835 --> 00:23:57,100
It's none of your business

201
00:24:04,286 --> 00:24:08,302
I'm on the brink of having my precious plane taken away from me.

202
00:24:08,474 --> 00:24:10,591
I have a right to know who you are.

203
00:24:23,303 --> 00:24:26,998
I see. So It's the one who revealed it.

204
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:35,650
Untie them,
They can't run and hide!

205
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:38,331
you don't want to die,right?

206
00:24:49,774 --> 00:24:51,024
Don't do anything unnecessary.

207
00:24:54,929 --> 00:24:56,002
Counterfeit money.

208
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,630
How could you tell?
Take the time to appreciate it.

209
00:24:59,889 --> 00:25:01,129
This is kind of art

210
00:25:02,122 --> 00:25:05,022
So you are an artist?

211
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:12,145
Yes,It's funny how some places charge more for this counterfeit money than the real thing.

212
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:15,730
That's ridiculous.

213
00:25:16,591 --> 00:25:19,691
The small countries of Southeast Asia that are now struggling with uprisings

214
00:25:20,994 --> 00:25:24,054
Wars aren't fought with guns and machine guns alone.

215
00:25:25,284 --> 00:25:28,731
They use these counterfeit bills to tear apart the other country's economy.

216
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,508
These counterfeit bills cost more than the real thing.

217
00:25:32,388 --> 00:25:33,174
I see.

218
00:25:34,642 --> 00:25:36,935
The Japanese Army used to distribute them during the war.

219
00:25:37,824 --> 00:25:39,117
That was called B-bill

220
00:25:39,377 --> 00:25:40,623
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

221
00:25:41,094 --> 00:25:44,540
As long as there's a war on, our business will thrive.

222
00:25:45,082 --> 00:25:46,208
You are smart

223
00:25:46,266 --> 00:25:48,319
Yes She is

224
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:48,959
Stop

225
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:53,686
Her father used to make copies with a sophisticated printing press.

226
00:25:54,425 --> 00:26:01,514
He was hired by a special agency of a certain country during the Korean War to print a lot of counterfeit money for a lot of money.

227
00:26:02,923 --> 00:26:06,796
The war was over, he never came home.

228
00:26:07,789 --> 00:26:09,489
He knew their secret so he was killed

229
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,816
Use your brains while you're alive, man.

230
00:26:19,641 --> 00:26:23,961
So you're a woman and you're waving a gun?
It's too good to be true.

231
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,613
Give me

232
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:22,120
I want women!

233
00:27:28,054 --> 00:27:29,580
He did it again

234
00:27:36,633 --> 00:27:38,700
Never mind

235
00:27:56,015 --> 00:27:57,108
Watch out,Emi

236
00:27:58,786 --> 00:27:59,819
I'm going to check the front.

237
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:30,952
Guns?

238
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,272
Don't worry.
There was a messenger pigeon up there.

239
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:36,726
messenger pidgeon?

240
00:29:37,983 --> 00:29:39,077
Did you kill him?

241
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,097
You sure?

242
00:29:43,805 --> 00:29:45,105
I don't wanna kill bird

243
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:46,378
But you like to kill people

244
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,512
Don't worry about the pigeons.

245
00:29:48,781 --> 00:29:51,181
I don't think he works well

246
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:52,714
You are too sweet

247
00:29:52,739 --> 00:29:53,774
Stop it

248
00:30:38,075 --> 00:30:39,275
Stay strong. we are working

249
00:30:39,949 --> 00:30:41,355
Work on your own

250
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:45,229
All is your fault

251
00:30:51,823 --> 00:30:53,363
Stop here

252
00:30:53,388 --> 00:30:54,371
Keep driving

253
00:30:54,708 --> 00:30:56,181
There's a women

254
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,193
So what?

255
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,833
I don't want to miss it

256
00:31:02,047 --> 00:31:05,213
We can't afford to do it

257
00:31:06,113 --> 00:31:07,380
What's the hell?

258
00:31:11,118 --> 00:31:12,498
Stop here

259
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,740
He's passed out.

260
00:31:34,174 --> 00:31:37,467
We'll get him after

261
00:31:39,654 --> 00:31:40,654
Wait

262
00:32:02,741 --> 00:32:04,674
Are you alright?

263
00:32:09,714 --> 00:32:10,834
Are you alright?

264
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:13,334
You are member of site?

265
00:32:14,397 --> 00:32:17,064
This is serious injure, what happened?

266
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,405
Who you are?

267
00:32:20,045 --> 00:32:25,998
I flew in.
I heard about the site, called the police, and I was hooked.

268
00:32:27,616 --> 00:32:29,656
But there's no house around here

269
00:32:32,463 --> 00:32:37,523
Bad guys are trying to break into the site. They're trying to steal your plane.

270
00:32:38,167 --> 00:32:40,247
Is the pilot man okay?

271
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:42,133
He'll be in danger

272
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:46,635
They're all armed with handguns, so you'd better stay away from them.

273
00:32:48,504 --> 00:32:49,490
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

274
00:32:55,554 --> 00:32:58,174
The dry ice is melting a lot

275
00:32:59,873 --> 00:33:03,673
I was going to go to SITE because I heard they have air conditioning.

276
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:08,266
Stop it

277
00:33:43,431 --> 00:33:45,211
You tricked me

278
00:33:47,713 --> 00:33:50,246
I'm just kidding, sorry

279
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:05,479
You shouldn't do anything you're not used to doing.

280
00:34:09,483 --> 00:34:10,877
I'll shoot you

281
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,503
There is a safety device.

282
00:34:23,749 --> 00:34:27,109
This is how you shoot when you hit a person

283
00:34:37,748 --> 00:34:39,688
Stay away!

284
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,062
Help me

285
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,217
Stay away!

286
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:45,888
It's hot.
What are they doing out there?

287
00:36:58,762 --> 00:37:02,836
Hi Sasorijima site, this is Kagoshima Agent

288
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,967
Reporting on a regular basis.

289
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:06,160
What should we do?

290
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,022
Where you going?
This is Reporting on a regular basis.

291
00:37:19,215 --> 00:37:23,182
Flip the switch.
If you don't report it, it'll look suspicious.

292
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:27,718
This is Sasorijima site, Reporting on a regular basis please

293
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:36,746
Northeast wind 30 knots

294
00:37:37,831 --> 00:37:40,104
atmospheric pressure 1600 millibars

295
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,176
temperature 34

296
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:46,755
Kumamoto cloud cover

297
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,389
We're getting ready

298
00:37:51,132 --> 00:37:53,638
1122 millibars

299
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:55,858
Just reporting please

300
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:57,897
We were doing a typhoon observation.

301
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:01,204
We are not supposed to contact them unless they ask for a weather report.

302
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:06,356
Amami Oshima will be prioritized first.
Nothing to worry about.

303
00:38:23,477 --> 00:38:24,671
It's Squall.

304
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:28,510
It's heavy

305
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,616
I worry about Runway

306
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:34,784
You need my help?

307
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:52,191
I have a good idea

308
00:38:54,898 --> 00:38:56,658
They worry about runway

309
00:38:57,634 --> 00:39:02,368
And pigeon.
He will go up to feed him

310
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:13,301
You know what?
There's one woman

311
00:39:15,356 --> 00:39:19,114
That woman will definitely be on watch.

312
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:21,048
You divert her attention

313
00:39:23,063 --> 00:39:24,626
Or I'll do that

314
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:30,345
Don't run away

315
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:33,727
What are you talking about?

316
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:53,357
I was surprised last year when there was a typhoon.
Wind speeds of 60 meters per hour.

317
00:39:53,872 --> 00:39:56,224
we were blown away by the wind

318
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:59,396
You could fly to the sky

319
00:39:59,943 --> 00:40:02,474
No more boats, no more rice.

320
00:40:03,107 --> 00:40:05,044
We had to go to the Cape in the storm to buy food.

321
00:40:05,818 --> 00:40:08,224
I'd end up licking dried bonito flakes and drinking the water.

322
00:40:08,693 --> 00:40:10,552
I was like a cat

323
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:13,757
I see.
Is this what you guys do for a living?

324
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,171
You're bored out of your mind.

325
00:40:17,569 --> 00:40:20,249
It's what keeps us pilots flying.

326
00:40:21,155 --> 00:40:23,179
You have no idea how much we appreciate it.

327
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:28,044
I feel sorry for you.

328
00:40:28,544 --> 00:40:30,607
Not seeing a woman for a year or two.

329
00:40:30,997 --> 00:40:32,357
Just like you.

330
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,193
You're not into me

331
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,685
I'm sorry but...

332
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,216
You love pidgeon more?

333
00:40:47,748 --> 00:40:51,623
Bad news.
This runway won't jump up if it gets any wetter.

334
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:53,170
Right?

335
00:40:56,732 --> 00:40:58,294
i go to feed the pigeons

336
00:41:04,325 --> 00:41:05,810
I'm not letting you out.

337
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:07,404
i go to feed the pigeons

338
00:41:07,568 --> 00:41:08,232
Hold on

339
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:12,036
I'm gonna go check on the run-up to the airfield.

340
00:41:14,962 --> 00:41:16,173
Where are you going?

341
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:18,775
I'm going to take a record.

342
00:41:19,509 --> 00:41:20,158
Hey

343
00:41:21,717 --> 00:41:22,217
You?

344
00:41:22,374 --> 00:41:24,147
I'm going to bathroom

345
00:41:51,928 --> 00:41:53,248
Don't move or I'll shoot you

346
00:42:06,452 --> 00:42:07,225
You

347
00:42:08,522 --> 00:42:11,936
You lied to me about being alone.

348
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,596
I knew

349
00:42:31,979 --> 00:42:32,924
You knew?

350
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:35,619
I heard you on the radio.

351
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:37,143
Then why you came?

352
00:42:37,947 --> 00:42:39,220
I was wondering about the vaccine

353
00:42:39,245 --> 00:42:39,869
vaccine ?

354
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:42,455
Paralysis has struck again?

355
00:42:44,216 --> 00:42:46,567
I heard this place has air conditioning.

356
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,333
So you've prepared yourself.

357
00:42:49,348 --> 00:42:54,630
I don't care what happens to me, please protect the vaccine.

358
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:57,183
Stay strong

359
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:24,661
You were trapped

360
00:43:27,981 --> 00:43:30,348
One of your guys is out cold out there.

361
00:43:31,364 --> 00:43:33,965
Who?
Tell me

362
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:38,142
A big guy.
His head was bleeding.

363
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,642
he was alone?

364
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:40,673
Yes

365
00:43:40,698 --> 00:43:41,368
How about the car?

366
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:42,399
I have no idea

367
00:43:42,556 --> 00:43:43,735
Damn it

368
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,446
I’ll go check

369
00:43:45,626 --> 00:43:46,642
no need for that

370
00:43:47,316 --> 00:43:49,464
If there's something wrong, they'll call us with the hand pottery.

371
00:43:49,948 --> 00:43:51,534
They were just arguing

372
00:43:51,566 --> 00:43:52,480
How about Daimon?

373
00:43:52,886 --> 00:43:55,113
We don't need him anymore

374
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:56,613
I see

375
00:44:12,558 --> 00:44:15,074
What the hell is that?
I hope you didn't put anything suspicious in there.

376
00:44:16,949 --> 00:44:18,199
It's dry ice.

377
00:44:18,691 --> 00:44:20,371
It's got live vaccine in it.

378
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:21,988
Touch it and you'll get scalded.

379
00:44:22,636 --> 00:44:23,308
Childhood paralysis.

380
00:44:25,175 --> 00:44:28,120
I see, anyway come with me

381
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:25,927
You'll be over

382
00:45:30,974 --> 00:45:33,521
You tripped me

383
00:45:33,716 --> 00:45:35,216
You're just realizing that now?

384
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:37,920
I won't forgive you

385
00:45:37,945 --> 00:45:39,334
Just bring it on

386
00:45:40,629 --> 00:45:42,207
Come on!

387
00:46:31,006 --> 00:46:33,178
did the volcano erupt?

388
00:46:35,522 --> 00:46:36,834
That was a gasoline explosion.

389
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,416
what the hell do they do?

390
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,571
This is Sasorijima Island site

391
00:47:19,743 --> 00:47:24,337
Criminals have infiltrated and paralyzed the functionality of the site.

392
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:26,048
Please help us

393
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:30,595
Please help us

394
00:47:36,796 --> 00:47:39,842
This is Sasorijima Island site

395
00:47:43,186 --> 00:47:45,569
What the hell?

396
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:49,683
Can you handle them by yourself?

397
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:53,979
I'll take care of it.
Why don't you take her with you?

398
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:57,229
Perhaps he's injured.

399
00:47:58,706 --> 00:48:00,831
so we should take her

400
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,200
Come !

401
00:48:10,154 --> 00:48:11,513
She's tried

402
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:12,685
Don't pretend you are good

403
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:18,283
She decides if she goes or not.

404
00:48:18,518 --> 00:48:20,761
But you're still human.

405
00:48:20,786 --> 00:48:21,886
Yes I am

406
00:48:23,112 --> 00:48:23,901
Tell me

407
00:48:23,926 --> 00:48:25,237
I'd go

408
00:48:26,518 --> 00:48:28,901
you have to protect her with your life

409
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:32,339
It's none of my business

410
00:48:41,088 --> 00:48:42,455
I need rescue

411
00:48:43,799 --> 00:48:45,698
I need rescue

412
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:54,843
This is Sasorijima Island site

413
00:48:56,648 --> 00:49:01,375
Criminals have infiltrated and paralyzed the functionality of the site.

414
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:05,443
I need rescue

415
00:49:09,578 --> 00:49:12,703
This is Sasorijima Island site

416
00:49:14,336 --> 00:49:17,336
I'm informing you

417
00:49:18,266 --> 00:49:21,891
Criminals have infiltrated and paralyzed the functionality of the site.

418
00:49:21,953 --> 00:49:24,523
The longer you wait, the more likely it is that this radio will be used to call the plane.

419
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:27,344
And your plan's not gonna work.

420
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,187
I don't think that radio will work

421
00:49:48,054 --> 00:49:52,789
Criminals have infiltrated and paralyzed the functionality of the site.

422
00:49:54,855 --> 00:49:57,074
I need rescue

423
00:49:57,488 --> 00:49:59,277
I need rescue

424
00:51:00,166 --> 00:51:01,181
It's boring to be alone?

425
00:51:03,041 --> 00:51:07,353
I know what you're thinking right now.

426
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:09,791
Let you guess.

427
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:13,564
You're gonna find an opening and you're gonna take me out

428
00:51:13,845 --> 00:51:14,564
No

429
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,150
I'm thinking about the goldfish.

430
00:51:18,244 --> 00:51:21,423
Even though he's grown up, it's hot and he's about to die

431
00:51:24,416 --> 00:51:26,650
Forget about me

432
00:51:27,236 --> 00:51:29,533
It's easy to shoot you guys

433
00:51:30,173 --> 00:51:34,564
We're bare-knuckled.
We won't die

434
00:51:37,757 --> 00:51:39,140
You're the best.

435
00:51:42,523 --> 00:51:44,820
I'm not supposed to say anything if I'm not good enough.

436
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:48,640
So I pay attention on you

437
00:52:09,992 --> 00:52:13,438
You got a nice body.

438
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:16,977
You like it?

439
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:22,866
I may have seduced you

440
00:52:23,084 --> 00:52:26,303
because you were always with that ugly man

441
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:32,100
I was just kidding

442
00:52:32,163 --> 00:52:33,577
you are a coward

443
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,585
I'm asking about the scar on your neck.

444
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:41,658
it is his medal

445
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:42,486
it is his medal?

446
00:52:42,643 --> 00:52:43,424
Stop saying it

447
00:52:43,908 --> 00:52:45,783
When He had just become a pilot..

448
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:51,160
He was flying a plane to Shikoku with a load of passengers.
He crash-landed at sea in bad weather.

449
00:52:53,246 --> 00:52:56,879
He ejected the passengers.
But he got a lot of scars for it.

450
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,215
You are brave

451
00:52:58,793 --> 00:53:03,809
His mother told me to stay out of the dangerous business when she saw the scars.

452
00:53:04,535 --> 00:53:08,153
He thought so for a while, too.
But then he changed his mind.

453
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:14,817
He saved the lives of three passengers.

454
00:53:15,872 --> 00:53:19,200
A pilot with a pretty body is not a real pilot.

455
00:53:20,317 --> 00:53:21,966
A scar is the medal of honor of Pilot Rock.

456
00:53:23,528 --> 00:53:27,364
I've tried to value human life ever since.

457
00:53:27,786 --> 00:53:28,895
That's why I'm a coward.

458
00:53:30,531 --> 00:53:34,321
It's easy enough not to beat the shit out of one of you.

459
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:37,164
But try losing one of these lives.

460
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:39,969
You're young and you're a hard worker

461
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:42,664
That's why I don't know how you feel.

462
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:49,688
When your father died, why didn't you want to take over the fine business of copying on a printing press?

463
00:53:51,472 --> 00:53:52,933
Why did you print counterfeit money?

464
00:53:54,597 --> 00:53:58,933
When people are in pain, they can either be trained or they can be crushed.

465
00:54:00,058 --> 00:54:02,308
Why were you crushed?

466
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:05,761
are you going to preach to me even though it's hot

467
00:54:07,332 --> 00:54:09,207
I wonder if the air conditioning is on.

468
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:11,215
Air conditioning is for machines.

469
00:54:11,910 --> 00:54:14,433
It's over 35 degrees in the human quarters.

470
00:54:14,636 --> 00:54:16,543
This is no place for ladies.

471
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:19,285
We're always in our underwear.

472
00:54:21,371 --> 00:54:23,660
Even when it wasn't hot, I wanted to strip naked.

473
00:54:25,472 --> 00:54:27,425
i won't forgive you

474
00:54:27,972 --> 00:54:29,386
I know you are a coward

475
00:54:30,269 --> 00:54:31,480
Give it a shot

476
00:54:50,558 --> 00:54:52,151
It's hot and this may have broken

477
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:14,996
Don't look down on me

478
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,802
I become stronger because the scars increase

479
00:55:20,903 --> 00:55:22,278
Be careful

480
00:55:35,702 --> 00:55:37,734
This is kyowa ship

481
00:55:37,929 --> 00:55:40,343
Relief communication intercepted.

482
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:44,655
This is kyowa ship

483
00:55:44,734 --> 00:55:47,116
Relief communication intercepted.

484
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:11,293
My goldfish died.

485
00:56:13,332 --> 00:56:14,598
he  went down easy.

486
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,012
You're no better than the goldfish.

487
00:56:19,426 --> 00:56:22,199
Maybe it's you who's the goldfish.

488
00:56:22,224 --> 00:56:23,527
What are you going to do?

489
00:56:23,574 --> 00:56:24,644
I'll bury the goldfish in the soil

490
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,941
it's my responsibility to do it

491
00:56:27,059 --> 00:56:29,785
I'm not letting you out of here.

492
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:30,793
What should I do then?

493
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:32,347
Flush it down the toilet.

494
00:56:34,504 --> 00:56:35,699
You are so mean

495
00:56:44,866 --> 00:56:46,522
There's a PISTOL in the first aid kit.

496
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:52,416
Turn off the lights when you get a chance.

497
00:57:00,953 --> 00:57:02,110
Phone call

498
00:57:04,227 --> 00:57:05,281
You know right?

499
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,329
Hello? Hello?

500
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:15,305
Hello? Hello?

501
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:19,312
This is Sasorijima Island site

502
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:31,966
Did a fishing boat intercept the rescue transmission?

503
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:38,183
It is something wrong

504
00:57:41,026 --> 00:57:45,573
No communication is sent from here

505
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:24,479
Don't move

506
00:58:30,338 --> 00:58:32,745
Don't move or kill them

507
00:59:36,794 --> 00:59:42,708
Intercepted a rescue message in the Southern Sea.

508
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:49,566
Intercepted a rescue message in the Southern Sea.

509
00:59:50,042 --> 00:59:53,902
Please check the status

510
01:00:30,808 --> 01:00:36,198
I was surprised when she got a pistol

511
01:00:38,874 --> 01:00:40,242
Where's the Pistol?

512
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:43,234
I threw that thing away.

513
01:00:43,492 --> 01:00:45,054
Don't tell a lie

514
01:00:51,445 --> 01:00:53,031
How about Mikami?

515
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:59,140
He was burned by a gasoline blowout.

516
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:01,695
How about Yoshimoto?

517
01:01:01,922 --> 01:01:04,718
I can't find him.

518
01:01:07,508 --> 01:01:09,218
No wonder he's dead, that young man.

519
01:01:09,476 --> 01:01:12,828
All you had to do was pick her up.

520
01:01:14,476 --> 01:01:15,875
But she's fuckable

521
01:01:21,345 --> 01:01:24,400
Say it again.
I'll beat you

522
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:27,542
It's none of your business

523
01:01:27,711 --> 01:01:31,992
you can't get any woman

524
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:37,687
This is no time to be fighting amongst yourselves.

525
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:47,445
It's time to get mad.

526
01:01:48,922 --> 01:01:51,781
No matter how much you squirm, you'll never get gasoline or a pilot.

527
01:01:53,196 --> 01:01:57,477
You said the more wounds I take, the stronger I get.

528
01:01:58,242 --> 01:02:01,453
I think a scratch like that would be enough to fly a plane.

529
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,899
my shoulder hurts because of you

530
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:07,016
What's more important, your shoulder or your heart?

531
01:02:07,289 --> 01:02:10,492
I see, But what about gasoline?

532
01:02:12,884 --> 01:02:17,126
I thought you said it would last all the way to Okinawa.
I'll take care of the rest.

533
01:02:18,423 --> 01:02:20,048
we will endure a little

534
01:02:21,251 --> 01:02:24,118
What about the vaccine?
I need to get it to them.

535
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:27,391
I'm sorry, but we are  not going to Amami.
You'll just give up.

536
01:02:28,596 --> 01:02:31,869
You people don't have a soul.

537
01:02:32,815 --> 01:02:37,846
Right now in Amami, little kids and their mothers are waiting like crazy for this vaccine.

538
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:44,942
Every minute or second we delay, the more children will get sick.

539
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:48,138
You are crippled too, aren't you?

540
01:02:48,724 --> 01:02:50,623
I think you know how children feel

541
01:02:50,990 --> 01:02:53,201
do you know why i have bad leg?

542
01:02:53,998 --> 01:02:56,099
Caused by infantile paralysis

543
01:02:57,169 --> 01:02:59,451
that was very painful

544
01:02:59,849 --> 01:03:01,474
Why did you do this ?

545
01:03:02,404 --> 01:03:05,709
When I was a kid, they didn't have vaccines.

546
01:03:05,888 --> 01:03:07,013
What does that matter?

547
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:13,005
I just want the world to know how I was painfil

548
01:03:13,884 --> 01:03:17,853
If you use that vaccine, the children will get well soon.

549
01:03:18,392 --> 01:03:22,962
That could be fine

550
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:26,853
you are heart numb

551
01:03:27,392 --> 01:03:31,439
It could be
but who made me that?

552
01:03:32,032 --> 01:03:38,970
These are rich people living in the lap of luxury.
who are humming and driving and bouncing off the muddy water

553
01:03:40,241 --> 01:03:43,210
i want to make them sick

554
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:46,835
you're crazy since you were born

555
01:03:48,376 --> 01:03:49,868
It could be

556
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:53,517
Hello,Poilot

557
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:05,030
I'm looking for a marine near the 101st.

558
01:04:05,287 --> 01:04:09,772
I'm looking for a marine near the 101st.

559
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:12,694
It seems to have been contacted

560
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,412
A rescue plane is heading here.

561
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:16,428
What should you do?

562
01:04:30,229 --> 01:04:34,689
I am searching for SOS at sea

563
01:04:34,971 --> 01:04:40,018
I am searching for SOS at sea

564
01:04:40,541 --> 01:04:43,002
please let me know if you have any information

565
01:04:44,064 --> 01:04:45,744
The rescue message is a false alarm

566
01:04:47,135 --> 01:04:50,080
Are you sure?
Please check it

567
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:54,400
I'm sure The rescue message is a false alarm

568
01:04:55,393 --> 01:04:56,424
I get it

569
01:05:37,826 --> 01:05:40,810
Please ask why it is false

570
01:05:41,349 --> 01:05:44,193
all is well on our side

571
01:05:45,927 --> 01:05:49,294
can you hear me, pilot

572
01:05:51,513 --> 01:05:55,466
Landing is invalid due to runway problems

573
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:58,834
Landing is invalid due to runway problems

574
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:07,441
I will contact you soon, so please wait there for a while.

575
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:15,160
We have to go now

576
01:06:19,292 --> 01:06:20,292
We are going

577
01:06:21,888 --> 01:06:23,396
How many people?

578
01:06:23,488 --> 01:06:27,228
4 people include you

579
01:06:27,832 --> 01:06:28,379
4?

580
01:06:30,669 --> 01:06:31,403
I can't

581
01:06:31,969 --> 01:06:32,483
You sure?

582
01:06:33,016 --> 01:06:36,389
With that gasoline, we're gonna have to make it to Okinawa. Two at the most.

583
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:38,506
If you lie to me, I'll kill you.

584
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:41,326
I ain't lying.
I don't want to crash in the ocean either.

585
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:44,496
Me and one other one will have to draw lots.

586
01:06:46,326 --> 01:06:47,333
What should we do?

587
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,580
You tricked me

588
01:06:52,623 --> 01:06:54,383
I'll take the money and Yumi

589
01:06:54,749 --> 01:06:58,103
You can't betray your own people and expect to be saved.

590
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:00,116
Shut up

591
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:02,801
Me and he can do anything

592
01:07:33,260 --> 01:07:35,854
He was a fool who believed a lie.

593
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,414
What do you mean?

594
01:07:40,271 --> 01:07:41,591
Well, one less person, anyway.

595
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:44,618
I'm gonna check the plane.

596
01:08:18,306 --> 01:08:20,132
I don't know what he's doing.

597
01:08:24,780 --> 01:08:25,973
Let's go anyway.

598
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,132
Just deliver this.

599
01:08:37,714 --> 01:08:39,221
What's wrong?

600
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:43,767
Strange, we won't go to Amami

601
01:08:54,306 --> 01:08:55,279
What's this?

602
01:08:58,872 --> 01:09:02,405
You lied.

603
01:09:06,129 --> 01:09:06,796
Get away

604
01:09:07,856 --> 01:09:08,716
I'll shoot you

605
01:09:08,996 --> 01:09:09,983
Shoot me

606
01:09:10,958 --> 01:09:13,271
If I die, you'll never get off this island.

607
01:09:13,708 --> 01:09:16,081
Gasolin is fine

608
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:17,592
Come here

609
01:09:32,353 --> 01:09:34,360
Is this OK?

610
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,120
What about vaccines?

611
01:09:53,948 --> 01:09:55,495
You're so desperate to be dead to vaccines, aren't you?

612
01:10:00,856 --> 01:10:01,596
Azuma

613
01:10:34,910 --> 01:10:37,390
She broke the radar.

614
01:10:58,562 --> 01:11:01,049
Are you alright?
Where's him?

615
01:11:01,706 --> 01:11:04,106
I killed him

616
01:11:05,025 --> 01:11:06,459
Give me the postol

617
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:09,585
Let me handle this

618
01:11:24,882 --> 01:11:25,576
Are you ok?

619
01:11:26,928 --> 01:11:28,621
Are you ok?

620
01:12:52,589 --> 01:12:56,059
That's a blind spot. You can't hit it.

621
01:12:59,709 --> 01:13:02,863
You're the only one left.
I don't want to kill her.

622
01:13:03,436 --> 01:13:04,336
Put your pistol down

623
01:13:09,517 --> 01:13:11,697
I'll kill all

624
01:13:15,084 --> 01:13:15,651
Stop it

625
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:21,439
Stop it

626
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:22,859
I won't

627
01:13:23,714 --> 01:13:26,087
I'll kill all of you

628
01:13:26,294 --> 01:13:27,560
Stop shooting

629
01:13:28,434 --> 01:13:29,634
I can keep shooting

630
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:33,012
I can kill you and the nurse

631
01:13:36,224 --> 01:13:37,504
Don't kill me

632
01:14:37,466 --> 01:14:38,359
My bad

633
01:15:05,660 --> 01:15:07,967
I can't seduce you anymore.

634
01:15:09,503 --> 01:15:12,817
No worry. You won't die

635
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:27,239
Take care f this

636
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:31,413
Electeic is off

637
01:15:57,295 --> 01:15:58,729
You guys go to hell

638
01:16:34,926 --> 01:16:35,786
Asaka

639
01:16:48,817 --> 01:16:49,637
Yoshimoto

640
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:51,344
I'm glad you are alive

641
01:17:06,728 --> 01:17:07,295
How's him

642
01:17:08,308 --> 01:17:09,248
He's alright

643
01:17:16,081 --> 01:17:17,008
Hold on

644
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,239
Are you altight?

645
01:17:33,991 --> 01:17:38,844
This is Kagoshima police.
A rescue team including two doctors will arrive in 20 minutes.

646
01:17:39,781 --> 01:17:41,781
Please let us know the extent of the damage there.

647
01:17:43,993 --> 01:17:46,353
It's 3:30 , Let's go now

648
01:17:46,655 --> 01:17:47,608
There's still time to deliver the vaccine.

649
01:17:48,021 --> 01:17:48,675
But

650
01:17:53,482 --> 01:17:57,982
The doctor will be here soon.
Don't worry about us. Just get the vaccine to them.

651
01:18:14,430 --> 01:18:15,643
See you

652
01:18:16,043 --> 01:18:16,850
Take care

653
01:18:21,017 --> 01:18:22,683
See you

654
01:18:23,163 --> 01:18:24,143
See you again

655
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,120
Let's go

656
01:19:13,481 --> 01:19:16,187
Have a safe trip

657
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:35,204
If you feel sick, just use this.

658
01:19:35,731 --> 01:19:36,384
It's okay.

659
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:39,572
I'm kind of starting to like flying.

660
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:17,808
THE END

August 15, 1945

3
00:00:19,347 --> 00:00:21,316
the war is over

4
00:00:22,214 --> 00:00:27,777
Manchuria was occupied by the Soviet army and Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.

5
00:00:29,144 --> 00:00:35,184
The survivors walked south

6
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:41,373
At this time, the Manchurian people began to rob

Hoodlum Soldier Looting and Pillaging (#8)
Heitai Yakuza Godatsu

00:01:58,676 --> 00:02:06,364
Omiya and I kept walking to get back to Japan as soon as possible.

9
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:14,480
Mr.private first class solider, is it far to Shoukatong?

10
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,793
It takes 20km from here

11
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:25,488
do we go camping again?
i want to sleep with a woman

12
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,699
Omiya.Japan was lost

13
00:02:28,152 --> 00:02:33,652
Japan was lost but I didn't

14
00:02:57,316 --> 00:03:00,206
They're unlucky even though the war is over

15
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:04,261
we might get killed

16
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:08,160
I won't die

17
00:03:10,143 --> 00:03:12,729
I will go back to Japan and enjoy my life

18
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:24,511
What are you doing?

19
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:32,118
All pistols stolen

20
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:35,236
they all robbed

21
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:05,271
guerrillas did this

22
00:04:15,716 --> 00:04:17,154
He's alive

23
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:24,460
guerrillas did this?

24
00:04:34,672 --> 00:04:37,367
Omiya!  give him food

25
00:04:38,047 --> 00:04:40,195
they are our food

26
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,898
give him food

27
00:04:41,428 --> 00:04:43,576
he is our mate

28
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,777
Hold on

29
00:05:12,127 --> 00:05:15,986
Hey guys.

1.2.3.4.5

31
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:05,115
6.7.8.9.10

32
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:18,926
Damn it.
he took this alone

33
00:06:18,996 --> 00:06:20,223
Shit

34
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,623
they are Japanese

35
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,537
What are they doing?

36
00:07:12,814 --> 00:07:14,525
Who are you guys?

37
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:15,408
Come here

38
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:18,377
Hold on
What are you doing?

39
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:19,650
Come here

40
00:07:20,408 --> 00:07:22,174
Don't order us

41
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,150
We'll shoot unless you listen to me

42
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,633
Attention

43
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,469
Attention

44
00:07:32,406 --> 00:07:33,750
We are no longer solider

45
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:34,734
You dude

46
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:40,455
the war is over

47
00:07:43,698 --> 00:07:45,135
You're lair

48
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:48,219
Hold on, Omiya!

49
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:55,024
We were disarmed.
you have no right to hit us

50
00:07:55,344 --> 00:07:57,282
Mind your mouth

51
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:02,274
don't you know the information that the war is over?

52
00:08:02,579 --> 00:08:06,672
You are stupid.
it's a conspiracy done by someone

53
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:11,955
We, the Kwantung Army, will never surrender.

54
00:08:12,213 --> 00:08:16,174
I will fight here until everyone dies

55
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,342
Do it on your own

56
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:23,944
You bastard!

57
00:08:24,498 --> 00:08:25,709
Omiya!

58
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:28,139
lock him up

59
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,500
Get in!

60
00:09:09,727 --> 00:09:12,493
Soldiers are active

61
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:15,602
everything is as you think

62
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,969
let's investigate her

63
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,615
Look at us

64
00:09:28,176 --> 00:09:29,004
Come here

65
00:09:35,156 --> 00:09:35,812
Give me fire

66
00:10:16,188 --> 00:10:19,273
how many Japanese did you kill?

67
00:10:30,103 --> 00:10:31,283
Take off your clothes

68
00:11:20,099 --> 00:11:22,076
Omiya!

69
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,593
Omiya! You awake?

70
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:41,968
Mr.private first class solider!

71
00:11:44,483 --> 00:11:45,811
It's dirty

72
00:11:49,717 --> 00:11:51,139
We are here

73
00:11:53,811 --> 00:11:54,951
What will happen to us?

74
00:11:55,904 --> 00:11:59,084
They will kill us?

75
00:12:00,374 --> 00:12:01,889
It might be so

76
00:12:27,294 --> 00:12:30,216
how many men have you slept with?

77
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,756

78
00:12:58,849 --> 00:12:59,592

81
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:11,999
tell me

82
00:13:15,382 --> 00:13:16,687
You don't feel hurt?

83
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,375
You have a nice figure

84
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,039
Take off your clothes

85
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:41,242
she is stubborn

86
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,867
She is strong

87
00:13:46,281 --> 00:13:47,125
What should we do?

88
00:13:49,024 --> 00:13:50,242
Well

89
00:14:05,258 --> 00:14:06,493
I'm starving

90
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,672
I'm starving

91
00:14:10,134 --> 00:14:12,283
Bring me meal

92
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,275

93
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,955
you will be killed by a gun

94
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,887
they don't feed us

95
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,308
Hey come in

96
00:15:19,105 --> 00:15:20,019

97
00:15:29,173 --> 00:15:30,502

98
00:15:30,728 --> 00:15:31,892
Who are you guys?

99
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,814

Bring them out

104
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,019
We have canned food.

105
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:01,832
Really?

106
00:16:04,239 --> 00:16:06,137
Oh yeah

107
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:08,668
There are many

108
00:16:10,457 --> 00:16:11,340
Sake is also here

109
00:16:16,897 --> 00:16:19,421
We can't hold all

110
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:32,251
Hey, why you don't help us

111
00:16:38,842 --> 00:16:40,600
Damn it

112
00:16:44,091 --> 00:16:48,162
They have no humanity.

113
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:57,099
Omiya!

114
00:16:58,521 --> 00:16:59,365
What's wrong?

115
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:01,115
Omiya!

116
00:17:28,122 --> 00:17:29,060
Stop

117
00:17:50,682 --> 00:17:51,370
Omiya!

118
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,442
I will shoot you if you shoot her

119
00:18:06,984 --> 00:18:09,820
Don't shoot

120
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,556
Omiya!

121
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,166
Let's take a rest here

122
00:19:46,991 --> 00:19:48,882
Be careful

123
00:20:10,472 --> 00:20:12,527
Let's take a rest here

124
00:20:51,504 --> 00:20:53,598
Drink water

125
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,442
Drink water

126
00:21:05,116 --> 00:21:06,327
She's nice

127
00:21:16,905 --> 00:21:18,022
She got hurt

128
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:20,077
Does it hurt?

129
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,825
Let her take a rest

130
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,442
Lie down

131
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:57,535
I found out. She wanna go to toilet

132
00:22:00,048 --> 00:22:02,649
wanna go to toilet?

133
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,696
Let's go

134
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:11,168
Omiya!

135
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:14,692
I wanna go too

136
00:22:32,682 --> 00:22:34,268
Here bring me back my memory

137
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,883
It smells good

138
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,012
I will go to watch

139
00:24:05,884 --> 00:24:08,587
She's run away

140
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,573
I helped her, but she didn't thank to me

141
00:24:47,992 --> 00:24:49,297
Mr.private first class solider!

142
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:53,846
Where's her?

143
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:57,143
She's gone

144
00:24:57,713 --> 00:25:01,275
She's left this

145
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:16,106
What should I do about this baby

146
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,325
Leave him here

147
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,364
But

148
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:24,192
Leave him here.
We can't take care of him

149
00:25:24,512 --> 00:25:26,317
But I can't leave

150
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:30,083
We don't know he is Japanese or Manganese

151
00:25:35,053 --> 00:25:36,131
He's human

152
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,313
Listen, he will be in danger if he is with us

153
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,104
Do whatever you want.

154
00:26:21,116 --> 00:26:22,421
Mr.private first class solider

155
00:26:51,001 --> 00:26:55,485
She left him. It's none of our business

156
00:26:59,386 --> 00:27:01,589
He's going to die if we leave him

157
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:12,792
Omiya!

158
00:27:18,488 --> 00:27:19,183
Bring him

159
00:27:30,246 --> 00:27:33,090
We'll take you

160
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:48,212
Mr.private first class solider!
He looks happy

161
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:52,868
You're lucky

162
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,163
Don't be shy

163
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:13,202
you are good at taking care of baby

164
00:29:13,257 --> 00:29:15,069
Don't worry

165
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:16,765
Leave it to me

166
00:29:18,741 --> 00:29:19,858
You like him now

167
00:29:23,332 --> 00:29:25,074
Hey baby

168
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,222
Omiya!

169
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,113
we have to survive

170
00:29:33,982 --> 00:29:35,162
For him too

171
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,904
Let's go back to Japan and live together

172
00:29:42,762 --> 00:29:43,379

173
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:49,254
I'm excited

174
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,980
I will give you a ride on the Sumida River boat in Tokyo.

175
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,175
Omiya!
Come here

176
00:30:12,761 --> 00:30:13,480
Omiya!

177
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:18,160
What's wrong?

178
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:27,101
Listen,don't get excited yet.
From now on we will have a hard time

179
00:30:28,358 --> 00:30:35,761
If we deviate on the way, let's meet at SOUKATONG

180
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:42,659
You don't have to worry

181
00:30:44,128 --> 00:30:46,925
don't talk cold like that

182
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:48,941
He's crying

183
00:30:51,322 --> 00:30:51,986
What happen?

184
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:54,994
He needs boob

185
00:30:57,529 --> 00:30:59,092
You are stupid

186
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:02,506
He needs to piss?

187
00:31:07,827 --> 00:31:08,741
Shit

188
00:31:14,046 --> 00:31:15,952
Good boy

189
00:31:21,382 --> 00:31:22,663
What's this?

190
00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:26,921
Fukagawago?

191
00:31:30,921 --> 00:31:34,125
He is Japanese, not Manchu.

192
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:38,500
i don't care about his nationality.
He is our baby

193
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:41,896
yes that's right

194
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,040
Omiya!

195
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:57,077
What's wrong?

196
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,319
Are you alone?

197
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:01,132
Where is Mr.private first class solider?

198
00:34:23,706 --> 00:34:24,604
Mr.private first class solider

199
00:34:28,003 --> 00:34:29,073
Mr.private first class solider

200
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,297
we are the national liberation army

201
00:34:39,984 --> 00:34:40,773
What is your name?

202
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,203
Arita

203
00:34:43,023 --> 00:34:44,672
Why you are here?

204
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:50,095
I was on the way to Sokatong

205
00:34:50,306 --> 00:34:51,876
It's a different direction

206
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:54,911
I lost my way

207
00:34:55,418 --> 00:34:56,887
don't lie

208
00:34:57,582 --> 00:34:58,918
I'm not lying

209
00:34:59,879 --> 00:35:01,911
Don't trick me

210
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:06,092
where did you hide your luggage?

211
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:08,608
My luggage??

212
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:09,436
Yes

213
00:35:10,217 --> 00:35:10,733
What luggage?

214
00:35:11,882 --> 00:35:12,936
Don't pretend you don't know

215
00:35:14,126 --> 00:35:16,017
if you don't tell me i will kill you

216
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:19,142
Tell me

217
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:26,056
The Japanese around here must be our enemies.

218
00:35:26,868 --> 00:35:28,845
where did you hide your luggage?

219
00:35:36,522 --> 00:35:37,272
That...

220
00:35:37,545 --> 00:35:39,967
Definitely you know, tell me

221
00:35:41,123 --> 00:35:41,694
Tell me

222
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:47,228
I can't tell

223
00:35:49,017 --> 00:35:54,072
That $100,000 is our precious war fund.

224
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:55,127
Tell me

225
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:57,063
$100,000

226
00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:01,929
Tell me

227
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,007
Tell me

228
00:36:08,492 --> 00:36:09,149
Hold on

229
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:17,602
If you kill me, you don't know where the $100,000 is

230
00:36:18,463 --> 00:36:19,237
Let him go

231
00:37:01,691 --> 00:37:04,886
I wish I could have Omiya here

232
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:17,035
Hello

233
00:37:24,574 --> 00:37:25,270
What?

234
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,653
You want dollar?

235
00:37:46,911 --> 00:37:48,864
Yes $100,000

236
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,536
I'll give you

237
00:37:53,106 --> 00:37:53,676
Really?

238
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,965
I only tell you the place

239
00:37:58,637 --> 00:37:59,723
$100,000

240
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,996
Let me go

241
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:21,106
Come

242
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:26,004
Here

243
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,823
To the right

244
00:39:46,297 --> 00:39:49,422
I am your mate

245
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,291
He is Kato UNIT who abandoned us

246
00:40:34,909 --> 00:40:36,409
he is the man in charge of weapons

247
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,885
So Matsukawa should be here

248
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,798
I found him

249
00:41:06,031 --> 00:41:07,038
Damn it

250
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,823
kato leader is here

251
00:41:23,593 --> 00:41:28,234
It's strange that Matsukawa isn't here

252
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:32,281
the unit is destroyed.
But he is not here

253
00:43:31,614 --> 00:43:34,676
I'm tired

254
00:43:37,231 --> 00:43:38,106
Drink this

255
00:43:40,606 --> 00:43:42,402
You bastard!

256
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:53,647
Come here

257
00:43:58,947 --> 00:44:01,314
i hate you guys

258
00:44:14,736 --> 00:44:16,025
You bastard!

259
00:44:46,730 --> 00:44:48,011
You bastard!

260
00:44:54,546 --> 00:44:55,921
Oh my god

261
00:45:33,643 --> 00:45:35,714
Keep him quiet

262
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:37,229
They will kill us if they find us

263
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:26,249
No problem

264
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:40,906
Let's go

265
00:47:11,469 --> 00:47:12,508
Is he dead?

266
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,587
You guys

267
00:47:20,954 --> 00:47:22,353
He's dead

268
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:34,498
Hold on

269
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:37,490
I'll beat you

270
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:48,884
Fuck you

271
00:47:58,605 --> 00:48:00,886
You guys should go to hell

272
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:14,343
You are alive

273
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:15,679
baby

274
00:48:27,669 --> 00:48:28,778
Wait

275
00:48:30,013 --> 00:48:32,294
I'll kill you

276
00:48:32,817 --> 00:48:34,013
Don't shoot us

277
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,888
i will give you gold coins

278
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:39,091
gold coins?

279
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:45,098
I'll give you half of the $100,000 gold coin

280
00:48:46,824 --> 00:48:47,629
Don't shoot us

281
00:48:49,903 --> 00:48:51,551
What's the gold coins?

282
00:48:53,895 --> 00:48:58,723
We found it. We were going to bring it back to Japan.

283
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:01,367
But Matsukawa found it

284
00:49:03,054 --> 00:49:04,039
Matsukawa?

285
00:49:04,828 --> 00:49:11,390
we used to work in his unit

286
00:49:12,554 --> 00:49:19,679
He used the Kato Unit to imprison us in the mountains.

287
00:49:21,601 --> 00:49:22,632
you don't have that money right now

288
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:23,999
we're sure to get them back

289
00:49:24,351 --> 00:49:25,851
We'll find him

290
00:49:26,452 --> 00:49:27,718
I can't count on you

291
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:33,257
Give me what you have now

292
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:37,023
Give me

293
00:49:55,268 --> 00:49:56,244
Thank you

294
00:49:57,838 --> 00:49:58,916
See you

295
00:50:00,776 --> 00:50:01,854
Damn it

296
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:04,213
Take care

297
00:50:10,853 --> 00:50:13,346
Oh my god

298
00:50:13,799 --> 00:50:15,682
Where's Milk?

299
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:19,823
The Milk is missing

300
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,030
Omiya!

301
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:50,866
Omiya!

302
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:04,962
Omiya!

303
00:51:06,298 --> 00:51:07,508
Where are you?

304
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:30,884
Japanese?

305
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,291
Shoot him

306
00:52:31,372 --> 00:52:33,567
I'm not your enemy.
Throw out your pistol

307
00:52:35,088 --> 00:52:37,744
You're very strong.
I have something to ask you,

308
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:41,432
Can you come with me?

309
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:43,084
To where?

310
00:52:44,147 --> 00:52:45,592
There are Sake and women

311
00:52:46,795 --> 00:52:48,279
There is very nice place

312
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,261
There is milk too

313
00:52:54,722 --> 00:52:57,042
You should take off your Japanese soldier's clothes.

314
00:52:58,019 --> 00:52:59,261
you should change your clothes

315
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:43,716
please wait here for a while

316
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:41,108
Come

317
00:56:02,973 --> 00:56:05,122
Don't cry

318
00:56:16,517 --> 00:56:17,384
Wait

319
00:56:19,946 --> 00:56:20,517
Wait

320
00:56:24,322 --> 00:56:27,337
I have something to ask you, so please come right away.

321
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,105
He's my boss

322
00:56:45,038 --> 00:56:46,366
What can I do for you?

323
00:57:24,062 --> 00:57:27,663
Can you kill him?

324
00:57:33,767 --> 00:57:36,134
i will give you everything you want

325
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:48,071
I can't help you

326
00:57:48,634 --> 00:57:50,642
My boss can do what he wants

327
00:57:55,282 --> 00:57:55,899
Really?

328
00:57:56,235 --> 00:57:57,313
He can't lie

329
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:03,368
There is a Japanese named Arita

330
00:58:06,169 --> 00:58:08,466
he is captured by the liberation army.
Can you help him out?

331
00:58:08,677 --> 00:58:09,388
It's easy

332
00:58:09,848 --> 00:58:13,036
He's associated with the Straight Army and the Liberation Army

333
00:58:14,231 --> 00:58:15,091
So can you?

334
00:58:19,134 --> 00:58:20,821
I'll give you this

335
00:58:21,978 --> 00:58:23,095
I don't need it

336
00:58:38,997 --> 00:58:40,465
Damn it

337
00:58:59,961 --> 00:59:00,524
Bet it

338
00:59:33,368 --> 00:59:37,587
You bastard!
you were cheating

339
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:41,649
If it's Japanese rules you are being killed

340
00:59:42,978 --> 00:59:44,048
Get out!

341
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:28,163
Good baby

342
01:01:14,432 --> 01:01:17,541
What? Was he kidnapped?

343
01:01:42,183 --> 01:01:45,769
You sure you don't know about the $100,000?

344
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:47,354
I don't know

345
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:49,503
Don't pretend you don't know

346
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:54,099
I don't know at all

347

01:05:09,456 --> 01:05:10,464
Liberation Army

368
01:05:13,956 --> 01:05:15,081

00:00:14,965 --> 00:00:24,441
Adultery / Furin (1965)

3
00:00:25,867 --> 00:00:31,640
Our ancestors didn't used to have a unit of husband and wife.

4
00:00:32,914 --> 00:00:41,429
When they felt like each other, they enjoyed having fun together

5
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:44,139
They resolved their sexual arousal.

6
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,780
But world population had been increasing

7
00:00:49,178 --> 00:00:57,897
But the protection of private property and religion created a taboo on sex.

8
00:00:58,709 --> 00:01:01,264
That's how we got the unit of husband and wife.

9
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:10,092
People began to have sex to adapt to a demanding social life

10
00:01:12,093 --> 00:01:16,476
Every human being has sexual desires.

11
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:24,507
But I wonder if it's morally just to have sex only in the context of a married couple.

12
00:01:26,312 --> 00:01:34,819
It's beautiful to have sex without thinking about the marital relationship.

13
00:01:36,254 --> 00:01:41,098
Marital sex is as boring as livestock.

14
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:47,434
People are solemn about sex.

15
00:01:48,661 --> 00:02:02,504
As a result, the once energetic young man becomes a boring father in the home

16
00:02:05,883 --> 00:02:09,453
Therefore I really hate a unit of husband and wife.

17
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:15,750
This woman visit me twice a week,She knows about what I think

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,836
She comes Tue and Friday these day, and She goes back in home at Omori at 8pm

19
00:02:26,582 --> 00:02:27,051
Hi

20
00:02:27,558 --> 00:02:28,480
Welcome home

21
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:30,871
Hello

22
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:47,228
I got a call for you at 3 pm from Sato,Kobunsha

23
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:49,361
About bank?

24
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,790
He told me to visit you 1 pm tomorrow

25
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,174
Wanna have a meal?

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,095
Yeah

27
00:03:08,869 --> 00:03:11,415
I cooked your favorite dish, Tonpoloo

28
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:28,773
Want beers?

29
00:03:29,046 --> 00:03:31,679
I have a work, so I won't drink

30
00:03:31,827 --> 00:03:34,749
I'm sorry.
I've already prepared it

31
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,500
What's wrong about your ring?

32
00:03:44,274 --> 00:03:46,813
My father bought it for me

33
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:49,243
It looks like engagement ring

34
00:03:49,764 --> 00:03:52,296
No one wear it in their right finger

35
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:55,975
It must wear in their left middle finger

36
00:03:56,163 --> 00:03:58,764
Oh I see

37
00:03:59,383 --> 00:04:02,250
I was asked about match making last night

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,633
I was not into it.
So my father got angry with me

39
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:12,662
But I think your mother worries about you

40
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:19,263
My mother only obeys my father, so she is on my side.

41
00:04:20,584 --> 00:04:23,771
So I feel relieved now

42
00:04:26,998 --> 00:04:29,412
She wanna get married with me?

43
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:36,177
No way.
All the women I had relations with ran away in disgust at me.

44
00:04:37,114 --> 00:04:41,888
But at the time I was....

45
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:47,508
Let's get married with me

46
00:04:48,227 --> 00:04:50,336
So Can I?

47
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:52,063
Seiko

48
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:16,055
You really get married with me?

49
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,595
I told it by mistake

50
00:05:25,071 --> 00:05:26,649
I regret it

51
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,378
At the time I found her old-fashioned and charming.

52
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:40,269
I just wanted to have sex with her once

53
00:05:45,607 --> 00:05:48,896
Can you meet my father once?

54
00:05:52,568 --> 00:05:55,123
Or shall I bring him to here one day?

55
00:05:58,046 --> 00:06:00,030
I'll visit him some day

56
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:08,483
I broke dish

57
00:06:17,437 --> 00:06:21,702
I've been avoiding her for two months since that day.

58
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:26,452
I thought she would run away from me.

59
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:31,373
That day I won the Sexual Aesthetics Newcomer of the Year award.

60
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:40,006
Congratulation

61
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:43,467
Thanks

62
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:47,092
I read this

63
00:06:48,576 --> 00:06:51,435
Tell me what you think about this book

64
00:06:51,717 --> 00:06:56,029
What I thought?
I feel misters

65
00:06:56,544 --> 00:06:59,232
I wonder why you late about marriage

66
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:04,271
Perhaps my parents were the cause of it.

67
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:05,607
Your parents ?

68
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:09,341
My mother was fed up with my father's affairs.

69
00:07:10,286 --> 00:07:13,325
So they don't get along well

70
00:07:13,536 --> 00:07:19,216
But she have to have sex with him because they are husband and wife

71
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:24,404
I used to despise them as children for being like cattle.

72
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,700
That's the reason why

73
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,201
I feel sorry

74
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:37,516
i want to fix your mind

75
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:41,422
It's impossible to fix it

76
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,018
I think I can

77
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:49,721
I want to help you who have an unhappy way of thinking

78
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,667
you should use a cutter

79
00:08:00,106 --> 00:08:02,372
I lost it

80
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,702
You should go home

81
00:08:27,342 --> 00:08:28,725
Don't worry

82
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,623
But

83
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:47,303
You should change your socks every day

84
00:08:47,452 --> 00:08:48,882
I know

85
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:23,876
She left this

86
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:30,700
You are careless

87
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,559
Oh you

88
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:39,176
I thought the dry cleaner came

89
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:42,356
They come late night?

90
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,192
It's been a while.
Come in

91
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,317
this room is very nice

92
00:09:50,434 --> 00:09:51,270
Why you say that?

93
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:57,106
You won the Rookie of the Year award, so you're popular with the media.

94
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:00,598
No way.
I sometimes work as a translator

95
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:04,833
This room is very nice and this sofa is also nice.

96
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:06,825
This is the sofa in my country house

97
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:10,380
I got this because my grandfather died

98
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,247
But you look good.
I wonder if I marry you

99
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:17,224
I'm kidding

100
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:20,825
Actually I'm in trouble with being proposed

101
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:23,263
He's UPS reporter

102
00:10:24,411 --> 00:10:25,318
He's American?

103
00:10:26,474 --> 00:10:28,818
He's sent to Vietnam now

104
00:10:29,573 --> 00:10:31,041
Look at his photo

105
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:36,464
Are you surprised?

106
00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:42,707
I think forefingers like your figure

107
00:10:44,424 --> 00:10:45,103
How old is he?

108
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,470
He's 29

109
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:48,502
He's same age with me

110
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,916
I am amazed that you have an international marriage.

111
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,822
i haven't decided that yet

112
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:56,174
So I'm here to talk with you about that

113
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:57,892
i decided the answer

114
00:10:59,268 --> 00:11:03,971
I know what's on your mind.
i read your novel,aesthetics of sex yesterday

115
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:11,174
I think the novel is written from a man's point of view.

116
00:11:12,177 --> 00:11:12,974
Why?

117
00:11:13,099 --> 00:11:15,529
Today's society is male-dominated.

118
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:20,677
Women were despised if they asked for sex

119
00:11:21,021 --> 00:11:24,091
don't worry about people like that

120
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:27,418
Sexual experience has nothing to do with human nature.

121
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,865
I think the experience of sex should be more respected

122
00:11:33,597 --> 00:11:39,175
See?
Experience is preferred in any workplace.

123
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,175
I think it's very bad for a woman to become a wife without having had sex.

124
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:49,097
I think it's worth more without virginity

125
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:54,863
I think it's very prejudiced to be obsessed with virginity

126
00:11:56,365 --> 00:11:59,748
I wish the men of the world were like you.

127
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:06,912
men are egoists.
they force women to do things

128
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,623
That's right

129
00:12:45,568 --> 00:12:47,756
There seems to be a fire nearby

130
00:12:54,063 --> 00:12:56,235
Oh there's a fire

131
00:12:57,102 --> 00:12:58,266
It's very close

132
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:00,188
Where?

133
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,673
I'm sorry but it's beautiful

134
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:22,940
No

135
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:27,885
you just empathized with me

136
00:13:28,686 --> 00:13:31,608
Yes I did, but I can't

137
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,210
Why?

138
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,725
I’m on my period today

139
00:13:41,177 --> 00:13:42,013
Trust me

140
00:14:06,951 --> 00:14:07,748
No

141
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,880
No

142
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,397
You can't

143
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:44,101
A new sensation hit me in the dark waves

144
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:50,601
Exactly it was a stone like a small jewel

145
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,875
I can't live without her

146
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,068
Seiko seems to be back

147
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,553
Oh I see

148
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,822
Ask her

149
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:11,955
i don't want her to hate me

150
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:13,627
Ask her

151
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:17,899
Seiko

152
00:15:18,945 --> 00:15:21,070
Can you come?

153
00:15:21,727 --> 00:15:24,867
Have you decided a date for Sabori-san and your father to meet?

154
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,274
Not really

155
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:29,461
We asked you about it

156
00:15:32,696 --> 00:15:35,055
He misunderstands that i don't care about you

157
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,360
It's not your fault

158
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,040
I read his book so I know what he thinks

159
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,641
he doesn't want to get married

160
00:15:47,452 --> 00:15:48,897
Is that so?

161
00:15:49,819 --> 00:15:51,280
It must be

162
00:15:52,226 --> 00:15:57,804
He said couple sex is the same as livestock sex

163
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:05,161
He thinks it's better if we don't get married and get comfortable with each other.

164
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:13,260
you have to care what people think

165
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:19,081
Having sex without getting married is like an animal

166
00:16:20,557 --> 00:16:23,987
i feel so ashamed of you

167
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:28,620
you guys think about us a little more

168
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:33,075
Don't worry I will definitely marry him

169
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:38,679
Since that day, she has come to stay at my house from time to time.

170
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:43,780
She works for a magazine, so I don't have time to see her outside.

171
00:16:43,913 --> 00:16:46,366
there are economic reasons too

172
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:00,392
I'm going out

173
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,424
It's early

174
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:04,713
I'm busy today

175
00:17:08,254 --> 00:17:09,762
Please warm up the fried egg and eat it

176
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:16,535
Can I go back after 9pm?

177
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,844
It's late

178
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,766
She's going to see you today

179
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:25,797
Oh Tuesday..

180
00:17:26,399 --> 00:17:28,157
don't fall asleep.
See you

181
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,020
This is Maki's

182
00:18:41,216 --> 00:18:44,528
This is too tidy up

183
00:18:50,226 --> 00:18:52,882
Seiko might find out

184
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:43,895
Hi

185
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:46,153
I'm sorry I'm late

186
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,926
There was a demo on the way

187
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,317
You dressed up.
Did you go to match making?

188
00:19:52,644 --> 00:19:54,840
There was a tea party

189
00:19:55,138 --> 00:19:57,184
I thought you had gone on a blind date.

190
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:04,856
I decided to take a tea lesson from tomorrow.

191
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,516
Why?

192
00:20:07,836 --> 00:20:10,094
I thought I had better have a job in hand.

193
00:20:10,422 --> 00:20:11,414
You have a job in hand?

194
00:20:12,872 --> 00:20:13,474
I decided

195
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:15,779
You'll leave your home?

196
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,763
Originally I don't want to stay at home

197
00:20:21,058 --> 00:20:24,410
I think you'd better not offend your father

198
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:26,589
It can't be helped

199
00:20:50,437 --> 00:20:55,132
Here are ginkgo nuts and baking powder. What kind of dish did you make?

200
00:20:58,113 --> 00:21:02,300
I wanted to make hotcakes

201
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:04,472
don't lie

202
00:21:06,371 --> 00:21:11,058
You intentionally soiled the dishes you washed again.

203
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:20,376
Someone is using my red chopsticks, so I'll take another one.

204
00:21:21,918 --> 00:21:24,926
don't worry i won't ask you anything

205
00:21:26,246 --> 00:21:30,613
It makes me sad when you cheat

206
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,120
She finds out everything

207
00:21:40,386 --> 00:21:43,472
my plan failed

208
00:21:44,863 --> 00:21:48,832
Wait..Maki might be..

209
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:53,863
she may be planning something

210
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:12,146
That's what I thought

211
00:22:13,099 --> 00:22:19,646
Maki is trying to make his presence known to SEIKO

212
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:27,269
What's wrong?

213
00:22:27,425 --> 00:22:31,089
Even though you're an adult now, you call yourself a child

214
00:22:32,709 --> 00:22:34,232
don't do tricks

215
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:36,068
What?

216
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,506
Don't pretend you don't know

217
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,084
What's wrong about this handkerchief?

218
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:40,427
I know this is yours

219
00:22:41,959 --> 00:22:44,045
This is not mine

220
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,505
It has the initial S

221
00:22:47,755 --> 00:22:48,770
My initial is M

222
00:22:50,153 --> 00:22:51,130
I see

223
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:54,409
it belongs to your other woman,right?

224
00:22:55,862 --> 00:23:01,956
Your other woman is doing all sorts of tricks

225
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:09,465
All the cabbage that I put in the refrigerator is cut.

226
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,975
it is cut in two with a kitchen knife

227
00:23:14,366 --> 00:23:15,569
I felt scary

228
00:23:17,366 --> 00:23:19,647
I never told you about it

229
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:16,729
why do you sometimes cut cabbage in two?

230
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,611
it rots quickly

231
00:24:18,885 --> 00:24:22,385
You're too sensitive.
This is my way

232
00:24:22,858 --> 00:24:24,147
Your way?

233
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:27,303
I usually take cabbage leaves and cut them

234
00:24:27,881 --> 00:24:33,717
I learned how to cook from the north, so I cut it like this

235
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:41,065
I can't prepare the dish unless I cut the cabbage in two.

236
00:24:42,393 --> 00:24:45,745
I won't cut in two if you don't like

237
00:24:46,057 --> 00:24:49,714
Please stop cutting the cabbage because it will get old.

238
00:24:51,302 --> 00:24:51,935
Ok

239
00:24:57,177 --> 00:25:01,380
Maki seems to have misunderstood about cabbage.

240
00:26:00,242 --> 00:26:02,476
Shall we have a bath?

241
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:07,570
I wanna stay here to listen to the music

242
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,396
The bath is ready
Let's get in together

243
00:27:49,797 --> 00:27:50,836
Who is it?

244
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:05,743
What's wrong?
Today is not..

245
00:28:21,455 --> 00:28:23,830
I'm about to take a bath

246
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:26,955
I'm tired from staying up all night translating

247
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:41,249
This is my father's paper knife.
I'm here to give you this

248
00:28:42,475 --> 00:28:47,413
Please use these scissors for your work as well.

249
00:28:49,459 --> 00:28:53,342
You didn't bother to bring it in the rain.

250
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,889
Anything else?

251
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:01,310
I need to talk with you something

252
00:29:01,748 --> 00:29:03,435
What?

253
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:05,209
Next time ok

254
00:29:05,234 --> 00:29:07,592
Tell me now

255
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:12,174
I got pregnant

256
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:15,424
You're kidding

257
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,690
i don't care if you don't believe

258
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,479
You'll find out later

259
00:29:21,647 --> 00:29:23,280
What the hell?

260
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,756
are you going to have a baby?

261
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:28,069
Sure

262
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:31,505
I want to have your baby

263
00:29:40,288 --> 00:29:41,030
Who?

264
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:45,815
dry cleaner?

265
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,385
Female?

266
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:49,572
Old woman

267
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,054
Wash my body

268
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:02,601
Damn it.
Seiko got pregnant

269
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:06,406
We'll have a baby

270
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:11,455
I must stop her

271
00:30:17,142 --> 00:30:22,783
Seiko eventually decided to have an abortion.

272
00:30:23,893 --> 00:30:27,174
She thought it was wrong to have a child without being married yet.

273
00:30:28,307 --> 00:30:31,549
I think she was emotional then

274
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:53,364
We've done.
It's okay to come back in 2 hours

275
00:32:05,061 --> 00:32:08,967
Another woman always comes after I leave

276
00:32:12,141 --> 00:32:17,360
i got terrible.
what are you going to do?

277
00:32:19,001 --> 00:32:22,063
I want to know

278
00:32:23,712 --> 00:32:26,821
Tell me you hate me

279
00:32:31,314 --> 00:32:36,439
I took the liberty of having a date with you.

280
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:41,690
I'm so sad.
I feel like going to die

281
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:48,237
I can't go home

282
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:55,166
My parents wonder why you don't come to my house

283
00:32:57,053 --> 00:33:00,327
I have a very bad reputation because I stay home without getting married.

284
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:04,116
my parents want me and you to live together

285
00:33:06,126 --> 00:33:09,313
But I don't wanna force you about it

286
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:13,782
i feel like killing myself

287
00:33:17,446 --> 00:33:20,650
So Tell me you hate me

288
00:33:21,212 --> 00:33:24,157
What if I tell you it?

289
00:33:25,292 --> 00:33:27,660
do you have the chance to marry another man?

290
00:33:28,972 --> 00:33:32,495
No way.
I don't have

291
00:33:33,183 --> 00:33:39,574
If you tell me clearly that you don't like me, I can make up my mind

292
00:33:40,884 --> 00:33:42,743
I don't hate you

293
00:33:43,594 --> 00:33:44,243
Lair

294
00:33:45,868 --> 00:33:49,548
You're suspicious.
why don't you believe me?

295
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:58,348
because you won't live with me

296
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:08,165
Ok..then, let's live together

297
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:27,801
To be honest,I have to compensate SEIKO for something.

298
00:34:29,434 --> 00:34:32,122
About The abortion this afternoon.

299
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:37,145
But I definitely can't get married with her

300
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,007
We won't get married for sure, ok?

301
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:46,866
We live like siblings

302
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:49,491
We're not husband and wife

303
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:52,640
But we live together at a house

304
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:55,499
Yes, that's what you want,right?

305
00:35:26,105 --> 00:35:28,934
Are you Sabori?
I'm Takayama

306
00:35:29,621 --> 00:35:30,941
Thanks for taking care of my daughter

307
00:35:31,691 --> 00:35:35,965
Seiko told me about that.
We all family feel at ease

308
00:35:36,488 --> 00:35:37,355
Thank you

309
00:35:38,648 --> 00:35:41,414
Thank you in advance

310
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,484
But we won't get married

311
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:50,797
In short, we pretend to be husband and wife

312
00:35:52,875 --> 00:35:56,265
I see.
Thanks for understand me

313
00:36:00,023 --> 00:36:00,726
You are lair

314
00:36:00,953 --> 00:36:01,476
Why?

315
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:05,164
You told me you hated a unit of husband and wife

316
00:36:05,742 --> 00:36:07,195
But you made a promise with her

317
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:11,070
Don't get me wrong.
We just live together

318
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:14,562
You listened to our conversation just before

319
00:36:15,234 --> 00:36:18,609
It's husband and wife if you live together

320
00:36:19,914 --> 00:36:21,570
The aesthetics of sex have been corrupted.

321
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:23,742
You're loser

322
00:36:24,468 --> 00:36:28,179
Am I? no way.
I had no choice but...

323
00:36:28,577 --> 00:36:29,984
Don't give me excuses.

324
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:32,164
I don't give you excuses.

325
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:34,615
You will get to know later

326
00:36:35,178 --> 00:36:37,568
Don't be upset

327
00:36:38,638 --> 00:36:39,849
I hate lair

328
00:36:41,781 --> 00:36:42,469
Maki

329
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:53,136
I'm going home

330
00:37:01,412 --> 00:37:05,232
I sold the apartment, and bought a house in suburb

331
00:37:06,068 --> 00:37:10,763
It's convenience for me if there are many rooms

332
00:37:14,058 --> 00:37:16,394
Seiko sleep downstairs

333
00:37:17,058 --> 00:37:20,879
I use upstairs for my work too

334
00:37:22,017 --> 00:37:24,290
You are still working

335
00:37:24,532 --> 00:37:26,845
Please take a break

336
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,433
What's that?

337
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:37,925
I put on this because I had to address to neighbors

338
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:48,362
Hi

339
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:51,747
Oh it's me

340
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,614
How's your new house?

341
00:37:56,278 --> 00:37:57,294
It's boring

342
00:37:58,270 --> 00:37:59,184
Really

343
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:02,636
By the way, shall we meet tomorrow?

344
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:04,847
Sorry, I'm busy

345
00:38:09,157 --> 00:38:11,040
I need to think myself

346
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:14,884
No.
See you

347
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:23,864
Maki refused to meet me for a week,
but I end up meeting her

348
00:38:27,967 --> 00:38:30,616
I can't sleep well these days

349
00:38:31,678 --> 00:38:33,655
I see bad dreams

350
00:38:34,592 --> 00:38:38,405
I work too hard and eat ramen outside

351
00:38:39,756 --> 00:38:42,006
and I'm lonely at home

352
00:38:43,387 --> 00:38:45,074
I feel like killing myself

353
00:38:46,684 --> 00:38:50,043
I imagine you guys enjoy your life

354
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,270
I feel lonely

355
00:38:53,504 --> 00:38:56,543
In the end, I love you

356
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,223
He sends you letters?

357
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,262
I got.
He write sweet words

358
00:39:05,018 --> 00:39:07,792
But I really miss you

359
00:39:08,838 --> 00:39:13,135
I want to smell you and hear your voice

360
00:39:13,948 --> 00:39:15,612
I wanna feel you

361
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:25,965
How about meeting with us once?

362
00:39:27,113 --> 00:39:30,410
we shouldn't care too much

363
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,965
We need some changes

364
00:39:35,449 --> 00:39:38,926
I had a lot of bad experiences

365
00:39:40,481 --> 00:39:44,027
I don't think I've ever had a worse experience

366
00:39:45,824 --> 00:39:48,957
She also had a lot of bad experiences too

367
00:39:50,004 --> 00:39:53,262
I think she understands me

368
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:57,464
But I worry she wanna meet me

369
00:39:58,675 --> 00:39:59,816
Leave it to me

370
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:04,191
But I don't have a wife

371
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:09,261
As I told you, We live like siblings

372
00:40:10,464 --> 00:40:13,043
I don't trust you

373
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:20,192
Anyway I will invite you later

374
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,795
I persuaded her over time.
She finally accepted it

375
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:42,011
Maki is coming at 3pm

376
00:41:06,224 --> 00:41:07,216
Ouch!

377
00:41:14,828 --> 00:41:18,140
Calm down.
Don't worry

378
00:41:48,596 --> 00:41:51,096
Seiko, you see?

379
00:41:53,850 --> 00:42:00,178
You mean, we're not husband and wife.
Don't pretend to be my wife,right?

380
00:42:13,286 --> 00:42:14,638
Come in

381
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:16,856
May I?

382
00:42:23,546 --> 00:42:30,726
Listen,
Don't show how you are great

383
00:42:31,658 --> 00:42:36,759
I know.
I'm not stupid

384
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:38,853
You're not

385
00:42:54,873 --> 00:42:56,146
I'll introduce her

386
00:42:57,857 --> 00:42:59,560
Calm down

387
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:03,368
Wipe up

388
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:13,429
I'll wipe

389
00:43:16,132 --> 00:43:18,101
You got your clothes dirty

390
00:43:18,744 --> 00:43:21,775
Don't worry

391
00:43:22,541 --> 00:43:23,705
This is cheap

392
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,342
Hold on

393
00:43:31,404 --> 00:43:34,271
It's true that you are not husband and wife.

394
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:37,448
What?

395
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:40,401
I couldn't believe it

396
00:43:41,511 --> 00:43:42,886
I found out it when I saw her ring

397
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:44,675
Ring?

398
00:43:45,476 --> 00:43:47,546
She wears on her right finger

399
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,382
her right finger?

400
00:43:52,351 --> 00:43:54,382
Yes, sure

401
00:43:55,525 --> 00:43:58,275
This might be smaller but please change

402
00:43:58,447 --> 00:44:00,025
I'll wash your clothes

403
00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:00,783
Thanks

404
00:44:00,808 --> 00:44:02,556
You had better wash your clothes quickly

405
00:44:02,626 --> 00:44:03,806
Thanks

406
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,351
Please go another room

407
00:44:19,932 --> 00:44:21,564
You have a hard time

408
00:44:22,838 --> 00:44:29,744
Yes I do.
You have hard time too

409
00:44:31,067 --> 00:44:36,918
I think Sabori have a hardest time

410
00:44:37,129 --> 00:44:40,270
Yeah, but it's his fault

411
00:44:42,294 --> 00:44:44,958
Thanks for everything

412
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,025
Come back

413
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,056
I'll wash your clothes

414
00:44:58,081 --> 00:44:59,470
I'll wash by myself

415
00:44:59,495 --> 00:45:00,744
Don't worry

416
00:45:01,421 --> 00:45:02,757
Don't worry

417
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:05,390
I don't understand this situation

418
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,640
Fake or real?

419
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,210
I think they are acting something

420
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:26,792
I see.
He can tell it's mine by looking at the initials

421
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:29,097
He's really careless

422
00:45:30,229 --> 00:45:32,150
I have another story about him

423
00:45:32,574 --> 00:45:38,160
When I visited his apartment first time, he misunderstood me as his sister and gave me a apron

424
00:45:38,823 --> 00:45:43,987
And he told me I was dry cleaner

425
00:45:49,786 --> 00:45:53,700
They were talking each other a lot during the night

426
00:45:54,849 --> 00:46:02,395
These women are eager to talk about the past.
They talk about each other's misfortunes and balance each other out.

427
00:46:03,191 --> 00:46:05,644
I’m sure they will against each other later

428
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:11,261
I have to prepare for it

429
00:46:38,361 --> 00:46:40,251
Let's take turn

430
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:46,152
You have a nice figure

431
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:49,511
You have nice skin

432
00:46:53,388 --> 00:46:54,756
What's wrong about this?

433
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,279
I was injured as a child.

434
00:46:57,334 --> 00:46:59,920
I'm sorry.
When was it?

435
00:47:00,138 --> 00:47:04,052
When I was 6.
It was serious

436
00:47:05,584 --> 00:47:08,115
Hold on.
I'll wash you

437
00:47:08,934 --> 00:47:11,965
Let's wash each other

438
00:47:24,312 --> 00:47:25,788
Are you bored?

439
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,070
You thought we talked badly about you?

440
00:47:28,484 --> 00:47:29,726
Did you finish your talking?

441
00:47:29,906 --> 00:47:34,765
Tomorrow is Sunday.
She'll stay over here tonight

442
00:47:36,473 --> 00:47:37,567
Oh no

443
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:38,700
I can't?

444
00:47:41,512 --> 00:47:43,653
I don't wanna go home

445
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:48,960
It's ok.
He always sleeps alone here

446
00:47:50,116 --> 00:47:51,937
I'd like to stay over

447
00:47:52,147 --> 00:47:53,358
Good night

448
00:47:53,567 --> 00:47:54,692
Come with me

449
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:58,582
Hold on.
You should care about me

450
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:00,996
I'll sleep downstairs from tonight

451
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:12,870
You can sleep in

452
00:48:13,096 --> 00:48:16,284
Thanks but I'll get up with you

453
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:19,057
Ok then I'll sleep in

454
00:48:19,231 --> 00:48:20,497
By 9 am

455
00:48:20,763 --> 00:48:24,817
We can sleep by 10 am

456
00:48:27,908 --> 00:48:30,518
I need to get on plane at 10 am

457
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:33,658
Oh I forgot.
I need to sleep now

458
00:48:36,031 --> 00:48:37,180
Good night

459
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,052
This is better

460
00:48:57,138 --> 00:48:58,201
This is better

461
00:49:09,589 --> 00:49:12,448
I'll be back around 20th

462
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:15,763
Maki will stay here while you are not here

463
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:19,583
We don't feel lonely each other

464
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:22,667
That might be good idea

465
00:49:22,902 --> 00:49:27,159
Can you give the front door key to her?

466
00:49:28,527 --> 00:49:29,441
OK

467
00:49:34,017 --> 00:49:34,986
Have a safe trip

468
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:42,097
I went home a day early.

469
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,332
I worried about them so

470
00:49:47,249 --> 00:49:53,561
I finished my work quickly

471
00:50:02,196 --> 00:50:02,907
What's wrong?

472
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:07,040
Saruoka.
I have to do something

473
00:50:07,493 --> 00:50:08,376
I'm leaving here

474
00:50:08,845 --> 00:50:12,649
You are strange?
Are you going to meet a women?

475
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:13,845
No way

476
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:15,851
He's bad

477
00:51:01,088 --> 00:51:02,135
Maki?

478
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:04,315
You're late

479
00:51:05,948 --> 00:51:08,518
Oh I thought you were going home tomorrow

480
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:11,569
you are very drunk

481
00:51:11,632 --> 00:51:13,241
Never mind

482
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:23,590
Did you notice anything unusual?

483
00:51:23,615 --> 00:51:25,559
My dad and mom visited me

484
00:51:26,277 --> 00:51:29,910
My dad asked me who is Maki

485
00:51:30,348 --> 00:51:32,590
I had a hard time explaining to him

486
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:37,788
Honestly you could have said she was a common-law woman

487
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:41,132
Don't say about her badly

488
00:51:42,187 --> 00:51:44,694
It seems that she and the foreigner are planning to get married

489
00:51:45,054 --> 00:51:45,640
get married?

490
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,226
those who marry are fools

491
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:50,530
Maki sleeps there

492
00:51:50,555 --> 00:51:52,086
She won't come back

493
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,508
You should change into pajamas

494
00:51:56,711 --> 00:51:58,219
It can't be helped

495
00:53:30,862 --> 00:53:32,886
Where have you been?

496
00:53:35,027 --> 00:53:36,527
You look weird

497
00:53:38,832 --> 00:53:41,105
I finally find out

498
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:45,394
You said you don't have a physical relationship with Seiko.

499
00:53:46,371 --> 00:53:50,386
But you had sex with her while I was away

500
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:54,839
But of course.
You're husband and wife

501
00:53:57,558 --> 00:54:01,511
I saw you.
Where did you go with him?

502
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:04,517
To hotel

503
00:54:06,454 --> 00:54:10,688
I just ate with him, danced with him, and drank brandy at the bar.

504
00:54:12,243 --> 00:54:14,157
Why you slapped me?

505
00:54:15,274 --> 00:54:16,321
Trust me

506
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:18,508
I'm disgusted about your lie

507
00:54:28,642 --> 00:54:29,783
why are you making rice balls?

508
00:54:30,251 --> 00:54:31,759
For Maki's lunch box

509
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:34,056
do you always make for her?

510
00:54:34,447 --> 00:54:37,080
She likes my cooking

511
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:41,501
She says she kisses and eats before she eats

512
00:54:41,697 --> 00:54:43,619
that's ridiculous

513
00:54:44,298 --> 00:54:45,899
You don't know how she feels

514
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:46,790
For what?

515
00:54:55,032 --> 00:54:56,517
I return the key to you

516
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,790
Are you coming back early today?

517
00:54:59,666 --> 00:55:01,416
I'll back home late

518
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,955
i am waiting for you

519
00:55:05,143 --> 00:55:06,073
Thanks

520
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:15,633
Do you want meal?

521
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:20,789
Come here

522
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,634
I was still awake last night when you hit Maki.

523
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,681
I felt so complicated

524
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:45,953
don't think about her anymore

525
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:12,168
I felt so sad when I held her for the first time in a long time.

526
00:56:13,903 --> 00:56:18,302
She serves me very seriously

527
00:56:19,489 --> 00:56:22,716
But I feel no desire for her.

528
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:32,317
If I don't see Maki anymore, you'll be happy.

529
00:56:37,058 --> 00:56:41,511
In that case, I won't see her anymore too

530
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:47,316
It's a pity that I won't be able to meet such a good person.

531
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:55,443
If you will allow me, I would like to be friends with her forever.

532
00:56:57,263 --> 00:56:59,700
i don't care about your relationship

533
00:57:00,786 --> 00:57:07,943
I tried to get them to get along, but this was too successful.

534
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:10,146
Hey

535
00:57:10,747 --> 00:57:11,787
That woman

536
00:57:11,997 --> 00:57:15,380
She fled from Osaka to Tokyo.

537
00:57:15,966 --> 00:57:17,990
She looks like Venus de Milo

538
00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:21,701
She's lesbian

539
00:57:22,263 --> 00:57:23,553
She's lesbian?

540
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:24,373
With who?

541
00:57:24,724 --> 00:57:25,787
Here's Madam

542
00:57:28,952 --> 00:57:34,530
She is very nervous and seems to have been deceived by many men.

543
00:57:36,421 --> 00:57:38,741
i think she has a mental problem

544
00:57:40,577 --> 00:57:41,538
Wait

545
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:45,327
Are people with neurological disorders prone to homosexuality?

546
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:49,116
Have you read Kane's book?

547
00:57:50,038 --> 00:57:55,163
According to her, people with neurological disorders are more demanding of affection.

548
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:59,538
Those people seem so devoted to men

549
00:58:00,673 --> 00:58:09,446
But Those people commit suicide when she feels uneasy about being rejected, so it's the worst.

550
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:16,020
Those people's in pain, but Those people seem to enjoy it

551
00:58:16,973 --> 00:58:22,161
But when they feel anxious just before, their demand for affection turns to women.

552
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:25,934
so they become homosexuals between women

553
00:58:28,764 --> 00:58:33,795
Is homosexuality in that case psychological?

554
00:58:34,834 --> 00:58:39,295
At first it is psychological, but gradually they come to seek physical relationships

555
00:58:43,192 --> 00:58:46,020
They bathe and eat together

556
00:58:46,544 --> 00:58:49,512
They hug each other when they sleep

557
00:59:20,255 --> 00:59:21,615
Hey wake up

558
00:59:23,326 --> 00:59:24,818
wake up

559
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:33,353
i sleep in the middle of you

560
01:00:02,905 --> 01:00:05,202
I envy what happened last night

561
01:00:06,178 --> 01:00:07,772
Why you didn't stay out tonight?

562
01:00:09,499 --> 01:00:11,921
he suddenly returned to America

563
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:14,032
He left you?

564
01:00:14,438 --> 01:00:15,141
No

565
01:00:16,157 --> 01:00:19,001
his mother seems sick

566
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,911
is she in danger?

567
01:00:22,997 --> 01:00:25,966
She said she had surgery and is doing well.

568
01:00:27,736 --> 01:00:31,111
He worries about her mom a lot

569
01:00:31,775 --> 01:00:34,400
He's mom's boy

570
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:40,490
I'll forget about him

571
01:01:15,875 --> 01:01:17,188
she is sleepwalking

572
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:18,180
No

573
01:01:20,805 --> 01:01:23,524
i hate living with you

574
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,961
I'm going home tomorrow

575
01:01:26,235 --> 01:01:27,000
Stay here

576
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:29,211
No no

577
01:01:52,643 --> 01:01:53,463
What's wrong?

578
01:01:55,354 --> 01:01:57,236
I can't sleep

579
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:00,768
Back to the room

580
01:02:02,905 --> 01:02:04,991
i believed in her

581
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,733
please believe in her too

582
01:02:08,374 --> 01:02:11,053
I get it.
Let's go back

583
01:02:20,406 --> 01:02:23,922
i will hold your hand.
i think you can sleep

584
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:29,646
come

585
01:02:30,630 --> 01:02:32,692
Why I am not happy?

586
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:38,630
I have two girlfriends, so I think I should be happier.

587
01:02:40,747 --> 01:02:45,185
i feel anxious and lonely

588
01:02:50,478 --> 01:02:53,501
I'm not lesbian with Seiko

589
01:02:53,752 --> 01:02:55,923
You don't love each other?

590
01:02:56,798 --> 01:02:58,025
What do you mean?

591
01:02:58,781 --> 01:03:02,992
I mean did you have sex with her?

592
01:03:04,015 --> 01:03:09,203
I wanted to be by your side, so I made friends with her.

593
01:03:09,942 --> 01:03:12,856
you told me to get along with her

594
01:03:13,817 --> 01:03:15,043
Yes but

595
01:03:16,299 --> 01:03:21,463
Recently, Seiko has been acting strangely.

596
01:03:21,877 --> 01:03:23,260
Because of you

597
01:03:23,666 --> 01:03:26,924
I've been having a lot of trouble lately

598
01:03:28,274 --> 01:03:32,024
Living with you makes me feel lonely

599
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:43,662
I'm taking sleeping pill everyday

600
01:03:53,493 --> 01:03:54,314
Excuse me

601
01:03:57,376 --> 01:03:58,111
Excuse me

602
01:04:06,556 --> 01:04:07,704
There's a call for you

603
01:04:08,791 --> 01:04:11,884
It's me,Maki

604
01:04:13,423 --> 01:04:16,353
Can you come to our house?

605
01:04:17,291 --> 01:04:21,604
I can't live without you

606
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,386
Please come back

607
01:04:27,284 --> 01:04:29,737
I'll listen to you

608
01:04:30,518 --> 01:04:33,620
please don't leave me

609
01:04:35,597 --> 01:04:39,495
if you don't come back i will die

610
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:43,198
Please come back

611
01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:47,027
Please come back

612
01:04:51,196 --> 01:04:54,383
Thanks.
I like you

613
01:04:55,555 --> 01:04:56,852
Please come back soon

614
01:04:59,778 --> 01:05:02,184
do you live here again?

615
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:05,653
What should I do

616
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:21,075
From tonight I will sleep on the second floor

617
01:05:21,552 --> 01:05:27,372
We have fun after Seiko goes to bed

618
01:06:09,877 --> 01:06:11,080
Were you sleeping?

619
01:06:12,534 --> 01:06:13,916
there is a thrill

620
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:21,383
Where are you,Maki?

621
01:06:22,641 --> 01:06:25,422
Maki has been gone somewhere

622
01:06:25,735 --> 01:06:26,915
Seiko

623
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:28,454
Maki?

624
01:06:29,509 --> 01:06:33,462
Maki is missing?
I will find her too

625
01:06:44,443 --> 01:06:47,529
she's on the ceiling or in the bathroom

626
01:06:50,044 --> 01:06:52,669
I hurt my back and it hurt all day

627
01:06:54,107 --> 01:06:58,450
Seiko went to her parents' house in the afternoon.

628
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:02,286
she didn't come back at night

629
01:07:03,435 --> 01:07:08,247
Seiko didn't say anything about what happened last night.

630
01:07:09,339 --> 01:07:10,925
By any chance

631
01:07:11,784 --> 01:07:14,917
what are you worried about?

632
01:07:16,354 --> 01:07:20,347
What should SEIKO-san do if something happens?

633
01:07:20,948 --> 01:07:21,831
What?

634
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,518
From police

635
01:07:33,185 --> 01:07:34,755
Hi, I'm Sabori

636
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:41,115
Oh you..where are you now?

637
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:45,622
i am in front of the station
can i go home now?

638
01:07:46,224 --> 01:07:48,872
What?
Come back soon

639
01:07:51,372 --> 01:07:53,427
We are so starving

640
01:07:55,819 --> 01:07:59,218
What?
i have to pick you up?

641
01:08:24,671 --> 01:08:25,945
Where have you been?

642
01:08:27,257 --> 01:08:34,257
you are terrible.
I was walking around Shinjuku for the sake of you two.

643
01:08:34,887 --> 01:08:38,449
you are terrible.
I won't go home

644
01:08:38,863 --> 01:08:42,012
Seiko, wait

645
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:47,652
I don't wanna go home

646
01:08:48,496 --> 01:08:49,496
Why?

647
01:08:50,762 --> 01:08:53,613
That's not my home

648
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:57,231
We moved there together

649
01:08:58,679 --> 01:09:02,242
We live together like brothers,right?

650
01:09:04,414 --> 01:09:06,820
I don't wanna go home anymore

651
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:09,867
will you go back to your parents house?

652
01:09:12,187 --> 01:09:14,640
Where are you going?

653
01:09:19,558 --> 01:09:20,378
I have a place

654
01:09:31,175 --> 01:09:36,527
i feel so guilty for this woman

655
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:42,972
she's been trained to be a seriously average wife

656
01:09:45,952 --> 01:09:50,858
We'll register tomorrow and become my legal wife

657
01:09:52,283 --> 01:09:55,517
So please come back

658
01:09:58,555 --> 01:09:59,281
You don't like?

659
01:10:05,775 --> 01:10:06,392
OK?

660
01:10:09,564 --> 01:10:14,423
You should treat me nice sometime

661
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:19,869
I know

662
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:26,207
Seiko got settle down

663
01:10:28,113 --> 01:10:31,753
But I have to settle Maki too

664
01:10:39,176 --> 01:10:39,840
Maki

665
01:10:43,605 --> 01:10:44,332
Come here

666
01:11:27,629 --> 01:11:31,317
I had to complete our lives

667
01:11:31,668 --> 01:11:38,278
I've used my stamina all night long and I'm already feeling my limit

668
01:12:16,111 --> 01:12:18,236
Seiko is taking a bath now

669
01:12:20,595 --> 01:12:24,111
she's going to relax tonight

670
01:12:26,283 --> 01:12:26,915
I see

671
01:12:31,037 --> 01:12:32,927
We can have fun for an hour

672
01:12:38,404 --> 01:12:40,131
Go downstairs

673
01:12:41,248 --> 01:12:43,388
I’m thinking something

674
01:12:51,654 --> 01:12:57,654
I should have been more interested in food than women.

675
01:12:58,771 --> 01:13:04,240
We decided to have a meal together because of Seiko's birthday.

676
01:13:08,708 --> 01:13:11,919
Are you sure to go to Paris?

677
01:13:13,755 --> 01:13:16,638
You shouldn't go.
It's boring

678
01:13:23,639 --> 01:13:28,397
this is a business trip
I also have a map of Paris in my head

679
01:13:28,593 --> 01:13:30,155
But it seems expensive

680
01:13:30,522 --> 01:13:32,257
I'll save my money

681
01:14:08,077 --> 01:14:09,804
Oh Sabori

682
01:14:11,585 --> 01:14:12,210
Hi

683
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:18,007
you are eating with beautiful women

684
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:24,811
I heard that you are married and live with a woman.

685
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,033
You are going well

686
01:14:29,931 --> 01:14:31,783
Kimono woman is your wife?

687
01:14:33,045 --> 01:14:35,139
She is your mistress?

688
01:14:38,428 --> 01:14:43,170
You have put sexual aesthetics into action.

689
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:49,553
Don't look down like that, please introduce me to a woman.

690
01:15:24,746 --> 01:15:28,379
Get up

691
01:15:29,778 --> 01:15:34,239
It seems that Maki is going to get her passport today.

692
01:15:34,458 --> 01:15:36,559
she really wants to go to Paris

693
01:15:36,973 --> 01:15:40,410
She may not come back to Japan after meeting a good man in Paris.

694
01:15:40,552 --> 01:15:41,747
Can you stop her?

695
01:15:41,772 --> 01:15:43,145
Leave her alone

696
01:15:43,348 --> 01:15:45,262
i don't care where she goes

697
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:50,043
I can't live without her

698
01:15:50,739 --> 01:15:54,012
Can you stop her?

699
01:15:54,895 --> 01:15:56,466
Please

700
01:15:56,491 --> 01:15:58,286
Can you stop her?

701
01:15:59,919 --> 01:16:01,434
Please

702
01:16:11,661 --> 01:16:17,317
I will travel for a while.
Please don't look for me

703
01:16:57,407 --> 01:17:01,790
I want to escape reality.
From Seiko and Maki too

704
01:17:02,306 --> 01:17:05,251
I want to get away from relationships.

705
01:17:08,571 --> 01:17:12,314
You have to go to the apartment tonight?

706
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:17,853
I haven't come back for a while.

707
01:17:18,407 --> 01:17:20,462
I need to tidy my room up before going to Paris

708
01:17:21,681 --> 01:17:23,650
And I have to pay for the rent

709
01:17:24,009 --> 01:17:26,360
You shouldn't go to Paris

710
01:17:31,035 --> 01:17:35,097
Please stay here tonight

711
01:17:36,175 --> 01:17:38,050
I don't wanna be alone

712
01:17:40,937 --> 01:17:44,499
And It's too late to go there

713
01:17:45,991 --> 01:17:46,999
I will stay over there

714
01:17:47,249 --> 01:17:48,085
At the apartment ?

715
01:17:49,642 --> 01:17:51,876
You stay there alone?

716
01:17:53,704 --> 01:17:55,056
Sure

717
01:17:56,626 --> 01:17:58,978
Do you doubt I stay there with Sabori?

718
01:17:59,714 --> 01:18:02,558
I don't doubt you

719
01:18:03,542 --> 01:18:06,339
That's good.
Anyway I have to go

720
01:18:06,628 --> 01:18:08,050
Wait

721
01:18:08,394 --> 01:18:10,644
I listen to you

722
01:18:10,964 --> 01:18:14,019
Don't leave me alone

723
01:18:15,165 --> 01:18:18,305
Don't worry, just one night

724
01:18:18,610 --> 01:18:20,188
I'll be back tomorrow morning

725
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:25,071
I can't sleep without you

726
01:18:25,407 --> 01:18:28,657
Please Maki

727
01:18:30,413 --> 01:18:32,171
What can I do...

728
01:18:37,895 --> 01:18:42,426
I'll give you my sleeping pills.
Take 2 tablets

729
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:52,321
I'll be back tomorrow morning

730
01:19:13,047 --> 01:19:13,938
I'm back

731
01:19:37,517 --> 01:19:40,533
To Sabori,Maki..Good bye

732
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:44,181
Seiko

733
01:19:48,196 --> 01:19:49,220
Seiko

734
01:19:50,978 --> 01:19:52,759
Seiko

735
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:54,790
I'm Maki

736
01:19:55,756 --> 01:19:58,100
Seiko

737
01:19:59,655 --> 01:20:00,741
Seiko

738
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:02,881
Seiko

739
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:09,991
I'm relieved she's ok

740
01:20:13,868 --> 01:20:21,289
If that newspaper ad hadn't been read by you, I wasn't sure how to let you know.

741
01:20:23,004 --> 01:20:25,832
But all is my fault

742
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:30,324
Seiko hit her back and she can't walk

743
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:32,855
She hit her back? at where?

744
01:20:33,855 --> 01:20:39,480
At the stair.
She told me just before. She felt down

745
01:20:42,113 --> 01:20:46,027
That staircase has a high angle.
I've felt down before

746
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:52,617
But I wonder Sleeping pills has something to do with stair?

747
01:20:55,179 --> 01:20:58,015
She took sleeping pills and slept upstairs

748
01:20:59,062 --> 01:21:04,070
She suddenly became distressed and tried to drink water.

749
01:21:05,015 --> 01:21:06,835
Then she felt down

750
01:21:07,828 --> 01:21:10,609
Why she tried to sleep upstairs?

751
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:16,101
I don't know.
Doctor told me don't make her talk a lot

752
01:21:22,756 --> 01:21:27,022
This was happened because I went back to my apartment

753
01:21:29,016 --> 01:21:32,196
I don't feel like going to Paris now

754
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:39,469
I will stand by her, and look after her until she gets better

755
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:51,923
Sabori is here, so I have to leave now

756
01:21:53,157 --> 01:21:56,094
Sorry to bother you

757
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,058
Not at all.. well...I need to talk to you

758
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:11,125
i think her suicide is a lie

759
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:17,399
The doctor said she didn't take a lot of sleeping pills.

760
01:22:17,602 --> 01:22:18,649
But

761
01:22:18,797 --> 01:22:21,969
I know her very well

762
01:22:23,004 --> 01:22:28,012
When my child was born, Seiko was 6 years old

763
01:22:28,785 --> 01:22:35,199
Everyone was interested in the baby, so Seiko got jealous and cut her hand with a knife.

764
01:22:36,269 --> 01:22:40,754
She misunderstood that everyone was interested in her

765
01:22:41,259 --> 01:22:42,635
I saw the scar in her arm

766
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:43,799
That's it

767
01:22:47,065 --> 01:22:52,237
I thought she didn't need to fall down the stairs

768
01:22:52,588 --> 01:22:55,908
It's an accident that just happened

769
01:22:56,939 --> 01:23:03,525
It is also an accident that the injury when she hurt herself when she was a child became suppurated.

770
01:23:06,159 --> 01:23:08,073
Then see you

771
01:23:20,850 --> 01:23:23,678
After half a month, Seiko was discharged from the hospital.

772
01:23:24,443 --> 01:23:30,717
Her spine is braced and it is not yet known when she will be able to walk.

773
01:23:35,322 --> 01:23:38,353
I made a promise to move here with Seiko.

774
01:23:38,923 --> 01:23:39,892
You'll move in?

775
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:42,775
I'll be her nurse

776
01:23:43,564 --> 01:23:46,353
You'll live here again?

777
01:23:47,384 --> 01:23:48,267
Of course

778
01:23:49,519 --> 01:23:52,848
To be honest, I don't wanna have sex with you anymore

779
01:23:53,566 --> 01:23:56,168
I would offend Seiko.

780
01:23:58,113 --> 01:24:00,793
Can you put it up with it?

781
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:03,769
i found a good solution

782
01:24:05,592 --> 01:24:08,272
I have a favor to ask from you

783
01:24:09,061 --> 01:24:09,787
Tell me

784
01:24:10,162 --> 01:24:13,092
I heard that you were officially registered a long time ago.

785
01:24:13,467 --> 01:24:14,826
Yeah

786
01:24:17,116 --> 01:24:20,897
I also want to register marriage with you

787
01:24:21,342 --> 01:24:25,045
The Japanese Civil Code only allows one married couple.

788
01:24:25,483 --> 01:24:29,030
I want you to adopt me as your adopted daughter

789
01:24:29,467 --> 01:24:30,061
adopted daughter?

790
01:24:30,358 --> 01:24:32,280
You'll be my dad

791
01:24:32,913 --> 01:24:33,928
I'll be your dad?

792
01:24:35,842 --> 01:24:39,358
We can't.
We are only 4 years apart in age

793
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:49,256
Seiko said that if I'm not legally older, I can become your adopted daughter.

794
01:24:49,409 --> 01:24:51,299
Seiko said that?

795
01:24:52,565 --> 01:24:54,541
Hold on, I look up the law book

796
01:24:56,174 --> 01:24:58,315
I'm 1 yrs younger than Seiko

797
01:24:59,737 --> 01:25:01,830
I think this is an good idea

798
01:25:07,516 --> 01:25:08,290
Look

799
01:25:10,282 --> 01:25:12,009
Article 736

800
01:25:12,227 --> 01:25:18,204
Between spouses or their relatives or their adopted daughters

801
01:25:18,923 --> 01:25:22,321
According to the provisions of Article 729...this is about divorce

802
01:25:23,313 --> 01:25:26,438
Unable to marry even after kinship ends

803
01:25:29,060 --> 01:25:36,451
In other words, if Seiko-san dies, I won't be able to marry you.

804
01:25:37,544 --> 01:25:39,412
If the adoption is terminated, we cannot get married.

805
01:25:40,638 --> 01:25:41,341
Is that Ok?

806
01:25:42,248 --> 01:25:44,927
Yes no problem.
I feel easy going

807
01:25:49,259 --> 01:25:50,845
About the adopted daughter?

808
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:55,228
I know you are against it

809
01:26:00,289 --> 01:26:05,117
I know how you feel.
I talked with Maki just before

810
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:08,735
how about you get married?

811
01:26:08,985 --> 01:26:13,797
No way.
I would rather live with Mr. Success than live with him.

812
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:20,111
I want to live with you if possible

813
01:26:22,173 --> 01:26:27,798
But I don't know when my health will improve

814
01:26:29,661 --> 01:26:35,051
I wish I had died then and everything would have been fine

815
01:26:35,755 --> 01:26:40,794
that's a terrible idea.
I'm not going to marry him after you die

816
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:46,099
Even if you don't think so, it could be

817
01:26:49,152 --> 01:26:53,066
i have never thought of such a thing

818
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,253
Let's adopt MAKI anyway

819
01:27:02,394 --> 01:27:05,980
Really?
you made a decision?

820
01:27:06,652 --> 01:27:09,027
Are you sure?

821
01:27:10,042 --> 01:27:12,378
Yes if you are ok

822
01:27:13,058 --> 01:27:16,261
I don't mind if you decide it

823
01:27:17,323 --> 01:27:21,589
You should take good filial piety when you become an adopted daughter.

824
01:27:22,066 --> 01:27:23,503
Of course

825
01:27:25,616 --> 01:27:30,077
I have suffered a lot from you, so from now on I will be selfish.

826
01:27:31,669 --> 01:27:32,247
Sure

827
01:27:32,739 --> 01:27:33,497
Right,Dad?

828
01:27:35,443 --> 01:27:37,286
Don't call me Dad

829
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,333
I'm still 29

830
01:27:39,419 --> 01:27:43,060
But you will be a father in six months

831
01:27:47,032 --> 01:27:53,969
We have a daughter, I hope we'll have a boy

832
01:28:03,290 --> 01:28:06,524
Let's sunbathe a little on the porch for your baby

833
01:28:07,282 --> 01:28:08,547
Take me to there

834
01:28:09,392 --> 01:28:12,735
Please take her on the porch

835
01:28:20,552 --> 01:28:27,654
Maybe her suicide this time was her made-up story.

836
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:35,800
In other words, Maki and I were successfully deceived by this Seiko

837
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:38,628
No way

838
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:41,768
i have a sexual aesthetic

839
01:28:43,206 --> 01:28:48,221
I have a sexual aesthetic that was endorsed as revolutionary sex

840
01:28:49,753 --> 01:28:50,440
But...

841
01:28:52,440 --> 01:28:53,323
But...

842
01:29:14,278 --> 01:29:22,734
THE END

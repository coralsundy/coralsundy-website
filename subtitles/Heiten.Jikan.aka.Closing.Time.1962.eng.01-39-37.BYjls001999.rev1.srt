00:00:14,327 --> 00:00:23,503
Heiten Jikan / Closing Time (1962)

3
00:01:50,306 --> 00:01:51,281
Thank you for visiting us today.

4
00:01:51,306 --> 00:01:56,656
Thank you very much, welcome, welcome

5
00:01:59,054 --> 00:02:00,921
Good morning, everyone

6
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,703
Thank you for coming today

7
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:05,966
Thank you for visiting us

8
00:02:07,887 --> 00:02:09,578
Thank you in advance

9
00:02:10,485 --> 00:02:12,210
Please wait a moment

10
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:18,375
On the 8th floor, American, France and Italian clothing is sold.

11
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,056
Hey there!

12
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:19,706
Good morning!

13
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:20,166
That's not good

14
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,636
You're late!

15
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,126
I'm sorry, but I got caught up with work

16
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:23,726
You need to stick to the schedule, or it will be a problem!

17
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,437
Eh?

18
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,140
Good morning!

19
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,765
I want 5 croquettes

20
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,984
Which?

21
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,150
Cheaper one.

22
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:35,875
I'll have two menchi katsu.

23
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,133
Please. Just a moment.

24
00:02:37,158 --> 00:02:38,906
Yes, two menchi katsu. I'll help you.

25
00:02:39,023 --> 00:02:39,805
Sorry

26
00:02:39,889 --> 00:02:42,015
I'll have 100 of kinpira, please.

27
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,188
Please. Just a moment.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,646
We're open now

29
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:45,826
Are you ready?

30
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,242
Please do not talk.

31
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,851
Good morning.

32
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,602
Good morning.

33
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,776
The smoke button is loose

34
00:02:54,877 --> 00:02:56,414
You should puff out your chest.

35
00:02:58,743 --> 00:02:59,641
Good morning.

36
00:03:00,329 --> 00:03:00,891
Good morning.

37
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:03,398
Your lips are too much, so please make them thinner

38
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:04,716
Well, it's time to open the store

39
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,676
Good morning, customers are coming up

40
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,816
Good morning

41
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:09,826
Don't forget to smile.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,850
This is our motto, so that's great

43
00:03:13,605 --> 00:03:14,836
Good morning

44
00:03:14,977 --> 00:03:16,187
We are opening

45
00:03:17,171 --> 00:03:18,725
What is gohachi?

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,086
It's about the customer

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,656
Gohashijuu means to come

48
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,386
Is that so?

49
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,546
You might understand it soon since you're new here

50
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:27,937
There are various Phrasing.

51
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,273
For example, about meal,it's hachihachi.

52
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,508
When you write the character for rice, it looks like 88, right?

53
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,953
then, about the toilet, 44, in other words, it's pee.

54
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:43,438
hey you, stop the nonsense, can't you see customers?

55
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,102
Welcome.

56
00:03:47,127 --> 00:03:50,633
You know, I wonder if this will not lose color even if I wipe it with gasoline.

57
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,625
I think it should be fine.

58
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:54,118
I wanna make it sure.

59
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,699
Is there anyone else who understands?

60
00:03:55,856 --> 00:03:57,036
It's all right

61
00:03:57,462 --> 00:03:58,945
But this is plant-dyed.

62
00:03:59,118 --> 00:04:01,329
it does contain a bit of chemical dye

63
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,641
The color stop is perfect

64
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,727
It definitely won't come off unless it's soap

65
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,445
That's reassuring, then I'll take this.

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,883
 Thank you as always

67
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:15,770
Thank you for visiting us every time

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:21,711
Next, we have a shopping guide for 4 sets of 5 bedding

69
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,466
I'll go 4F

70
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:25,437
Yes, understood

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,766
Thank you for your patience

72
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,297
This will be the fourth floor.

73
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,556
I'll go 6F

74
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,736
Understood

75
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,227
Have you been kept waiting?

76
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,906
Children's clothes are very expensive

77
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,486
My child is in elementary school, but

78
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,836
If it feels narrow, it makes me feel inferior

79
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,496
It's quite tough, you know, the PTA meeting

80
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,531
That's right, mothers never wear the same kimono twice.

81
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,977
Thank you for waiting

82
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,922
This is 6F.

83
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:01,687
Excuse me, excuse me, how about this for my daughter?

84
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:03,993
Does anyone else want to get off?

85
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,626
Next is the rooftop

86
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,117
We have gardening supplies and a baby zoo

87
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,508
This is the last floor.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,168
This is the last floor.

89
00:05:30,566 --> 00:05:31,984
but I want to go to the 7th floor

90
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,006
This is an even-numbered floor stop.

91
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:34,676
If it's the 7th floor,

92
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,486
Please go down the stairs on the right

93
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,510
So I can go back six floor and go up the stairs, right?

94
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:40,321
Go ahead.

95
00:05:43,937 --> 00:05:45,437
It seems that is a love letter

96
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,463
Yes.

97
00:05:46,488 --> 00:05:48,696
Do you get that often?

98
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:49,235
Yes.

99
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,047
how envious I am of you.

100
00:05:57,704 --> 00:05:59,282
Maybe I should give it a try too

101
00:06:01,518 --> 00:06:02,719
We are going down.

102
00:06:11,266 --> 00:06:13,129
Where have you been wasting time?

103
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:14,855
What are you saying at a time like this?

104
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,844
I'm with the bee of the lady inside the store

105
00:06:18,246 --> 00:06:19,328
What's wrong with that?

106
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:21,016
You just joined recently

107
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,375
Don't talk back so arrogantly

108
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:23,415
What?

109
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:25,867
Don't they teach manners at university?

110
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,616
I've been here four years longer than you, you know

111
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,297
If you're a senior, act like one

112
00:06:30,562 --> 00:06:33,437
You don't even know the good and bad of dyeing, so that's why women are no good

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,646
What do you mean by saying women are no good?

114
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:39,256
You're just working hard to be prepared, kill time, and make some pocket money, right?

115
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,836
It means there's no harshness

116
00:06:40,861 --> 00:06:42,344
Well, that's rude

117
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,676
I'm just killing time anyway
It's not just a side hustle

118
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,866
I find purpose in this job and that's why I do it

119
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,874
I can do the same job as you.

120
00:06:50,796 --> 00:06:53,499
So, are you planning to become a section chief and then a department head, even though you're a woman?

121
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,950
Well, what do you mean by 'even though you're a woman'?

122
00:06:57,141 --> 00:06:59,897
I'm doing this as if I'm going
to become an executive,

123
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:01,749
Come on, this is a workplace.

124
00:07:02,409 --> 00:07:03,175
It's fine, it's fine

125
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,656
Take this and deliver it

126
00:07:06,094 --> 00:07:09,714
Excuse me, but for all that enthusiasm, you lack knowledge about the business.

127
00:07:10,448 --> 00:07:11,167
Ubukata

128
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:12,753
Just stop it; it's embarrassing. You're a woman, after all

129
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,995
If you keep it modest, there won't be any problems, okay?

130
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,826
Because I'm a woman

131
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,116
Just because I'm a woman

132
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,201
Why do I have to be modest?

133
00:07:33,227 --> 00:07:34,264
Can I have some curry?

134
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,164
Is it lunchtime already?

135
00:07:35,284 --> 00:07:36,477
Oh, you're busy, huh?

136
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,485
Can I have some milk?

137
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,337
Yes, curry.

138
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,460
Hello.

139
00:07:58,515 --> 00:07:59,842
Oh Secchan.

140
00:08:00,674 --> 00:08:02,111
Oh, what's wrong?

141
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:05,678
I know there's someone unpleasant in the same section

142
00:08:06,343 --> 00:08:08,963
He's been with us for three months and he's a terrible man.

143
00:08:11,523 --> 00:08:13,209
That's how women are, right?

144
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,536
Male employees become section chiefs and take office

145
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,285
They'll keep getting promoted, right?

146
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,005
Even if a female employee works for 10 years,

147
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,404
She's just a salesgirl

148
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:23,610
Thinking about it makes me sad and angry

149
00:08:24,263 --> 00:08:26,429
but you eat a lot.

150
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,336
When I'm sad, I eat a lot.

151
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,534
I wonder if I should get some milk too

152
00:08:34,686 --> 00:08:35,786
I'll give you this.

153
00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:37,950
Really? Thanks.

154
00:08:39,522 --> 00:08:41,393
At this rate, it's not a big deal.

155
00:08:41,944 --> 00:08:44,311
Come on, listen to me a little more sincerely

156
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,535
Aren't you getting angry?

157
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,425
Women are often said to work just to kill time and earn a little pocket money

158
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:52,236
Well, that's how I am, so there's nothing I can do about it

159
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,260
How pathetic

160
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,966
Put in more effort!

161
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,886
I'll lose your fighting spirit

162
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:01,446
Because, you know, I'm the type of person who tends to be dependent on others

163
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:04,940
And from morning till night, I was chased around by croquettes and kinpira gobo

164
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,348
People are becoming more and more down-to-earth

165
00:09:07,816 --> 00:09:11,991
Oh dear, but you were such a romantic during high school, weren't you?

166
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,846
I hear you're going to have an amazing romance with a wonderful young gentleman

167
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,556
What happened to your theory on love?

168
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,076
It's because the items being handled are special

169
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,011
It can't be helped

170
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,066
You have a 70,000 yen visiting kimono

171
00:09:21,096 --> 00:09:24,096
My croquettes that cost 7 yen each

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,394
I wonder what a deluxe love is like 70,000 yen?

173
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,080
I'm sure we're working every day in search of love

174
00:09:32,502 --> 00:09:33,909
Have you found someone you like?

175
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,586
I don't have that kind of time

176
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,156
I'm currently at this point

177
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,180
I really want to crush that arrogant rookie's nose when my stomach starts to feel full

178
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,352
I'm full,that make me to fight again.

179
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,526
You haven't changed at all

180
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,866
Strong-willed, conceptual, and combative

181
00:09:50,016 --> 00:09:54,576
Your junior was quite a handful, just like back in the basketball club days.

182
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,513
For both me and Sayuri-chan.

183
00:09:56,538 --> 00:09:57,833
I miss the old days.

184
00:09:58,513 --> 00:10:00,850
Back then, we didn't yet know what the world was really like

185
00:10:01,732 --> 00:10:05,168
Hey, how about inviting Sayuri-chan tonight and having a party for the first time in a while?

186
00:10:05,246 --> 00:10:06,181
Yeah, that sounds nice.

187
00:10:06,781 --> 00:10:08,521
your beautiful face

188
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,447
Your pretty feet

189
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,872
What a magnificent bust!

190
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:12,752
He's so pervert.

191
00:10:12,918 --> 00:10:16,716
Every time I think of it, I sigh during the day and can't sleep at night

192
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:17,976
I feel like I'm going to die

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,186
Please save me from my suffering

194
00:10:20,842 --> 00:10:22,316
I wonder what's going on.

195
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,110
Who gave this to you?

196
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,920
He's uncool, He has acne face.

197
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:28,665
I've received about twenty letters in the elevator

198
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,776
There wasn't anyone decent

199
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,800
The other day, I was hugged by a bald old man

200
00:10:36,793 --> 00:10:39,009
Hello, this is the service department

201
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:42,806
She's here, Sayuri-chan, it's a phone call

202
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:47,616
I'm sorry

203
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,826
Hello? Ryo-chan.

204
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:51,847
Good afternoon.

205
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,604
Tonight?

206
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,531
Sure,I'm free.

207
00:10:56,392 --> 00:10:57,445
I get it.

208
00:10:57,742 --> 00:10:58,556
Well then.

209
00:10:59,594 --> 00:11:00,341
Sayuri-chan

210
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:01,268
what?

211
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,016
How many boyfriends do you have?

212
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,306
Numbers and quantity

213
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:06,126
The quality drops completely

214
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,129
I really want an amazing guy.

215
00:11:10,704 --> 00:11:12,687
You are being extravagant.

216
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:15,604
everyone, it's your turn.

217
00:11:20,937 --> 00:11:22,584
Hello? Yes

218
00:11:24,103 --> 00:11:24,749
Sayuri-chan

219
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:25,929
It's another call.

220
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:29,217
it's rare because it's from a woman

221
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,190
Hello, this is Maki. Oh, is that you, Secchan? Huh?

222
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,886
Three people?

223
00:11:36,456 --> 00:11:37,454
Sounds good, doesn't it?

224
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,130
Sorry, I have plans tonight

225
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:44,715
I'm sorry.

226
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:55,505
Wait.

227
00:11:56,295 --> 00:11:58,528
why am I the only one investigating this?

228
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,571
I had a bit of a hunch, but it's because of the rules

229
00:12:02,644 --> 00:12:06,626
Excuse me,
I feel unpleasant.

230
00:12:06,657 --> 00:12:08,736
Security checks are tight here.

231
00:12:10,016 --> 00:12:10,935
Where are we going?

232
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,442
Let's go to city.

233
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,554
Secchan's dream of love is a passionate love

234
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,296
A blazing hot love burning bright red

235
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,176
What about your love?

236
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:39,439
Come on, it must be a blue love

237
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,540
A painful love

238
00:13:40,829 --> 00:13:41,374
Why?

239
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:43,055
Because you are calm by nature, right?

240
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,804
That's why

241
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,901
Don't say unpleasant things

242
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,126
Isn't that Sayuri-chan?

243
00:13:53,407 --> 00:13:54,115
Oh, I'm sorry, did you wait?

244
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,505
Hmm, where should we go?

245
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,246
Anywhere is fine

246
00:13:56,358 --> 00:13:57,204
Let's have a meal.

247
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:02,768
Yeah, that person is an actor who appears on TV from time to time

248
00:14:04,227 --> 00:14:05,847
Sayuri-chan's love is yellow.

249
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:09,943
We, as seniors, should give her a heads up.

250
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,956
Sayuri-chan has rumora; her bungee jumping is flashy

251
00:14:12,981 --> 00:14:14,023
She has a lot of boyfriends, back in the day, you know

252
00:14:14,593 --> 00:14:16,781
I could call and preach, but

253
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,475
It's no good, that person's path is also a life of its own

254
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,601
We are living the same life; which is better and which is worse?

255
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,926
No one understands, you know

256
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:26,924
That's true.

257
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:32,274
In fact, that person might be enjoying life more than we are

258
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:36,451
Look.

259
00:14:38,134 --> 00:14:39,634
There're only couples.

260
00:14:47,954 --> 00:14:50,227
Why are there so many couples?

261
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:52,574
Men really have no eye for things.

262
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:55,026
They leave wonderful women like us alone

263
00:14:55,069 --> 00:14:57,765
Shall we go for getting a guy too?

264
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,244
What do you think about him?

265
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:02,090
Maybe 80 points?

266
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,500
75 points

267
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,526
How about smiling and talk him?

268
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,266
Doesn't he think we are crazy?

269
00:15:07,296 --> 00:15:09,792
I'm sorry, but is it okay.
Let's go.

270
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:14,870
It's interesting, so why not look for more?

271
00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:22,055
Hey, don't you think that person is nice?

272
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:22,790
Which one?

273
00:15:22,886 --> 00:15:24,812
That guy in the Mambo style?

274
00:15:25,016 --> 00:15:26,570
I don't like him at all.

275
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,715
Your taste is terrible.

276
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:31,226
Do you really think so?

277
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:35,838
What do you think about that?

278
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,522
Huh? Which one?

279
00:15:37,547 --> 00:15:39,380
The person standing at the corner over there.

280
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,759
The guy who has rain coat?

281
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:44,669
That's a bit nice.

282
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,237
it's more than just a bit.

283
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,238
I've admired people like that since I was little

284
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,885
I'm into a guy like him.

285
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:53,977
That's wonderful, isn't it?

286
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:56,303
Hey, hurry up and make your move!

287
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,393
How?

288
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,546
You just need to wink in front of that person

289
00:15:59,570 --> 00:16:00,396
Wink with one eye?

290
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,183
Well, in other words, it's a wink.

291
00:16:02,472 --> 00:16:04,079
I can't.

292
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:05,776
No, this isn't the time to be saying things like that

293
00:16:05,918 --> 00:16:06,793
Eh, hurry up!

294
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:08,833
No, it's okay.

295
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:10,561
I can't.

296
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:13,565
This isn't easy, right? You just have to do it like this, right?

297
00:16:14,064 --> 00:16:14,944
Like this?

298
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:16,295
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

299
00:16:24,872 --> 00:16:25,632
I can't.

300
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:26,676
Yeah, it's okay

301
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,518
Are you ready?

302
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,630
Did you wait for long?

303
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:34,476
You are late

304
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,309
Let's go

305
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,226
Hey sis, did you just wink at us?

306
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,931
Wow, you look nice.

307
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,195
If you’re that bored, I’ll play with you

308
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,576
It's still too early to go home

309
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,416
Let's dance

310
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,306
Or drive?

311
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,267
We have domestic car.

312
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,486
Let's go to Roppongi

313
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,816
Or should we go to Yokohama?

314
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,836
You're just bored anyway, right? Hey! Hey!

315
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,396
Why are you running away!

316
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,636
Where are you going!

317
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,194
Did they come after us?

318
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,099
It seems it's okay

319
00:17:02,052 --> 00:17:02,538
My apologies.

320
00:17:03,883 --> 00:17:04,772
Oh Teacher.

321
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:07,144
what happened here?

322
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:11,085
I was followed by a strange man

323
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,606
Did you just wink?

324
00:17:13,604 --> 00:17:14,944
This person winked

325
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,079
That's terrible.

326
00:17:18,774 --> 00:17:20,938
but you're okay now, right?

327
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,506
Are you alone, sir?

328
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:24,926
Yes, there was a bit of time before the broadcast

329
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,529
I was watching a movie and oh no, I need a taxi!

330
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:31,899
Excuse me.

331
00:17:35,951 --> 00:17:36,778
Goodbye.

332
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,919
Who is that person?

333
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:42,226
The teacher from the library I'm going.

334
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:43,206
He's a bit handsome.

335
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,306
Just your type, huh?

336
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,936
No, he has a wife

337
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,063
Oh, It's going t be trouble.

338
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,149
Oh are you coming home now?

339
00:17:50,927 --> 00:17:51,853
See you then.

340
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,889
I wonder who that person was.

341
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,474
Come on.

342
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,240
I can't even remember.

343
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:07,916
Everyone is couple

344
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,776
There's nothing we can do about it

345
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,156
Shall we eat something before heading home?

346
00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:12,100
I'm going to eat a lot

347
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:28,743
My apologies.

348
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,562
Good morning, good morning!

349
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:39,483
Good morning, good morning!

350
00:18:39,508 --> 00:18:40,537
Watch out.

351
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:41,832
Good morning, good morning!

352
00:18:44,911 --> 00:18:46,118
Good morning, good morning!

353
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:48,815
Good morning, good morning!

354
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,400
Good morning, good morning!

355
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,510
Oh sorry.

356
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:02,915
My name is Takei.
I deliver goods here every morning.

357
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,328
I believed I met you somewhere.

358
00:19:05,485 --> 00:19:07,205
You stayed cool.

359
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:08,862
I was disappointed.

360
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:12,408
I helped you that morning with your menchikatsu.

361
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:14,736
Oh, did that happen?

362
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,970
Oh my god.

363
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:20,776
the opening is approaching, cut it out.

364
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:21,836
My apologies.

365
00:19:25,792 --> 00:19:27,307
I'll make sure to remember you this time

366
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,921
Please.

367
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,006
7th floor?

368
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,906
Could you stop?

369
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:36,296
Today, I'm handle in an odd-numbered floor.

370
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,426
Are you shopping on the 7th floor?

371
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,383
No.
it's for work

372
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,214
Oh are you working here?

373
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:40,815
Yes.

374
00:19:40,939 --> 00:19:43,665
You have to take the employee elevator; otherwise, it's against the rules

375
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,655
I work at advertising department, so it doesn't matter

376
00:19:46,376 --> 00:19:49,922
Talking about anything other than explanations in the elevator is against the rules

377
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,449
Well then, I won't talk anymore.

378
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,991
I'm sure you'll have nice day.

379
00:19:59,059 --> 00:20:00,215
Because I was able to ride in the elevator with Maki.

380
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,446
Do you know my name?

381
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,852
Look, you're talking again, yay!

382
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,866
Who are you looking for?

383
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,596
It's not like I'm looking for anyone specific

384
00:20:43,548 --> 00:20:45,846
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't make it the other day.

385
00:20:46,015 --> 00:20:47,015
Oh, it's fine

386
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:49,896
The employee book is quite messy

387
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,982
It's because girls are always flipping through pages looking for a good man.

388
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,177
Did you say someone nice?

389
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,216
It's quite hard.

390
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,448
You say you have quite a few boyfriends, don't you?

391
00:21:00,873 --> 00:21:03,873
I saw you walking with some TV actor the other day

392
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,647
Ah, I'm getting a bit tired of him.

393
00:21:07,406 --> 00:21:09,095
It seems to be gaining some popularity

394
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,332
So you should be careful.

395
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:11,193
it's fine.

396
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,856
We have to enjoy life

397
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,521
Take a look!

398
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,416
See, it's changing more and more, right?

399
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,829
It's like metabolism

400
00:21:20,193 --> 00:21:25,300
Company always want to have a fresh, red girl at the desk and in the elevator

401
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,371
So they want us to quit at the right time

402
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,556
What does it mean to work hard for a lifetime?

403
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,966
I can't just say that so easily

404
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,846
There are many kids who say things like Sayuri-chan

405
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,519
Women are always looked down upon.

406
00:21:38,546 --> 00:21:42,586
I wonder if that's true. But more than that, isn't it better if we can just live happily in the end?

407
00:21:44,376 --> 00:21:46,010
This guy is kind of nice, huh?

408
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:47,801
Oh, you're terrible.

409
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:49,612
You think so?

410
00:21:49,637 --> 00:21:51,278
 Wow, this person is famous in our section.

411
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,359
I see this person's face even at my place

412
00:21:52,384 --> 00:21:55,384
Many women come to see this man.

413
00:21:56,061 --> 00:21:57,068
They have bad taste.

414
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:02,854
Who?

415
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:06,372
I just saw someone who looked fun.

416
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,700
Ah, if I had someone like that, I would quit the library too

417
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,446
Oh, are you still going to that place?

418
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,726
Life is dry, so

419
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,836
I'm going to seek some moisture

420
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:17,216
Aren't you going to start again, Sayori-chan?

421
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,190
Isn't there someone you like over there?

422
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:22,666
No way.

423
00:22:23,113 --> 00:22:23,720
Really?

424
00:22:23,989 --> 00:22:24,972
That's suspicious

425
00:22:25,239 --> 00:22:26,119
Oh my god.

426
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,527
work work

427
00:22:27,745 --> 00:22:32,402
Welcome,Next, we are at the front of the easy order section for sportswear on the 3rd floor

428
00:22:32,678 --> 00:22:33,661
Well then

429
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:41,281
December 7th, 10th year of Bunsei

430
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,855
Kagoshima, facing the smoking Sakurajima, is warm and tropical even in winter

431
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,026
Under the sunlight,

432
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:50,983
it showed a lively atmosphere typical of a castle town with 720,000 koku from the Satsuma domain

433
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:54,436
In Kajimachi, by the banks of the Kamizukigawa flowing through this town,

434
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,866
It was on this day that Nissan raised its voice,

435
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:57,496
Responsible for the military force during the Meiji Restoration

436
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,197
It was Takamori Saigo from Nanshu

437
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,557
At that time, the Saigo family's household was made up of old book collectors

438
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,118
In Satsuma....

439
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,800
This is Mr. Sato's,right?

440
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,286
His voice is loud, though

441
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,046
He's speaking a bit fast.

442
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,253
That's right

443
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,280
I don't mean to read slowly

444
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:17,058
Take in the meaning of the words

445
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,036
I think that will bring out more flavor, don't you think?

446
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,546
I'm really sorry

447
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:23,724
You don't have to apologize

448
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:28,036
Next, let's have Wakatsuki-san come over

449
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:30,737
Please

450
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:35,352
Studio4 has been empty.

451
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,036
I'm sorry to keep you waiting

452
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:41,005
No, it was nice to see how the photographers have been studying after such a long time

453
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,916
It made me feel a bittersweet emotion

454
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,156
Thinking that I was like that at first too

455
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,116
Everyone makes progress quickly

456
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,834
It's impressive that this is a free newspaper for those with poor eyesight, but what is this?

457
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:53,616
Look at this.

458
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:54,510
What's this?

459
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:56,325
This is a letter of concern for you

460
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,350
From Fukushima Prefecture

461
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:07,353
Thank you always.

462
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:11,331
Since I came as a bride and had children

463
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:14,696
I have struggled a lot since becoming a blind person

464
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:21,516
I asked neighborhood child to write this.

465
00:24:22,192 --> 00:24:26,499
I can't read Braille no matter how much I practice.

466
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,300
I enjoy listening radio.

467
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,722
My son bought me a tape recorder.

468
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:38,848
These days, listening to Matsuno-san's voice is my greatest joy

469
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:53,165
Okamoto Kanoko: Flowers are strong

470
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:57,018
The first reading will be by Kuniko Matsuno

471
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:01,882
The murky water in the glass box filled with blue mud has turned leaden,

472
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:12,547
and the two calico goldfish that had been swimming splendidly until now sink in unison, sensing the weight of the atmospheric pressure

473
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,985
As if deliberately aligned, the two faces

474
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:20,520
The reading directed this way is by Kuniko Matsuno

475
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:30,568
The stagnant water in the glass box filled with blue mud has become cloudy and leaden, where the two calico Matsuno-san had been swimming splendidly until now

476
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:32,576
What amazing progress!

477
00:25:32,981 --> 00:25:34,481
Thanks to you.

478
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:38,404
Because you made an effort a lot.

479
00:25:40,527 --> 00:25:45,162
But I feel I'm at my limit, and I would like you to make a time for me.

480
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,046
What can I do to make more progress from here on?

481
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,946
I would like you to teach me slowly

482
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:52,559
Well, I have nothing more to teach you

483
00:25:52,743 --> 00:25:53,890
That's not true.

484
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:56,355
I have some recording work to do now.

485
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,396
It's for the dubbing of an American TV movie

486
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,036
If I try that too

487
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,316
It's quite interesting, you know

488
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:00,854
Well then.

489
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:23,053
16 yen, 88yen, 55 yen, or 87 yen

490
00:26:23,469 --> 00:26:24,447
250 yen

491
00:26:24,768 --> 00:26:26,128
I'll take 250 yen

492
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,460
Thanks.

493
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,608
Hey, what's up, Secchan?

494
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:33,740
Hey, Let's go for drive next day off

495
00:26:33,765 --> 00:26:35,972
Wow, that's wonderful!
Who's going?

496
00:26:36,006 --> 00:26:37,879
I heard that Tomiza borrowed a friend's car

497
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:38,656
It's me, right?

498
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,446
It's you, right?

499
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,707
Then, Nami-chan
and Ohara-san from the sales floor.

500
00:26:41,772 --> 00:26:44,271
Aren't you all lovers?

501
00:26:44,296 --> 00:26:44,811
That's right

502
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,026
So you should bring someone too

503
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,176
I can't

504
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,554
I don't have anyone with me

505
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,830
Anyone is fine, a man... hey, take a look behind you for a second

506
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:53,705
The manager is glaring at you

507
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,593
Be careful.

508
00:26:57,886 --> 00:26:59,755
How about Kawashima at the paper sales section?

509
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,326
No, he's not getting married next month

510
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,576
Is that guy already sold?

511
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,716
How about him?

512
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,104
Who?

513
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:07,331
The person in charge at Otomoya.

514
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:09,546
Ah, Takei-san, that's good. Well then, let's discuss the details later

515
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:11,306
Ah,I'll have this kinpira.

516
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:13,557
I'll this tsukudani

517
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:15,064
Hold on please.

518
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,129
Oh, it's already been 20 minutes

519
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:49,833
Were there someone?

520
00:27:49,858 --> 00:27:50,627
No.

521
00:27:50,652 --> 00:27:52,548
Can anyone recognize who I am?

522
00:27:52,573 --> 00:27:53,819
No.

523
00:27:55,414 --> 00:27:58,094
I'm glad he didn't see my face.

524
00:28:44,313 --> 00:28:45,679
Excuse me earlier.

525
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:50,615
Women do their skin care when they are in love or when bored, right?

526
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,446
Well, I guess it's more likely when I am bored

527
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,499
In my case.

528
00:28:55,085 --> 00:28:57,152
my next day off is my birthday

529
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,626
Would you like to have a meal together?

530
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,250
Huh?

531
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,590
I'll make a reservation, so don't forget. See you later!

532
00:29:14,415 --> 00:29:15,911
This care is pretty good.

533
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,571
the driver is skilled, right?

534
00:29:17,685 --> 00:29:18,312
Of course.

535
00:29:19,622 --> 00:29:20,249
Don't you want to eat a donuts?

536
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,150
Wow, that's wonderful!

537
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:24,264
If you gain too much weight, I might reconsider my plans.

538
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:25,624
What do you mean?

539
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:27,997
I might reconsider my plans to propose to you.

540
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,921
Well then, I'll stop.

541
00:29:32,603 --> 00:29:33,956
This one is delicious!

542
00:29:41,687 --> 00:29:43,846
It smells good and looks tasty.

543
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,800
Is it still not ready?

544
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,589
Yes, it's done! Oh, thank you!

545
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:49,254
Pass me the source.

546
00:29:49,469 --> 00:29:50,521
It seems the tart has baked a bit

547
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:53,766
Thank you for waiting

548
00:29:53,812 --> 00:29:55,027
Yes, it's done, right?

549
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:56,520
This looks delicious.

550
00:29:57,976 --> 00:29:58,763
Here you go

551
00:30:00,777 --> 00:30:01,450
Here.

552
00:30:02,249 --> 00:30:03,199
How about this?

553
00:30:03,882 --> 00:30:05,071
Yeah, Takei-san, you should eat too

554
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,456
You don't have to hold back

555
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,721
I'll take a bite too

556
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:12,657
it's delicious.

557
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:14,038
 Please help yourself if you'd like

558
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,964
I'll take some

559
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:16,841
I'll take some too.

560
00:30:18,167 --> 00:30:19,073
it's so tasty.

561
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:20,791
Can I have some too?

562
00:30:20,816 --> 00:30:21,542
Please.

563
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,125
I guess the only meal for Pikupiku is rice balls, huh?

564
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,618
We should have brought dessert after the meal.

565
00:30:27,324 --> 00:30:31,015
I bought these from the Arctic corner in the basement of the store, Please take it.

566
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,360
I really love juice.

567
00:30:35,186 --> 00:30:37,751
Oh, it's a opposite, isn't it?

568
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,426
You seem to be common, but you're quite considerate

569
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:41,783
Really.

570
00:30:44,022 --> 00:30:45,955
Take that juice.

571
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,620
I heard those two are getting engaged soon

572
00:30:59,293 --> 00:31:02,233
They are in love too

573
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,611
Is that so?

574
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:07,196
Do you see anyone?

575
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,916
I really don't have that much free time

576
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,198
Are you a workaholic?

577
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
Not really, but I was surprised too

578
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,006
What is it?

579
00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:19,900
You really are a homely person; they say that good cooks

580
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,583
Homely women are no longer in fashion.

581
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,277
Why is that?

582
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:25,956
Because electric appliances have advanced

583
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,102
A man can handle small things, right?

584
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,540
That's why women with glamorous bodies are considered valuable

585
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,972
That's not true

586
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,556
I generally don't like tall women that much

587
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,844
That's disgusting

588
00:31:43,164 --> 00:31:45,775
Was it a bother to invite you today?

589
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:50,352
Not at all, it was an honor to go for a drive with everyone

590
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:54,706
You must be very considerate of everyone, right?

591
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,691
It's a strange to  think about The relationship between department stores and wholesaler.

592
00:32:00,531 --> 00:32:03,690
I'm young but my way of thinking is a bit old-fashioned.

593
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:07,765
Do my friends often tell me that.

594
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,790
But I have lived my life humbly in my own way

595
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,730
That's quite plain and realistic

596
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,150
But for me, it was an enjoyable holiday

597
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,860
I can't believe I can talk to you like this so slowly

598
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,463
I had fun too

599
00:32:30,053 --> 00:32:32,357
I wonder what everyone is doing on this holiday.

600
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:40,232
Sorry for making you wait.

601
00:32:46,552 --> 00:32:47,818
Sayuri-chan

602
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:50,276
Who are you going to meet?

603
00:32:50,576 --> 00:32:52,495
I'll meet a new friend.

604
00:32:52,782 --> 00:32:53,227
handsome guy?

605
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,210
More than you.

606
00:32:54,477 --> 00:32:56,234
Excuse me.

607
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:56,916
handsome guy?

608
00:32:57,194 --> 00:32:58,287
More than you.

609
00:32:59,313 --> 00:33:00,527
He's a bit of a tough opponent.

610
00:33:00,655 --> 00:33:02,705
It's not just a little thing, you know?

611
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:04,925
You should not definitely get married.

612
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:06,695
it's boring.

613
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:08,514
Oh, sorry to keep you waiting.

614
00:33:08,873 --> 00:33:10,499
I had a meeting for the fashion show.

615
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,857
I was kept waiting by a boy for the first time or anything

616
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:14,506
It's not like I'm a cute boy.

617
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:16,436
I'm already 32, you know

618
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:18,263
Hahaha, you are an old man,

619
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:19,162
Sorry.

620
00:33:19,271 --> 00:33:19,764
Who's he?

621
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:24,755
Me? Nice to meet you, I'm Keiichi, 22, Sayuri's friend.

622
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:26,732
I guess you can go home now

623
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,086
Is that so? Well then,

624
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,586
I'll call you again later

625
00:33:33,239 --> 00:33:34,367
He's quite an unusual friend, isn't it?

626
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Hey, Sayuri-chan, I know I'm being persistent, but...

627
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,076
Once a woman gets married, that's the end of it

628
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,529
Oh, I'm sorry,

629
00:33:44,529 --> 00:33:45,885
He follow me around

630
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:47,912
Is it really fun to play with a kid like that?

631
00:33:48,548 --> 00:33:50,174
Old man is more interesting.

632
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:53,615
Well, at least you have to be someone like me to be considered charming as a man

633
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,146
Ah, this is a celebration

634
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:57,720
It's just a small token,

635
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,136
I'm really touched

636
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,296
I received a present from Miss Department Store.

637
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,732
Miss Marutaka Department Store?

638
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:04,708
I've thought that for a while

639
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:07,505
Hehe, it's quite extravagant.

640
00:34:08,873 --> 00:34:09,756
This is awesome.

641
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:10,755
but if you like it, then go for it

642
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,677
I'm happy.

643
00:34:12,115 --> 00:34:13,889
it has good taste and it's cheap too

644
00:34:14,238 --> 00:34:15,615
Oh, you have a bad mouth.

645
00:34:16,076 --> 00:34:19,623
It comes up in conversations between my aging parents

646
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,919
Many names that I heard and remembered since childhood came to mind

647
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:29,849
Marriages between families of equal status held significant importance in their minds

648
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,626
A major event in the national society

649
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:34,130
It carried a similar level of importance

650
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,436
They have never seen their faces

651
00:34:36,553 --> 00:34:40,224
They spoke as if they knew people very well

652
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:43,546
You did a great job!

653
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,536
To put it nicely

654
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,116
So you want to add a bit more intonation

655
00:34:46,991 --> 00:34:50,349
Well then, thank you very much for today, and good job everyone

656
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:59,906
Oh, today wasn't your recording day, was it?

657
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,794
it's my regular day off

658
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:06,435
I came to visit a friend's house nearby, so I thought I'd visited.

659
00:35:06,818 --> 00:35:08,834
I was wondering if you were free, you know?

660
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,116
I'm available today, though

661
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,016
Is something wrong?

662
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,306
Oh, I asked you the other day, didn't I?

663
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,185
I asked you to give me some advise.

664
00:35:15,787 --> 00:35:17,173
It's not that I'm going to do it

665
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,696
Well then, let's hear your story

666
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:19,662
Let's have a meal together.

667
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:21,553
I'm so happy.

668
00:35:24,131 --> 00:35:25,178
Matsuno-san, can you drink?

669
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:26,584
Yes little.

670
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,912
Well then, let's drink first.

671
00:35:28,139 --> 00:35:28,873
Teacher.

672
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,213
This is a call from your home, sir

673
00:35:33,595 --> 00:35:34,623
Excuse me for a moment.

674
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:36,615
Here.

675
00:35:38,430 --> 00:35:41,279
Hello? Oh, it's me, huh?

676
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,876
Do you have a fever?

677
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:44,520
How much?

678
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:46,849
You probably caught a cold

679
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,755
Did you call a doctor?

680
00:35:50,474 --> 00:35:52,419
Well, anyway, I'll be home soon, so just rest

681
00:35:57,716 --> 00:35:59,070
Hmm, is someone unwell then?

682
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,710
Yes, it seems my wife has caught a cold

683
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,224
She says she has a fever of 38.5 degrees

684
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,456
I'm sorry, but...

685
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,236
Could you please do it next time?

686
00:36:07,261 --> 00:36:08,490
Yes, please do.

687
00:36:08,794 --> 00:36:10,484
I will treat you.

688
00:36:10,951 --> 00:36:11,896
Excuse me.

689
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,822
His wife is ill?

690
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:18,356
That's what he says

691
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,936
What kind of person is your teacher's wife?

692
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,474
I hear she's a very beautiful person

693
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:25,639
That sounds about right.

694
00:36:26,514 --> 00:36:27,592
But

695
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:29,644
But, what happened?

696
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,820
Well, there's a bit of a reason for that

697
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,849
I feel sorry for the teacher as well

698
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,826
This is a small amount

699
00:38:18,077 --> 00:38:19,841
They only accept half of it

700
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,740
It's going to sell out,

701
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,052
but I don't know why

702
00:38:23,271 --> 00:38:24,623
When it comes to that Nakayama

703
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,616
This kind of thing happens often Lately.

704
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,045
That's strange.

705
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:28,835
even French salad

706
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,556
I was pushed back halfway, you know

707
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:34,607
It's getting a bit hot and if I get pushed back, I won't have anything to throw away.

708
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:36,061
That's a problem.

709
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,349
It can't be helped

710
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:41,943
it suits you

711
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:46,463
Starting today, it's time
for a change of clothes.

712
00:38:46,731 --> 00:38:49,490
It's clean and very nice

713
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,052
I'm shy.

714
00:38:53,061 --> 00:38:54,561
What's going on with you?

715
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,980
Please go home early after handing out your work

716
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:58,865
Sorry.

717
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,396
Ah, you too.
Go home

718
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:08,685
I'm sorry

719
00:39:43,084 --> 00:39:43,577
Hi.

720
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:46,705
Is it break time now? Want to check out the dressing room?

721
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:50,301
It's interesting, Their facial expressions are like those of other people

722
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:52,333
You have a face like a beauty of the world, but in the dressing room...

723
00:39:52,358 --> 00:39:53,412
They eat a baked sweet potato

724
00:39:53,468 --> 00:39:55,255
Really?

725
00:39:55,654 --> 00:39:56,811
see you.

726
00:40:01,436 --> 00:40:02,654
Next please.

727
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,828
You're much more beautiful than the model

728
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,156
You are good at flattery

729
00:40:10,181 --> 00:40:10,803
Really.

730
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:15,537
I really do love you, I love you so much

731
00:40:15,709 --> 00:40:16,740
Sorry.

732
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,717
Welcome.

733
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,654
How much?

734
00:40:34,054 --> 00:40:35,107
Thank you very much.

735
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,279
French salad 200G

736
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:43,302
No, let's skip the French salad and go for meatballs instead

737
00:40:44,005 --> 00:40:45,005
What?

738
00:40:46,425 --> 00:40:47,449
What's the hell?

739
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,951
Do you dislike that?

740
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,316
Hey, what's wrong?

741
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:54,138
What's with that attitude towards the customer?

742
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,646
Call chief.

743
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:56,794
Yes, yes, yes

744
00:40:56,819 --> 00:40:57,732
Call chief.

745
00:40:58,271 --> 00:40:59,166
Yes, yes, I'm here, yes, yes, hey

746
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,646
What's wrong?

747
00:40:59,671 --> 00:41:00,561
I haven't done anything.

748
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,693
Your employees are very rude.

749
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,755
I can change the order

750
00:41:05,186 --> 00:41:06,287
I am the one who pays.

751
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,373
I'm sorry about that

752
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,021
You don't educate her enough.

753
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,474
Say your name

754
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,726
Fujita, you should apologize

755
00:41:14,751 --> 00:41:18,264
Come on, say something

756
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,380
I'm sorry..

757
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,434
Fujita

758
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,765
Is your name Fujita?

759
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,546
Her name is Setsuko Fujita

760
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:26,286
I've never seen such a stubborn girl

761
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,726
That's why the young people these days are no good

762
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,168
I sincerely apologize

763
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:31,806
Please ensure proper supervision going forward

764
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,356
I sincerely apologize

765
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:34,096
I apologize

766
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,226
I am very sorry

767
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:35,956
Thank you very much

768
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:38,176
Thank you very much

769
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,629
Why didn't you apologize?

770
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,536
I can't believe you managed to last until today with that

771
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,406
This is a issue about the entire Marutaka department store.

772
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:47,106
But, but I haven't done anything wrong

773
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,636
There's no such thing as bad or crap

774
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,446
That kind of attitude has been taken into consideration

775
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,236
What is it?

776
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,535
Basically, you're quite cheeky

777
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:01,582
Don't cry here.

778
00:42:01,684 --> 00:42:03,622
Get lost.

779
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,512
What are you doing?

780
00:42:07,537 --> 00:42:08,700
I’m sorry.

781
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:16,176
The customer started making excuses.

782
00:42:16,545 --> 00:42:19,545
And then, together with Nakayama-san, they get angry at Secchan

783
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,246
Right in front of everyone

784
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,476
Apologize or whatever

785
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,301
He cursed her harshly.

786
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:28,156
It's no surprise that Secchan can't hold back anymore with this

787
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,896
I wish everyone would just boycott that supervisor

788
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,646
As for the supervisor,

789
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,670
He doesn't like Setsu-chan getting along with the store clerk at the wholesaler

790
00:42:38,629 --> 00:42:39,575
You didn't know that?

791
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:41,946
So, he send back Mr. Takei's items

792
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,996
he treats you badly like he did earlier

793
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:49,379
It must be something unpleasant for the wholesaler and the female clerk to get along well

794
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,866
That's just how it is, isn't it?

795
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:57,113
In this Marutaka department store, the men here are of a lower status compared to the fishmongers

796
00:42:57,138 --> 00:42:58,777
It's an outdated feeling to say it's outrageous

797
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:02,259
I see, I had no idea.

798
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,266
If that's the case, Setchan, you too, going forward,

799
00:43:03,321 --> 00:43:06,934
It's a bit tough, isn't it? you have to pursue a love that crosses social classes,

800
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:09,622
but he's a good person

801
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,840
Setchan's partner

802
00:43:10,865 --> 00:43:12,223
Really?

803
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:15,512
Oh no, if I do this, I'll be accused again

804
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,696
Gofukubu is nice, isn't it?

805
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,720
The food department doesn't have time to be messing around

806
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,336
I somehow feel a surge of fighting spirit

807
00:43:24,309 --> 00:43:27,035
I'll fight against such outdated ways of thinking

808
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,090
That's the spirit!

809
00:43:29,772 --> 00:43:32,355
But you were dreaming of a romantic love

810
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:34,006
You've become quite realistic again

811
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:35,796
You've found love close to home, haven't you?

812
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,820
That's why I told you I like to take care of

813
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,686
It's such a backlash

814
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,457
But once I start stepping into real life and living,

815
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,226
there's no room for dreaming or longing

816
00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:48,739
It might be sad,

817
00:43:48,785 --> 00:43:52,387
 but that just means you've become an adult

818
00:43:53,387 --> 00:43:55,020
What do you think about your dating.

819
00:43:55,131 --> 00:43:56,448
It's not big deal.

820
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,005
Just for some reason

821
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:00,936
Seeing each other every day makes the wait feel so long

822
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:03,324
Looking forward to meeting again the next morning

823
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,653
It is a sign of the first phase of a perfect romance

824
00:44:05,678 --> 00:44:08,449
You're experiencing it too, even if you try to hide it, it's not working.

825
00:44:08,474 --> 00:44:10,559
with the teacher from the library.

826
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,699
That person has a wife, you know

827
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:18,941
I understand your feelings. if you were as smart and reliable as you are

828
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,559
Young men might be unreliable for you.

829
00:44:21,705 --> 00:44:24,973
All the good looking men over 30 are married.

830
00:44:25,083 --> 00:44:26,668
This is a dilemma.

831
00:44:27,294 --> 00:44:31,144
I don't understand; I want to work equally with men without losing out, but then again...

832
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:34,175
Women really have to get married, don't they?

833
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,348
I feel like I don't really understand true happiness

834
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:40,168
It's true, it's really a bit of a dilemma

835
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,246
Is Matsuno-kun not here?

836
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,016
Yes

837
00:44:44,553 --> 00:44:46,629
So you were here after all

838
00:44:47,465 --> 00:44:49,186
There is a customer who wants to meet you.

839
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,916
We were all searching for you together, you know

840
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,466
You're actually not very enthusiastic about work

841
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:54,846
Oh, I properly got the manager's permission

842
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:55,966
There's no such thing as permission

843
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,236
Leaving the sales floor for more than 40 minutes due to specifications is negligence of duty

844
00:44:58,260 --> 00:44:58,934
Hurry up.

845
00:44:59,075 --> 00:45:00,012
I'm going soon!

846
00:45:00,552 --> 00:45:02,818
He is neither the boss nor the chief.

847
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,036
I won't let someone like that scold me

848
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,426
That person always fights with you.

849
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:08,239
He's annoying.

850
00:45:08,434 --> 00:45:10,598
there's nothing we can do about it if they've taken a break for more than half an hour

851
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,506
It's true that you're the one at fault

852
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,530
Oh, I came to comfort you

853
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,020
I will work hard and confidently fall in love with Takei-san

854
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:20,466
What about that person?

855
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,816
Does he do his job properly?

856
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:24,535
It's frustrating, but I can't complain about it

857
00:45:25,046 --> 00:45:26,492
I won't lose to someone like that

858
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,346
It's that attitude that allows someone to make a claim

859
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:30,536
You need to fulfill your responsibilities completely first

860
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,946
Come on, cheer up!

861
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,793
It's like you suddenly became energetic

862
00:45:35,071 --> 00:45:38,071
It's almost as if I'm the one being comforted

863
00:46:00,049 --> 00:46:01,527
Let's leave.

864
00:46:02,161 --> 00:46:03,254
Are you excited?

865
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:04,551
A little bit

866
00:46:09,598 --> 00:46:12,364
wow that was amazing, kiss scene.

867
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:13,456
Where are we going?

868
00:46:13,574 --> 00:46:16,056
Dancing? Hey, or

869
00:46:16,081 --> 00:46:18,747
I don't want to, I'm going home

870
00:46:19,113 --> 00:46:23,043
Hey, can you not call me from now on?

871
00:46:23,417 --> 00:46:25,121
Huh? Why?

872
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,950
I want to end things with you today.

873
00:46:29,809 --> 00:46:31,153
Are you getting married?

874
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:33,895
I have too many boyfriends

875
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,146
Organize everything

876
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:39,170
I want to clearly decide on one person

877
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:42,680
In other words, that might be how it turns out

878
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,824
Well then, goodbye.

879
00:46:48,137 --> 00:46:49,325
Oh, I'm shocked.

880
00:47:02,864 --> 00:47:05,205
Thank you for visiting today

881
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,656
Let me introduce everyone

882
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:10,242
This is Mitani-kun, who will be taking care of us as a temporary staff member starting today

883
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:13,267
Thank you for your support and I look forward to working with you

884
00:47:14,110 --> 00:47:16,696
Thank you for visiting us today

885
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:18,276
Did manager say something to you?

886
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:19,836
There was a hair in foods

887
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:21,116
What?

888
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,656
We take hygiene very seriously

889
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,416
I said that couldn't be the case

890
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,886
I was thoroughly scolded for talking back

891
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,028
That's just harassment.

892
00:47:28,707 --> 00:47:30,660
They say there was some harassment from the customers at first, but...

893
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,806
It's not like I'm going to show that Letter

894
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,236
Even when I ask which food, they don't say anything specific

895
00:47:35,941 --> 00:47:38,260
It's terrible to make things up,

896
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:39,692
okay, I'll do it. I'm sorry

897
00:47:40,072 --> 00:47:41,543
Well then

898
00:47:43,387 --> 00:47:45,145
Takei-san. Please don't get discouraged

899
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:46,254
It's okay,

900
00:47:50,293 --> 00:47:51,918
I'll take two of this

901
00:47:52,145 --> 00:47:53,067
I'll have these two shiitake mushrooms

902
00:47:53,105 --> 00:47:54,756
Please wait a moment

903
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,496
Since those are fresh, please take care of them

904
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,226
Could you take a look at this for me?

905
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,556
Could you please hurry up with this?

906
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,326
Please take care of this

907
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:06,015
Do you think this would suit me?

908
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:06,816
That's the intention

909
00:48:07,527 --> 00:48:08,526
Thank you for waiting

910
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,719
Thank you!

911
00:48:09,941 --> 00:48:13,012
Wait, wait, what do you mean this is 5,500 yen?

912
00:48:13,509 --> 00:48:16,155
Last year when I bought it, it was over 10,000 yen

913
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:18,166
It seems like buying it early is a loss

914
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:19,576
Silk is a living thing

915
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:22,600
It has a lifespan, and if left alone, it will deteriorate

916
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:24,941
After one year passes,It can't be helped.

917
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:26,479
That's ridiculous.

918
00:48:27,122 --> 00:48:28,083
I'm sorry.

919
00:48:34,757 --> 00:48:37,757
Shall we go with that wrapping?

920
00:48:39,379 --> 00:48:40,696
Let me take a look a little longer

921
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,006
Please

922
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,356
I see, I will accompany you

923
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:14,209
That's enough, I don't have any other favorites

924
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:15,586
Please just this one

925
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,306
Yes, that will be 4500 yen

926
00:49:19,676 --> 00:49:20,497
Excuse me.

927
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:24,345
Well, there is a Dyeing around here

928
00:49:24,570 --> 00:49:27,406
If you could come again tomorrow,

929
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:30,036
I can prepare a better product for the same price,

930
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,250
What do you think?

931
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:35,316
Then please do that, I ask you

932
00:49:35,590 --> 00:49:36,684
Thank you for your continued support

933
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:43,696
I might be meddling again and get scolded

934
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:44,646
I've changed my opinion of you little

935
00:49:45,623 --> 00:49:49,020
Oh, when I noticed it, I tried to catch her right away, but I was surprised

936
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:50,496
You're so great.

937
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,066
I've also changed my opinion of you little

938
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:54,456
She tried to shoplift

939
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:57,463
I don't want to end up in a situation where I'm pushing something on her

940
00:49:57,550 --> 00:49:58,696
I am struck by your way of doing things

941
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,590
I've just taken one step forward

942
00:50:00,676 --> 00:50:02,708
so I guess we've improved a little

943
00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,196
So, I suppose this match ends in a draw, one-on-one

944
00:50:07,009 --> 00:50:10,009
Well, I'll let you have it, ah

945
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:16,527
That's right, next we have the electrical appliances, records, and beauty salon on the 7th floor.

946
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,836
I'm about to switch soon

947
00:50:19,860 --> 00:50:20,996
Well then, let's have some tea on the rooftop

948
00:50:21,021 --> 00:50:22,040
Okay

949
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,275
 thank you for waiting

950
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,236
Here's 7th floor

951
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:27,970
I'll be waiting for you

952
00:50:29,578 --> 00:50:30,827
Please

953
00:50:30,930 --> 00:50:33,181
Thank you for your hard work

954
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,646
Hey, do you want to eat ice cream?

955
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:37,976
Please eat

956
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,386
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

957
00:50:40,021 --> 00:50:42,410
Oh, Ryoko, could you come here for a moment?

958
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,116
Please, I'm begging you

959
00:50:44,638 --> 00:50:45,556
What's wrong?

960
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,136
I really want a one-hour break

961
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,896
So, can you keep riding in my place during the next break too?

962
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,236
For an hour straight?

963
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,676
I don't want to do that

964
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:56,700
For the next hour, I'll keep riding. It's not the same, right?

965
00:50:56,990 --> 00:50:59,990
I'm counting on you, okay?

966
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:01,579
It can't be helped. What's wrong?

967
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:04,704
What is it? Sayuri-chan has some casual clothes.

968
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,916
I took a break and asked for a change.

969
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:10,140
Well, just take a look, it's terrible.

970
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:14,580
Is she wearing nail polish?

971
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,681
Red is not allowed

972
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:20,230
She's so selfish,

973
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:22,625
 Sayuri-chan, You can't wear red nail polish.

974
00:51:22,650 --> 00:51:25,251
It's just during break time, so it's a nuisance, isn't it?

975
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,165
It's bad.

976
00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:29,001
We received a letter of complaint from a customer.

977
00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:30,603
It's generally too flashy

978
00:51:35,797 --> 00:51:37,134
Please.

979
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,155
let's treat you to some anmitsu at the cafeteria

980
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:43,596
That's fine

981
00:51:43,620 --> 00:51:44,986
You don't have to go that far

982
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:46,966
It's a world where everything is about service

983
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:47,595
Ah

984
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,036
I apologize for the inconvenience

985
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:52,197
I apologize for this inconvenience

986
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,509
Well then, go ahead

987
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:57,338
Secchan.

988
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:04,079
Sayuri-chan?

989
00:52:04,558 --> 00:52:05,540
Are you off today?

990
00:52:05,963 --> 00:52:08,220
I'm changing during my break and pretending to be a customer

991
00:52:08,536 --> 00:52:09,822
It would be a big deal if you got caught.

992
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:10,947
There's no way they'd figure it out.

993
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,086
I just ran into the manager on the fourth floor

994
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,407
He didn't notice

995
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,386
More importantly, what happened to you?

996
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:19,410
You've been doing something like gymnastics since earlier

997
00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:20,876
When I'm in the basement

998
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:23,536
I suddenly want to breathe the air on the rooftop

999
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,806
On top of that, I'm fighting right now, aren't I?

1000
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,017
Are you fighting?

1001
00:52:27,197 --> 00:52:28,145
In any workplace

1002
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:31,036
There are still old customs and social hierarchies, aren't there?

1003
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:33,566
I refuse to be defeated by such antiquity, even if it means death

1004
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,728
Well then, bye

1005
00:52:36,286 --> 00:52:38,042
She's in love right now

1006
00:52:38,729 --> 00:52:40,435
That's why she's so enthusiastic about it

1007
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,586
What about you?

1008
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,610
Me? I've broken up with all my boyfriends

1009
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:45,751
for you

1010
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:47,627
Poor men

1011
00:52:49,510 --> 00:52:50,611
Hey? Yeah?

1012
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,186
I don't know why, but

1013
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:54,196
I'm starting to not understand you a little bit

1014
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,189
What is it?

1015
00:52:55,690 --> 00:52:58,066
Because most boys, after they start dating,

1016
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,756
after a while, they ask for marriage

1017
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,286
He will definitely say it

1018
00:53:02,326 --> 00:53:03,501
But you know,

1019
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:05,799
ah, it's already summer, right?

1020
00:53:07,943 --> 00:53:09,947
It's a scorching summer

1021
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,908
, it's a blazing love

1022
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:15,431
It's a kiss of fire

1023
00:53:25,353 --> 00:53:26,501
Matsuno-kun! Huh?

1024
00:53:29,907 --> 00:53:30,681
Are you going home now?

1025
00:53:30,744 --> 00:53:31,314
Yes.

1026
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:32,725
Hey, could you hang out with me for a bit?

1027
00:53:32,930 --> 00:53:34,336
Actually, I want to make up

1028
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,360
Even though you're a woman....sorry

1029
00:53:37,406 --> 00:53:39,368
You really work hard, don't you?

1030
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,186
I just got a little fired up

1031
00:53:41,210 --> 00:53:43,376
I'm also igniting my fighting spirit for you

1032
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,400
In other words, even though you're a rookie, sorry...

1033
00:53:46,425 --> 00:53:48,245
You are a new employee but you work very hard.

1034
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:52,230
I have a bit of a scheduling conflict today

1035
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,256
Are you going on a date?

1036
00:53:53,281 --> 00:53:56,281
I'm busy every Wednesday.

1037
00:53:56,564 --> 00:53:59,002
so can we do it another time?

1038
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:00,696
Let's do that, then goodbye

1039
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:01,868
Goodbye

1040
00:54:04,119 --> 00:54:06,705
Today our worker actually brought a magazine to the sales floor

1041
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:08,106
I scolded her quite a bit

1042
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:12,243
But it's an amazing article, the sexual manifesto of rebellious single women

1043
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,126
The complete denial method cannot be tolerated by her

1044
00:54:15,150 --> 00:54:16,606
Have you read all of that?

1045
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:18,466
No, this is for educational purposes

1046
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,926
I just looked at the table of contents

1047
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:22,476
It's quite tough, isn't it?

1048
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:24,579
Managing young girls

1049
00:54:25,439 --> 00:54:26,822
She is quite flashy, isn't it?

1050
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:28,835
She's the girl known as Maki from the elevator

1051
00:54:28,860 --> 00:54:29,657
Is her nail red?

1052
00:54:29,682 --> 00:54:30,478
It's a nail polish

1053
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:32,603
Huh? There's a rumor about it.

1054
00:54:34,947 --> 00:54:35,845
I wonder where she's going.

1055
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:37,072
Well, of course it's a date

1056
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:38,367
When they reach a certain age

1057
00:54:38,430 --> 00:54:39,892
Are they going to date every night?

1058
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:40,876
When it's just one person

1059
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,282
There's no problem, but

1060
00:54:46,955 --> 00:54:47,933
She went into the pharmacy, right?

1061
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:50,416
I wonder what she went in to buy

1062
00:54:50,447 --> 00:54:52,072
I can't believe it's not a Contraceptives

1063
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:53,556
I think it might not be

1064
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,118
I have a responsibility to investigate this

1065
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:00,947
How about this?

1066
00:55:02,822 --> 00:55:04,236
I've never used this here, but does it work?

1067
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:05,526
It works really well

1068
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,686
I wonder if it can be wiped clean right away?

1069
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:07,130
Yes.

1070
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:09,775
Please give me some absorbent cotton

1071
00:55:10,470 --> 00:55:11,197
absorbent cotton?

1072
00:55:11,511 --> 00:55:14,066
The matter is serious, you know.

1073
00:55:16,283 --> 00:55:17,166
You

1074
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:18,548
Oh, manager

1075
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:19,900
what are you going to buy?

1076
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,036
Surely this isn't some inappropriate drug, right?

1077
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,516
This and absorbent cotton, right?

1078
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,314
What are you talking about?

1079
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,345
This is a nail polish remover

1080
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,940
Look, my nail polish is this dirty, isn't it?

1081
00:55:32,610 --> 00:55:34,040
That's why I thought I'd take it off

1082
00:55:34,822 --> 00:55:35,666
I'll need 200 yen

1083
00:55:36,818 --> 00:55:39,369
Are you feeling unwell?

1084
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,416
I'm so tired that I can't recover anymore

1085
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,907
Is that so?

1086
00:55:44,722 --> 00:55:45,954
He must be tired.

1087
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,187
Please introduce him to some good medicine.

1088
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:48,926
Well then, I'll go ahead

1089
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,026
Fatigue is not good

1090
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,384
Life should be enjoyed

1091
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,636
This means maintaining good health for a long time

1092
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:58,212
In other words, Health Lounge is full of energy, red and vibrant

1093
00:55:59,070 --> 00:55:59,587
How much?

1094
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:00,549
 3000 yen

1095
00:56:01,485 --> 00:56:02,626
Don't you have a smaller one?

1096
00:56:02,791 --> 00:56:04,002
We also have portable options.

1097
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,728
For 500 yen

1098
00:56:08,462 --> 00:56:09,650
I'll wrap it

1099
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:13,509
I bumped into a customer during the day and my clothes got stained with red nail polish.

1100
00:56:13,810 --> 00:56:16,466
Today, I really can't stand the red nail polish

1101
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:17,206
Who is it?

1102
00:56:17,230 --> 00:56:20,230
I can't believe it's so serious, but thank you for waiting

1103
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,796
At our department store, purchases are 10% off

1104
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:25,095
Thank you very much

1105
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,296
Okamoto Kanoko Hana is strong

1106
00:56:29,321 --> 00:56:30,088
the third.

1107
00:56:30,944 --> 00:56:32,478
This is Kimiko Matsuno

1108
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,635
If I walk through the town with a red flower in hand,

1109
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,650
There should be no fear of strength

1110
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:41,822
The practice based on the four sufferings written by my friend is

1111
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:43,741
Rather than including flowers,

1112
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:47,140
I desperately bit into the flowers and clung to them

1113
00:56:48,564 --> 00:56:50,095
It's hard

1114
00:56:51,043 --> 00:56:53,087
It's okay, even if I'm that bad?

1115
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:55,353
it's fine, it's fine. Everyone starts like that.

1116
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:57,486
Can I fix my accent?

1117
00:56:57,510 --> 00:56:59,276
I'm serious, what I mean is the accent

1118
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,954
It's about making it your own personality

1119
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,345
Thank you very much

1120
00:57:04,122 --> 00:57:05,642
Thank you

1121
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:07,439
Teacher.

1122
00:57:11,158 --> 00:57:12,017
I'm sorry about last day

1123
00:57:12,204 --> 00:57:13,455
How have you been, madam?

1124
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:14,798
Yes, she got better.

1125
00:57:16,814 --> 00:57:18,095
I am free tonight

1126
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,486
Shall we have a chat?

1127
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:22,579
Well, please

1128
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:37,048
I believe that progress is proportional
to how long the hesitation lasts

1129
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:43,376
So, Matsuno-san's recent worries are probably a sign of a big leap forward

1130
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:45,496
Don't rush

1131
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,520
It would be good to take your time and confront the true nature of your worries

1132
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:52,986
I have become completely confused

1133
00:57:54,127 --> 00:57:57,431
In such times, you try to listen to as many voices as possible

1134
00:57:57,669 --> 00:57:58,978
It's about listening to the radio

1135
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,681
I have students who say the same thing as you.

1136
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,541
could you meet him just once?

1137
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,432
Oh, I would love to meet him

1138
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:07,756
Who?

1139
00:58:07,812 --> 00:58:08,845
my wife

1140
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:11,406
If I talked about you...

1141
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,353
She says she really wants to meet you.

1142
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,156
How about it?

1143
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,595
Let's go to my apartment from here

1144
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:20,320
I will come

1145
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,657
Now, let's go

1146
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:23,806
Did you drink it?

1147
00:58:23,830 --> 00:58:25,134
Well, I already...

1148
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:30,767
What happened?

1149
00:58:37,887 --> 00:58:38,954
 hey, what's wrong?

1150
00:58:39,322 --> 00:58:40,556
Give me another shot.

1151
00:58:47,048 --> 00:58:50,306
I apologize for the inconvenience, but

1152
00:58:50,502 --> 00:58:51,353
I'm home.

1153
00:58:52,017 --> 00:58:53,962
we currently have a guest

1154
00:58:53,987 --> 00:58:54,681
Come in.

1155
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:00,689
Welcome.

1156
00:59:00,939 --> 00:59:02,861
Go ahead, please

1157
00:59:08,524 --> 00:59:10,055
Well then, this is wife.

1158
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:13,910
Here, this is Matsuno from Marutaka Department Store, whom I always talk about

1159
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:15,220
Nice to meet you

1160
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:16,783
thank you for coming

1161
00:59:17,212 --> 00:59:18,181
Have a seat.

1162
00:59:18,954 --> 00:59:20,603
let me make you some tea

1163
00:59:21,671 --> 00:59:22,707
That was just perfect

1164
00:59:22,770 --> 00:59:24,656
I was doing some voice recording

1165
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:25,776
Shall I let you listen?

1166
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,446
Oh, please do let me hear it

1167
00:59:27,470 --> 00:59:29,267
I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but

1168
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:31,634
Your tea is over here

1169
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,076
Lately, nothing seems to be going well for me

1170
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,220
Me too

1171
00:59:36,541 --> 00:59:38,564
I've already washed the pot in the sink.

1172
00:59:43,313 --> 00:59:47,173
the Air India flight from Calcutta lands in Hong Kong,

1173
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:49,396
due to weather conditions

1174
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:52,420
The final route to Tokyo from there will not be taken

1175
00:59:53,628 --> 00:59:55,337
I wonder if the author is being a bit too modest

1176
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,790
Your way of acting like you've got it all together is showing too much on the surface

1177
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:01,347
You think so?

1178
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:05,425
I wonder if that's true; until recently, I was being too dramatic

1179
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,496
I'm becoming too much like a noble

1180
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,326
And then, I should stand a little more modestly

1181
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,350
I'm really sorry for not being able to get into the groove at all

1182
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,167
I'll handle it.

1183
01:00:15,198 --> 01:00:17,200
That's fine, I'm used to it.

1184
01:00:17,362 --> 01:00:18,382
since the time we got married

1185
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,146
When this person starts doing it,

1186
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:22,716
I felt bad and helped out, but...

1187
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,386
These days, I've decided not to worry about it

1188
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:28,961
Oh, is that so?

1189
01:00:37,356 --> 01:00:41,129
Could you please let me know if you notice anything?

1190
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:44,086
Oh, I can't critique people.

1191
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,845
Because My husband tells me you are wonderful.

1192
01:00:47,242 --> 01:00:48,475
No way.

1193
01:00:49,032 --> 01:00:52,032
I really don't understand this at all, and it's quite troubling

1194
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:56,564
Well, if you overdo it, it's too much; if you hold back too much.

1195
01:00:57,270 --> 01:00:59,355
There's only way to keep going back and forth like that

1196
01:01:00,293 --> 01:01:04,399
Eventually, I think you'll create something that fits your style.

1197
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:07,960
I'm really sorry for the trouble.

1198
01:01:08,397 --> 01:01:09,570
especially since you came all this way

1199
01:01:09,730 --> 01:01:10,946
I'm sorry for making you listen to something so poorly done

1200
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,334
No, not at all

1201
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:14,439
Would you like a drink?

1202
01:01:14,643 --> 01:01:16,170
Oh, that's great!

1203
01:01:16,997 --> 01:01:17,864
Matsuno can drink too.

1204
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:19,223
Oh,Don't worry.

1205
01:01:19,587 --> 01:01:21,705
Oh, then shall I add some whiskey?

1206
01:01:21,730 --> 01:01:22,816
Oh, that sounds good

1207
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,192
Oh, that's right, there's some water over here.

1208
01:01:36,494 --> 01:01:37,330
You want some water?

1209
01:01:37,509 --> 01:01:38,259
Oh, I'll go get it.

1210
01:01:38,424 --> 01:01:39,252
Don't worry.

1211
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,260
She's been doing that since she was a kid

1212
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,876
But surprisingly, she is quite okay with it

1213
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,079
I've gotten used to her too

1214
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,095
It's been 5 years since we got married

1215
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,306
Was she a student of you?

1216
01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:01,330
Yes, she showed up at the lab.

1217
01:02:02,462 --> 01:02:05,462
I was surprised when you said you wanted to help the people of blind.

1218
01:02:09,681 --> 01:02:11,080
Here it is.

1219
01:02:13,478 --> 01:02:15,374
I was born with these legs

1220
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:20,243
Since I was small, I believed I was the most unfortunate person in the world.

1221
01:02:21,533 --> 01:02:22,783
Would you like some cheese?

1222
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:24,993
Ah, I'll go cut it

1223
01:02:28,118 --> 01:02:31,454
There were times when I resented my parents and envied the world

1224
01:02:32,642 --> 01:02:34,556
However, in some magazine...

1225
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:43,032
I realized how much more unfortunate those who are blind are compared to someone like me

1226
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:48,751
I felt as if I had awakened from a long period of confusion

1227
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,892
And then I flew to the library.

1228
01:02:55,290 --> 01:02:56,720
Well, it's a nice story

1229
01:02:58,130 --> 01:03:00,212
Is it a love marriage with the teacher?

1230
01:03:02,205 --> 01:03:03,978
It was not like that.

1231
01:03:04,345 --> 01:03:09,657
It was a romance between a couple with a disabled spouse and an unknown voice actor

1232
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,350
I guess it's called helping each other when people have the same opinions about life

1233
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:17,650
I've completely relied on this person because of this

1234
01:03:18,355 --> 01:03:21,021
I want to do well even just with this job

1235
01:03:22,030 --> 01:03:24,064
It's quite difficult, isn't it?

1236
01:03:25,245 --> 01:03:27,290
I'm glad I could drop by today

1237
01:03:27,439 --> 01:03:28,275
is that so?

1238
01:03:28,820 --> 01:03:31,243
I feel like I've also cooled down from my confusion

1239
01:03:31,798 --> 01:03:33,048
What are you hesitating about?

1240
01:03:33,910 --> 01:03:38,228
Both work-related doubts and
life doubts surround me All doubts

1241
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,358
It's like you're speaking as if you were the Buddha

1242
01:03:43,049 --> 01:03:44,392
so let's not toast

1243
01:03:44,655 --> 01:03:45,642
Well, I will take this

1244
01:03:45,869 --> 01:03:46,814
I will take this.

1245
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:53,156
I hope that Matsuno's life is filled with happiness

1246
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:55,884
for the beautiful couple of you

1247
01:03:55,909 --> 01:03:56,595
Thank you

1248
01:03:57,088 --> 01:03:58,345
cheers

1249
01:04:01,220 --> 01:04:03,205
Hey,What's wrong?

1250
01:04:03,705 --> 01:04:05,306
Why are you laughing?

1251
01:04:06,111 --> 01:04:07,064
My nail

1252
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:09,136
Section chief

1253
01:04:09,160 --> 01:04:10,431
Liver medicine

1254
01:04:10,564 --> 01:04:11,345
What do you mean?

1255
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:13,226
Is that some kind of three-generation story?

1256
01:04:13,673 --> 01:04:14,846
She is drunk

1257
01:04:15,696 --> 01:04:17,071
It's the mastermind

1258
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:19,564
Yes I am.

1259
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:20,494
That's good.

1260
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:24,206
I have something I want to say after drinking

1261
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,716
Alright, let's listen

1262
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:26,676
But first, let's make a toast

1263
01:04:27,511 --> 01:04:28,228
Okay

1264
01:04:33,822 --> 01:04:34,799
Make another one.

1265
01:04:35,191 --> 01:04:35,782
Are you okay?

1266
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:36,482
I'm fine

1267
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:37,956
Then make it

1268
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:41,505
Mr. Hata

1269
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:43,196
What do you think of me?

1270
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,316
I like you, you're cute

1271
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:46,896
Really?

1272
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,145
You're getting along.

1273
01:04:48,863 --> 01:04:50,533
I'll get lost.

1274
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:57,329
Hey, are you teasing me?

1275
01:04:57,622 --> 01:04:59,775
You're so drunk.

1276
01:05:01,646 --> 01:05:02,612
I'm fine

1277
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:03,713
Not a problem

1278
01:05:03,820 --> 01:05:05,180
Then let's stand up.

1279
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,781
Look

1280
01:05:08,841 --> 01:05:10,307
I'm sorry.

1281
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:15,242
Do you really like me?

1282
01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:17,897
I want to eat you up

1283
01:05:32,499 --> 01:05:33,792
so let's get married.

1284
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,582
Alright, then tonight is the wedding

1285
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,520
Driver, please take us to Yokohama.

1286
01:05:41,147 --> 01:05:42,167
You won't regret it?

1287
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:46,630
Alright, I'll go as far as I can, you know

1288
01:05:47,013 --> 01:05:48,314
Because I like you.

1289
01:06:41,156 --> 01:06:42,136
Hey, I love you

1290
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:49,825
Is it okay if I tell everyone that I'm marrying you?

1291
01:06:50,110 --> 01:06:50,806
I don't mind

1292
01:06:52,012 --> 01:06:53,830
I'm happy

1293
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,865
I'm sure everyone will laugh

1294
01:06:57,395 --> 01:06:58,002
Why?

1295
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:00,412
I have a wife.

1296
01:07:04,684 --> 01:07:07,130
You were lying, weren't you? You deceived me

1297
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:08,716
I didn't say I'm single.

1298
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:09,907
Then marry me

1299
01:07:09,987 --> 01:07:11,167
I have a wife.

1300
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,318
Break up.

1301
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:14,631
we have kids too

1302
01:07:15,763 --> 01:07:16,389
Child?

1303
01:07:17,115 --> 01:07:19,084
I told my wife not to birth

1304
01:07:19,109 --> 01:07:20,524
My wife just stepped on it without permission

1305
01:07:21,690 --> 01:07:23,258
Next year, they're going to elementary school

1306
01:07:24,818 --> 01:07:26,525
Get out, get out!

1307
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,292
I don't wanna see your face anymore.

1308
01:07:28,317 --> 01:07:30,194
If we leave now, we can make it in time

1309
01:07:30,219 --> 01:07:31,252
Get out.

1310
01:07:34,102 --> 01:07:35,242
Well then, I guess I'll take my leave

1311
01:07:37,148 --> 01:07:39,403
Then I'll take care of the bill

1312
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:49,619
Wait for me, Hata-san

1313
01:08:08,303 --> 01:08:10,856
Marriage is boring.

1314
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:13,733
Stay like that.
It's more fun.

1315
01:08:37,002 --> 01:08:38,685
Takei-san, what a fool

1316
01:08:38,710 --> 01:08:40,796
If you like someone, you should just say so

1317
01:08:40,820 --> 01:08:42,456
But there's nothing we can do about it

1318
01:08:42,487 --> 01:08:43,910
In the atmosphere of our sales floor.

1319
01:08:44,664 --> 01:08:48,544
I don't have any grand hopes.

1320
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:52,029
I just want to grasp a tiny bit of happiness

1321
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:54,740
But isn't that the most difficult thing of all?

1322
01:08:55,110 --> 01:08:56,855
I really think so just like this

1323
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,230
How about you?

1324
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:04,038
I liked him even more after learning that his wife has a bad leg

1325
01:09:04,710 --> 01:09:06,446
But I no longer have any ambitions

1326
01:09:06,470 --> 01:09:07,564
Have you given up?

1327
01:09:08,010 --> 01:09:11,818
Rather than saying I've given up, I want to gently cherish those feelings

1328
01:09:12,930 --> 01:09:14,296
It was a good experience

1329
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:17,116
I feel like my life has become a bit deeper

1330
01:09:17,140 --> 01:09:18,756
How about the rookie?

1331
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:21,646
We did reach a sort of reconciliation, though

1332
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:24,196
I got caught drinking beer with Mr. Tsuruoka.

1333
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:26,567
He seems to be sulking and isn't talking to me

1334
01:09:27,242 --> 01:09:29,215
so there's no need to make excuses.I'll just leave him be

1335
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,820
So, he finally fell in love with you, huh?

1336
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:34,686
Is that so?

1337
01:09:34,710 --> 01:09:37,710
Of course, it's definitely jealousy.

1338
01:09:40,665 --> 01:09:41,772
What's wrong?

1339
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:03,362
Who is the man?

1340
01:10:03,604 --> 01:10:05,081
Isn't that someone from the marketing department?

1341
01:10:06,015 --> 01:10:07,916
That looks fun

1342
01:10:08,526 --> 01:10:09,362
Are you jealous?

1343
01:10:16,205 --> 01:10:17,501
Aren't you going to swim?

1344
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,016
I'm no good at this

1345
01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:19,834
Why?

1346
01:10:19,987 --> 01:10:21,276
She can't swim

1347
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,940
Then why did you come?

1348
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:24,336
Is it not okay to come?

1349
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:27,573
I didn't say it was not okay, how about swimming?

1350
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,674
Huh? Well then, I'll go swim and do some reconnaissance

1351
01:10:33,699 --> 01:10:34,331
Don't do that.

1352
01:10:34,356 --> 01:10:35,190
Leave it to me.

1353
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:38,870
Are you going home?

1354
01:10:41,674 --> 01:10:42,527
Did you mark it? Oh, what's wrong?

1355
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:44,965
Oh, aren't you going to swim, section chief?

1356
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:46,436
I can't swim, you know

1357
01:10:46,460 --> 01:10:49,460
Oh, so you're not swimming either, just like me?

1358
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:51,105
You can't either?

1359
01:10:52,677 --> 01:10:53,777
What about you, Ubukata-kun?

1360
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:56,286
He's swimming

1361
01:10:56,310 --> 01:10:58,246
You weren't together?

1362
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,432
Why is that?

1363
01:11:00,120 --> 01:11:01,706
You see, Ubukata-kun...

1364
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,536
He's praising you

1365
01:11:03,561 --> 01:11:05,912
He said that you did well for a woman

1366
01:11:05,937 --> 01:11:08,270
Please tell Ubukata that

1367
01:11:08,693 --> 01:11:12,364
I absolutely hate the phrase 'for a woman' more than anything in this world

1368
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,885
Well, this is rude, but I should say it clearly

1369
01:11:17,970 --> 01:11:21,775
Well, since both of you are well-regular employees, I hope you can get along as much as possible

1370
01:11:22,830 --> 01:11:26,330
Or maybe Ubuakata-kun already feels like you are good friends in his heart.

1371
01:11:27,340 --> 01:11:30,340
This is just a feeling based on years of experience.

1372
01:11:42,783 --> 01:11:43,529
 Are you okay?

1373
01:11:43,629 --> 01:11:45,209
No, it's nothing serious

1374
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:48,016
Oh, it's you, Ubukata-kun

1375
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:48,616
What's wrong?

1376
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,182
He got stung by a jellyfish

1377
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,762
Oh, could you bring me some water?

1378
01:11:54,188 --> 01:11:55,055
Is it really that bad?

1379
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,626
No, it's just a little swollen

1380
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:58,026
Did you get stung by a jellyfish?

1381
01:11:58,050 --> 01:12:00,596
Look, it's so red and swollen, does it hurt?

1382
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:01,097
Water, water.

1383
01:12:01,162 --> 01:12:04,285
Oh no, this is terrible. Kikko, please cool it down.

1384
01:12:04,762 --> 01:12:07,682
Everyone, let's leave this to Kinko and go swimming.

1385
01:12:07,839 --> 01:12:10,656
we do that, then, Mazuro, I'll leave it to you

1386
01:12:12,676 --> 01:12:13,487
I'll take care of it.

1387
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:14,247
No.

1388
01:12:14,285 --> 01:12:14,840
Come on.

1389
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry

1390
01:12:18,372 --> 01:12:19,549
No, it's okay.

1391
01:12:22,959 --> 01:12:24,046
I heard from Fujita-kun

1392
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,616
I heard you had someone you liked

1393
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:27,180
Yes.

1394
01:12:27,273 --> 01:12:29,328
it's the person from the other day?

1395
01:12:29,690 --> 01:12:31,136
I heard he has a wife

1396
01:12:31,160 --> 01:12:31,925
Yes

1397
01:12:32,659 --> 01:12:33,593
I heard you gave up, right?

1398
01:12:35,396 --> 01:12:38,396
No.
I've come to respect him more and like him even more

1399
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:42,951
Oh, are you angry again?

1400
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,502
No, that's quite different from what I heard.

1401
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:48,576
But I've really come to like Ubukata-san a lot

1402
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,482
Really?

1403
01:12:49,947 --> 01:12:50,706
Do you want to drink ?

1404
01:12:52,151 --> 01:12:54,855
let's get along from now on

1405
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,230
We'll compete fiercely.
 there's no way I'll lose to you.

1406
01:12:58,604 --> 01:13:00,744
I'm going to do my best, and I won't lose either

1407
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:03,813
To make up

1408
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:05,820
Don't use the word for women

1409
01:13:05,999 --> 01:13:08,999
I won't say that.
I acknowledge your abilities

1410
01:13:09,670 --> 01:13:10,492
Cheers!

1411
01:13:16,854 --> 01:13:19,009
By the way, what does that person do?

1412
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:22,220
Oh, didn't you ask Secchan?

1413
01:13:23,680 --> 01:13:26,680
Well then, let's not talk about that for a while

1414
01:13:26,810 --> 01:13:28,236
Let me know when the time comes to talk about it

1415
01:13:29,954 --> 01:13:30,704
promise me

1416
01:13:31,775 --> 01:13:33,275
I will promise you.

1417
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:40,316
How is it? Feels good, right?

1418
01:13:40,943 --> 01:13:43,286
if you had just let me do it from the start, it wouldn't have been a big deal

1419
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:44,564
Really.

1420
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:53,913
Hey, Mitani

1421
01:13:54,422 --> 01:13:55,175
what are you doing?

1422
01:13:55,543 --> 01:13:58,543
I'm making that 100-gram package

1423
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:01,600
Look closely, isn't there two pieces?

1424
01:14:02,264 --> 01:14:03,490
That's a problem

1425
01:14:03,515 --> 01:14:04,318
I'm sorry

1426
01:14:04,390 --> 01:14:06,316
Do you know how many grams this weighs?

1427
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:06,853
I have no idea.

1428
01:14:06,878 --> 01:14:07,860
Check it.

1429
01:14:08,391 --> 01:14:09,772
it's not just one piece, it's a whole set.

1430
01:14:11,347 --> 01:14:11,867
What's wrong?

1431
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,186
She's wasting the slip.

1432
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:13,774
How much?

1433
01:14:13,860 --> 01:14:14,906
It's 105 grams

1434
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,097
How many pairs?

1435
01:14:16,211 --> 01:14:17,024
There are 30 pairs

1436
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,676
You can have 30 pairs each day

1437
01:14:18,700 --> 01:14:19,986
If you overuse our slip,

1438
01:14:20,010 --> 01:14:21,715
Confirming 105 grams is not accounted for,

1439
01:14:22,060 --> 01:14:22,936
If you continue that for a year,

1440
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:24,379
How much loss will we incur?

1441
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:24,920
I'm sorry.

1442
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:25,905
If you use our slip too much,

1443
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:28,930
It's not a good idea to think about making a profit from it.

1444
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:32,399
Director...Don't say like that

1445
01:14:38,341 --> 01:14:40,501
please cut it out, Nakayama

1446
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:41,143
What?

1447
01:14:41,168 --> 01:14:42,763
That's just too much.

1448
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:45,346
She just did it carelessly, that's all

1449
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:47,126
Can't you tell just by looking at that much?

1450
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:48,236
Isn't it okay not to raise your voice?

1451
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:50,574
Does Mr. Nakayama have some grudge against our company?

1452
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:53,079
If you have any complaints, please say

1453
01:14:53,117 --> 01:14:55,537
I have a lot to say to you

1454
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:57,315
Bring Department cheif.

1455
01:15:02,030 --> 01:15:04,275
Mitani-san, please stop crying.

1456
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,036
Come on, Mitani-kun, it's okay, it's okay

1457
01:15:06,060 --> 01:15:07,426
Cheer up, okay?

1458
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:09,256
Alright, let's go, okay?

1459
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,093
I'm sorry.

1460
01:15:10,406 --> 01:15:11,281
Don't worry.

1461
01:15:11,586 --> 01:15:12,797
I'm sorry.

1462
01:15:13,102 --> 01:15:14,375
Let's go.

1463
01:15:15,245 --> 01:15:16,429
Takei-san

1464
01:15:17,422 --> 01:15:19,766
Aren't you coming anymore?

1465
01:15:20,360 --> 01:15:22,536
Maybe even if I wanted to come, I can't

1466
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,242
Thank you all for your support for a long time.

1467
01:15:28,192 --> 01:15:31,008
Well then, let's go

1468
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:39,226
Alright, that's fine

1469
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:44,492
Setchan, boss is watching you

1470
01:15:46,220 --> 01:15:47,281
Setchan

1471
01:15:54,953 --> 01:15:57,075
So, did that person get fired?

1472
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,616
The next day, the executive of Ootomiya

1473
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:01,366
He brought another staff member

1474
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,856
He bowed to Chief Nakayama and introduced him.

1475
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,886
So, are you planning to give up on that person?

1476
01:16:05,910 --> 01:16:06,914
That's not it!

1477
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,390
So what should I do?

1478
01:16:08,874 --> 01:16:11,453
That's why I'm consulting you, who has rich experience, right?

1479
01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:13,236
Just take action and do it

1480
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:14,390
In what way?

1481
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:15,516
Make a phone call

1482
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:16,601
From the woman?

1483
01:16:16,970 --> 01:16:20,617
That's right, anyway, you should find out what the other person thinks of you

1484
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,132
If he doesn't think much of it

1485
01:16:22,157 --> 01:16:23,253
You should organize it

1486
01:16:23,630 --> 01:16:24,656
Now, hurry up and make that call

1487
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:25,966
Wait, now?

1488
01:16:25,991 --> 01:16:27,039
Yeah.

1489
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,568
I'm still eating soba.

1490
01:16:28,593 --> 01:16:30,359
It's not important.

1491
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,526
Come on, hurry up!

1492
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,160
It's the time when your life will be decided, you know

1493
01:16:34,308 --> 01:16:34,835
Yeah.

1494
01:16:37,668 --> 01:16:38,295
Oh, is it already done?

1495
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:38,756
not yet

1496
01:16:38,780 --> 01:16:39,346
That spot is free

1497
01:16:39,561 --> 01:16:40,248
I see.

1498
01:16:40,674 --> 01:16:42,447
Um? Sorry, hello there!

1499
01:16:42,871 --> 01:16:43,998
Here.

1500
01:16:46,011 --> 01:16:47,335
You look so happy, don't you?

1501
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,736
You have a familiar face

1502
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,596
Is that so? I'm hungry, though

1503
01:16:50,620 --> 01:16:52,296
Did you see this?

1504
01:16:52,321 --> 01:16:53,046
What?

1505
01:16:53,869 --> 01:16:56,120
It's the brochure for the Conference,

1506
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,186
Already talking about autumn?

1507
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:03,210
Well, I'm already 22 this autumn.

1508
01:17:03,963 --> 01:17:05,625
They are a whole new design and layout

1509
01:17:05,650 --> 01:17:06,731
They have a good reputation.

1510
01:17:06,756 --> 01:17:08,663
So what?

1511
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:12,910
This was designed by Hata, right? From the advertising department.

1512
01:17:14,447 --> 01:17:15,327
Is that so?

1513
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:18,828
Yeah, it looks good. You have a great sense of style.

1514
01:17:19,348 --> 01:17:20,988
When are you getting married?

1515
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:22,436
With Hata

1516
01:17:23,329 --> 01:17:25,276
does that mean I have to get married?

1517
01:17:25,775 --> 01:17:26,788
For sure

1518
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,138
If I can enjoy my youth

1519
01:17:29,163 --> 01:17:30,596
That's enough for me now

1520
01:17:31,140 --> 01:17:31,766
What's wrong?

1521
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:32,695
Did you talk?

1522
01:17:32,849 --> 01:17:34,429
He wasn't there.

1523
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,765
Oh no.

1524
01:17:36,156 --> 01:17:39,156
Well, it's now 6 o'clock, time to close

1525
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:43,670
We look forward to your visit again tomorrow

1526
01:17:44,433 --> 01:17:48,006
Thank you, thank you.

1527
01:17:50,697 --> 01:17:52,610
By the way,

1528
01:17:52,635 --> 01:17:55,614
Yes, we do. I'm sorry about that

1529
01:17:56,809 --> 01:17:58,355
I’m sorry.

1530
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:00,678
How much?

1531
01:18:00,787 --> 01:18:02,603
It's a 10% discount off 700 yen

1532
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:04,199
The register is already closed.

1533
01:18:04,493 --> 01:18:05,626
so I'll just leave the money with you

1534
01:18:05,651 --> 01:18:06,811
Is that so?

1535
01:18:07,032 --> 01:18:07,705
 Oh, that's fine

1536
01:18:08,553 --> 01:18:09,249
Thank you very much

1537
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:10,195
You're welcome.

1538
01:18:14,387 --> 01:18:14,967
hey you?

1539
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:17,362
Where did you take this?

1540
01:18:17,501 --> 01:18:18,972
I bought this book at the bookstore

1541
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:20,439
Let me see it

1542
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:22,306
Why isn't it wrapped?

1543
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,376
I said it's fine as it is because I'm in a hurry

1544
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:25,526
Where is the purchase receipt?

1545
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:26,726
The register was closed

1546
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,106
I just left the money

1547
01:18:28,130 --> 01:18:29,396
Let's ask them.

1548
01:18:29,420 --> 01:18:30,946
Come.

1549
01:18:30,971 --> 01:18:31,722
OK

1550
01:18:33,748 --> 01:18:35,063
the book department

1551
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:37,000
It's not like stealing this book is a big deal

1552
01:18:37,025 --> 01:18:38,716
I can't help it, why can't people be trusted like that?

1553
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:40,686
I wonder if everyone has gone home

1554
01:18:40,710 --> 01:18:42,046
Anyway

1555
01:18:43,398 --> 01:18:45,272
I'll take care of this book

1556
01:18:45,356 --> 01:18:46,522
it's a bit troublesome

1557
01:18:46,689 --> 01:18:49,557
I am doing tape recordings for blind people.

1558
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:51,466
Starting today, I will be reading Tanizaki's Genji

1559
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:52,322
Is it part-time work

1560
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:53,605
It's social conservatism.

1561
01:18:53,630 --> 01:18:54,369
It's free

1562
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,616
To use the recording studio, there is a schedule

1563
01:18:57,640 --> 01:18:58,630
I have to go by 7 PM tonight

1564
01:18:58,655 --> 01:18:59,557
for any reason

1565
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:00,626
Rules are rules, you know

1566
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:01,566
I can't give you this book

1567
01:19:01,590 --> 01:19:02,477
What's your name?

1568
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:04,972
Please tell me your name

1569
01:19:05,466 --> 01:19:06,359
Matsuno Kimiko

1570
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:09,523
 thank you for your hard work

1571
01:19:15,596 --> 01:19:17,805
Matsuno-kun, what's wrong?

1572
01:19:17,830 --> 01:19:18,884
You were quite late, weren't you?

1573
01:19:18,922 --> 01:19:20,424
I got caught by the security staff.

1574
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:21,806
By the security staff?

1575
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:25,806
I bought a book and didn't wrap it, so I was suspicious.

1576
01:19:25,990 --> 01:19:26,946
He's making fun of me

1577
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,826
If that happens, there's nothing we can do about it

1578
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,516
That's their job, after all

1579
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:31,637
Shall we grab a meal?

1580
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:33,445
Will you treat me?

1581
01:19:33,640 --> 01:19:36,036
Well, sorry, but please pay on a taxi with that money

1582
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:37,005
Could you take me to Shinjuku?

1583
01:19:37,285 --> 01:19:38,145
To the library?

1584
01:19:38,510 --> 01:19:40,786
Huh? How do you know that?

1585
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:42,196
I heard it from Fujita-kun

1586
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,539
Come on, let's hurry up

1587
01:19:47,304 --> 01:19:49,411
We made a promise that doesn't hold anything back.

1588
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,756
If there's even one thing I don't understand about you,

1589
01:19:51,780 --> 01:19:53,046
It can no longer be left as it is

1590
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:56,056
I'm impressed

1591
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:57,341
I knew it was you after all

1592
01:19:57,900 --> 01:19:59,920
And the sense of competition has become even stronger

1593
01:20:01,676 --> 01:20:03,332
Ah, driver, please turn at the next corner

1594
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,651
Oh, teacher

1595
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:14,132
Good evening.

1596
01:20:19,043 --> 01:20:19,730
He?

1597
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,476
Yeah, I've said it many times, but

1598
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:24,136
I really love him.

1599
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:26,530
But more than that, I've come to like your wife

1600
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:28,086
I feel embarrassed.

1601
01:20:28,116 --> 01:20:31,630
I guess it's like how female students admire their high school teachers.

1602
01:20:32,088 --> 01:20:33,415
It's not like that.

1603
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:37,567
But it's true that I've become somewhat immune to love and stronger in life, so well then

1604
01:20:38,059 --> 01:20:38,988
Thank you very much

1605
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,047
Ubukata,

1606
01:20:42,743 --> 01:20:46,902
 I've been feeling great lately Life is really enjoyable because I'm thinking of working with you as equals

1607
01:20:46,990 --> 01:20:49,121
I have a strong sense of competition

1608
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,496
Could you give me that?

1609
01:20:58,458 --> 01:20:59,432
please wait a moment

1610
01:21:03,374 --> 01:21:05,401
Please wait a moment.

1611
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,880
Setchan, phone call.

1612
01:21:10,147 --> 01:21:11,300
I'm sorry

1613
01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:15,441
From who?

1614
01:21:15,653 --> 01:21:16,789
Are you getting married next month?

1615
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:18,782
Yes, congratulations.

1616
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:20,895
Hello, this is Fujita

1617
01:21:21,867 --> 01:21:23,487
Huh? Takei?

1618
01:21:24,931 --> 01:21:26,018
Is that you, Takei-san?

1619
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:30,796
Yes, next, next, next, this is okay, right?

1620
01:21:30,983 --> 01:21:33,588
Yes, next, yes, next, yes, this is okay, yes, next

1621
01:21:34,332 --> 01:21:36,165
I will deliver it right away once it's ready

1622
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,026
Please

1623
01:21:37,050 --> 01:21:38,829
Thank you very much

1624
01:21:52,485 --> 01:21:54,424
I was scolded a lot

1625
01:21:54,518 --> 01:21:57,213
As you said, I was wrong too.

1626
01:21:58,033 --> 01:22:01,151
The reason companies don't trust their female employees is because there are problems with them.

1627
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:02,291
Why?

1628
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:07,057
Women tend to quit work as soon as they get married and are not enthusiastic about their work.

1629
01:22:07,463 --> 01:22:10,096
You are making fun of women again.

1630
01:22:10,440 --> 01:22:13,299
Of course you are the exception.

1631
01:22:13,776 --> 01:22:15,393
I forgive you

1632
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:19,494
What's going on with you?

1633
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:24,783
Ah! While being too unfriendly is a problem, being too friendly is also not good

1634
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:25,564
Huh?

1635
01:22:26,163 --> 01:22:28,944
But you know, times have changed

1636
01:22:29,470 --> 01:22:32,470
Actually, I also fell in love and got married to my wife at this department store

1637
01:22:33,350 --> 01:22:36,350
I was looked at with disdain by everyone

1638
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:39,156
Well, if it's a healthy relationship now,

1639
01:22:39,180 --> 01:22:41,006
no one will blame you for it, right?

1640
01:22:41,030 --> 01:22:43,152
So please make sure to do it properly

1641
01:22:49,002 --> 01:22:52,206
Manager think of us like a lover.

1642
01:22:52,443 --> 01:22:54,445
I think so too

1643
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,587
It's still early

1644
01:23:11,285 --> 01:23:12,726
I'm sorry for being late

1645
01:23:13,357 --> 01:23:15,043
It's really crowded, you know

1646
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,956
I went back here from Ikebukuro in just one day

1647
01:23:17,980 --> 01:23:19,085
Ikebukuro?

1648
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:21,400
I'm currently being sent to a department store in Ikebukuro

1649
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:24,935
So, it's a demotion, isn't it?

1650
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:27,056
I messed up at Marutaka Department Store

1651
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,917
That's just too much, I'm really sorry

1652
01:23:30,256 --> 01:23:32,445
I also have some responsibility in this matter

1653
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:37,074
No, that's not it. More importantly, I actually have something important to talk about

1654
01:23:38,140 --> 01:23:38,773
What?

1655
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:40,587
Anyway, let's eat something

1656
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:42,557
Please eat what you like

1657
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:44,406
I withdrew some savings today, so

1658
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,442
I'm fine, really.

1659
01:23:45,610 --> 01:23:47,363
 I don't like luxury

1660
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:51,605
Then let's take advantage of this kind offer and go somewhere that suits us

1661
01:23:51,630 --> 01:23:52,858
A modest place

1662
01:23:57,712 --> 01:23:58,826
Here it is.

1663
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:04,456
I remember the picnic from some time ago

1664
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,386
Ina-san will marry next month, right?

1665
01:24:06,410 --> 01:24:08,086
I heard she's quitting today only

1666
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:09,226
What about Obara-san and Nami-san?

1667
01:24:09,250 --> 01:24:10,296
Getting hotter and hotter

1668
01:24:10,320 --> 01:24:12,466
It feels like they are on fire.

1669
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:14,254
Do you miss them?

1670
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:17,640
Well, this isn't something to talk about while stuffing my face with rice balls

1671
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,086
I had something to say too

1672
01:24:20,111 --> 01:24:22,215
But I'll wait until I hear your story.

1673
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:24,913
I'm curious, please tell me, Fujita-san

1674
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:28,376
It's not something to talk about while eating rice balls, but

1675
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,066
But I'll talk.

1676
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:30,956
It's good because it's realistic

1677
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,980
I liked you, Takei-san

1678
01:24:34,470 --> 01:24:36,249
I liked you so much that I couldn't help it

1679
01:24:36,649 --> 01:24:38,209
Well then, I'll talk too

1680
01:24:39,386 --> 01:24:42,386
I like you too, but I can't get enough of it

1681
01:24:42,790 --> 01:24:44,006
This is yummy.

1682
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:45,456
Please eat more

1683
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:48,480
I couldn't help but want to see you, so I came out

1684
01:24:51,489 --> 01:24:53,207
Really?

1685
01:24:54,727 --> 01:24:55,521
 It's true

1686
01:25:02,928 --> 01:25:05,471
like at Marutaka Department Store

1687
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:07,734
It's actually a boring place

1688
01:25:08,207 --> 01:25:11,864
I mean, it's really enviable how they keep saying to increase sales all year round

1689
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,776
Please take a seat

1690
01:25:14,865 --> 01:25:17,813
Sales don't just increase recklessly, you know

1691
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:21,939
I was quite energetic back in my twenties, you see

1692
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:24,376
I keep thinking of various new methods

1693
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,576
I gave a lot of ideas to my boss.

1694
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:28,456
They're really conservative

1695
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,058
everything was Canceled.

1696
01:25:30,890 --> 01:25:33,846
It's so ridiculous that I won't do anything

1697
01:25:33,870 --> 01:25:35,621
That's the safest option

1698
01:25:38,236 --> 01:25:38,963
Shall we leave?

1699
01:25:39,905 --> 01:25:40,678
Check please.

1700
01:25:41,417 --> 01:25:43,077
I'll be in the underground sales area for life

1701
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,209
No, that's not the case

1702
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:48,490
If I had a wife from a president or an executive lineage,

1703
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:50,942
Then surely I could have risen to the top

1704
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:55,875
If I marry someone from the sock department, it will be the end for me, and I will regret it

1705
01:25:56,608 --> 01:25:59,261
just give me some alcohol

1706
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:00,712
Isn't it enough already?

1707
01:26:02,690 --> 01:26:06,808
I'm just waiting to die quietly, whether it's through retirement or my last wishes

1708
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:09,229
I'm only 38, really.

1709
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:17,116
It's a quiet place, isn't it?

1710
01:26:17,140 --> 01:26:19,068
Just a little further after crossing that bridge,

1711
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:22,295
Mr. Nakayama is a pitiful person, isn't he?

1712
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,334
That's true

1713
01:26:23,710 --> 01:26:28,689
The reason he is being mean to us and lashing out is essentially due to his suppressed frustrations.

1714
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:35,126
It's understandable for a salaryman to be weak against the strong, but it's wrong to be strong against the weak

1715
01:26:35,980 --> 01:26:38,507
I believe Mr. Takei will surely become great

1716
01:26:38,969 --> 01:26:42,857
Even after becoming a section chief, you take good care of the people below you

1717
01:26:43,869 --> 01:26:46,959
Since you're a section chief, I'm sure you'll be a very understanding section chief

1718
01:26:48,824 --> 01:26:49,438
Fujita.

1719
01:26:49,927 --> 01:26:53,007
I don't mind if you just call me by my first name.

1720
01:26:55,805 --> 01:26:57,073
then, Setsuko

1721
01:26:58,115 --> 01:27:00,888
I have something to talk about

1722
01:27:01,210 --> 01:27:04,210
Oh, we didn't just talk to each other a moment ago, did we?

1723
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:06,137
There's another story.

1724
01:27:06,540 --> 01:27:09,872
This is exactly what it means to not be able to speak while munching on rice balls

1725
01:27:10,956 --> 01:27:11,669
What?

1726
01:27:13,731 --> 01:27:14,537
Tell me.

1727
01:27:18,302 --> 01:27:19,042
Come on.

1728
01:27:23,332 --> 01:27:24,339
Please marry me

1729
01:27:28,790 --> 01:27:30,459
I haven't even gone to university

1730
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:34,907
my father dies soon so I took care of my younger brother and sister

1731
01:27:35,350 --> 01:27:37,752
As the eldest son, I had to work

1732
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:41,315
Including my salary and everything else,

1733
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:43,360
So far, my savings are about 18,000 yen

1734
01:27:44,470 --> 01:27:47,470
To be honest, my current life is tough

1735
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:52,440
But I really want you to become my wife

1736
01:27:55,682 --> 01:27:56,656
It's too sudden.

1737
01:27:57,815 --> 01:27:59,486
I want to work really hard

1738
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:02,766
When I think of Setsuko-san

1739
01:28:02,790 --> 01:28:03,686
I feel restless

1740
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,010
So I need to stabilize my feelings quickly

1741
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,026
I want to work more and more

1742
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,417
Could you please think about it?

1743
01:28:14,350 --> 01:28:17,350
And please respond as soon as possible

1744
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:22,020
Takei-san, I'm the same. I want to feel calm too

1745
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,566
It's fine if it's just small happiness

1746
01:28:24,590 --> 01:28:26,096
I want to drown in that

1747
01:28:26,860 --> 01:28:29,006
That's quite a quick reply, but...

1748
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:30,879
I accept your propose.

1749
01:28:32,952 --> 01:28:33,712
Setsuko

1750
01:29:04,397 --> 01:29:05,706
Huh? Are they still doing it?

1751
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:10,329
Heh, they're really going crazy

1752
01:29:21,330 --> 01:29:24,330
Well, I've walked the equivalent of 130 yen in a small taxi

1753
01:29:24,550 --> 01:29:25,563
What should we do?

1754
01:29:26,100 --> 01:29:27,722
I still want to walk

1755
01:29:28,242 --> 01:29:29,299
I'm tired

1756
01:29:30,189 --> 01:29:31,536
Well then, let's go

1757
01:29:32,083 --> 01:29:32,689
Where to?

1758
01:29:33,604 --> 01:29:35,311
We can go a place

1759
01:29:35,708 --> 01:29:36,720
Sorry

1760
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,012
I'm going to head home now

1761
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:40,372
My child is almost there, but I'm still a parent, you know

1762
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:41,362
I'm worried

1763
01:29:46,951 --> 01:29:49,525
I'll go home on foot.

1764
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:50,577
Well then,I'll go ahead. See you!

1765
01:30:28,922 --> 01:30:31,135
Matsuno-kun, did you see this month's display?

1766
01:30:31,160 --> 01:30:31,605
No.

1767
01:30:31,746 --> 01:30:32,641
That must be Hata's.

1768
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:37,581
It's bold, innovative, and overwhelming. I think it would be great to incorporate that kind of sensibility into kimonos.

1769
01:30:38,488 --> 01:30:40,410
I feel that kimonos are somewhat different from decorations

1770
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:49,363
There's a longing for the old world behind the desire to wear something as inconvenient and troublesome as traditional Japanese clothing

1771
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,186
As civilization develops,

1772
01:30:51,210 --> 01:30:54,210
Emotions and atmosphere will disappear, won't they?

1773
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:57,396
You know, I've really felt this after reading the current situation

1774
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,276
There are no air conditioning, cars, or jets, nothing at all

1775
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:03,386
Wasn't life more human back in the old days?

1776
01:31:03,996 --> 01:31:06,365
Since I'm a woman, I think classic kimono is better after all

1777
01:31:06,390 --> 01:31:08,116
I can't express it well, but...

1778
01:31:08,140 --> 01:31:09,646
What are you grinning about?

1779
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:11,246
Well, our principles are different, but

1780
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,366
Women who speak their minds clearly are wonderful

1781
01:31:13,390 --> 01:31:15,113
You made me talk.

1782
01:31:16,043 --> 01:31:17,121
Welcome.

1783
01:31:18,988 --> 01:31:20,480
Please show me that outfit

1784
01:31:20,738 --> 01:31:21,434
welcome

1785
01:31:21,680 --> 01:31:24,026
About how many days will it take to finish this cloth?

1786
01:31:24,050 --> 01:31:25,706
It will be completed in 5 days

1787
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:27,456
Really? Then please go ahead

1788
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,378
Thank you very much.

1789
01:31:28,552 --> 01:31:29,428
I will take your measurements

1790
01:31:29,530 --> 01:31:30,261
Please come this way.

1791
01:31:32,176 --> 01:31:33,980
They'll be dating soon.

1792
01:31:34,410 --> 01:31:35,766
What does this mean?

1793
01:31:35,807 --> 01:31:36,785
Well, it's nothing

1794
01:31:38,277 --> 01:31:41,191
lately it's been getting really extravagant, hasn't it?

1795
01:31:41,480 --> 01:31:43,076
Yeah, it's true. We're really in trouble

1796
01:31:43,100 --> 01:31:46,100
That's right, it's really something, isn't it?

1797
01:31:47,210 --> 01:31:48,116
Have you heard that rumor?

1798
01:31:48,140 --> 01:31:49,152
What?

1799
01:31:52,806 --> 01:31:55,552
Is that true? That would be annoying, right?

1800
01:31:55,577 --> 01:31:56,566
Be quiet.

1801
01:31:56,591 --> 01:31:59,591
I don't care if she hears us.

1802
01:32:00,363 --> 01:32:01,434
What?

1803
01:32:02,636 --> 01:32:04,019
Is that a story that concerns me?

1804
01:32:04,605 --> 01:32:06,035
Why don't you just say it clearly If so?

1805
01:32:06,100 --> 01:32:07,520
Don't gossip behind someone's back

1806
01:32:08,793 --> 01:32:11,035
So, let me say it clearly then

1807
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:13,946
When someone like you is in the elevator,

1808
01:32:13,970 --> 01:32:15,364
everyone gets annoyed

1809
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,473
Oh, why?

1810
01:32:17,970 --> 01:32:21,308
With our salary, there's no way we can afford luxurious clothes like yours

1811
01:32:21,360 --> 01:32:22,394
There's no way we can wear that

1812
01:32:22,701 --> 01:32:26,246
I heard there's someone working as a call girl among the elevator attendants

1813
01:32:26,292 --> 01:32:27,355
Don't you know?

1814
01:32:29,830 --> 01:32:31,285
Are you saying that I'm a call girl?

1815
01:32:31,790 --> 01:32:34,246
I can't believe you would do something like that

1816
01:32:34,630 --> 01:32:37,630
But you know, if you wear heavy makeup like that,

1817
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:41,698
It's only natural to be suspected if you get calls from boys for no reason

1818
01:32:41,920 --> 01:32:43,050
That's none of your business

1819
01:32:43,590 --> 01:32:46,590
I'm saying this because the problem is no longer just yours

1820
01:32:50,269 --> 01:32:52,820
Do you all think I'm just a call girl?

1821
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:55,128
Do you think my presence here is a nuisance?

1822
01:32:55,910 --> 01:32:56,839
What do you think?

1823
01:33:01,096 --> 01:33:01,814
What do you think?

1824
01:33:07,094 --> 01:33:07,949
What do you think?

1825
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:12,730
Ryoko, What do you think?

1826
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:19,035
Well, I understand

1827
01:33:21,144 --> 01:33:22,543
but I just wanted to say that

1828
01:33:23,150 --> 01:33:26,076
I'm not a call girl or anything like that

1829
01:33:26,100 --> 01:33:28,676
But you know, whatever I do,
it's my freedom

1830
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,496
I do what I want

1831
01:33:34,348 --> 01:33:35,254
This is the publicity department.

1832
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,910
Is Hata-chan there?

1833
01:33:42,177 --> 01:33:43,871
Hata Hideya?

1834
01:33:45,676 --> 01:33:46,457
Did he quit?

1835
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:48,246
When did he quit?

1836
01:33:57,894 --> 01:33:58,662
Sayuri?

1837
01:33:59,630 --> 01:34:01,436
Oh, are you off today?

1838
01:34:01,460 --> 01:34:02,426
No, I'm going home

1839
01:34:02,450 --> 01:34:03,706
Oh, leaving early?

1840
01:34:03,730 --> 01:34:06,449
No, can Mr. Hata see the store ?

1841
01:34:06,830 --> 01:34:08,667
No, not at all lately

1842
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:09,886
Oh, yeah

1843
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:15,699
I heard that the display he set up here this month has been well-received and that a big PR company has recruited him.

1844
01:34:18,926 --> 01:34:20,542
Oh, you didn't know that?

1845
01:34:24,094 --> 01:34:28,121
Hey, could you please let me work at your shop, Mom?

1846
01:34:29,752 --> 01:34:31,137
Am I quitting here too?

1847
01:34:31,240 --> 01:34:32,300
Because it's boring, you know

1848
01:34:37,831 --> 01:34:40,136
Hello? Is that you, Takei-san?

1849
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,146
I'm Setsuko

1850
01:34:41,170 --> 01:34:42,076
It's tough

1851
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,806
Mr. Nakayama, the supervisor, was hit by a car

1852
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:45,416
I heard he got seriously injured

1853
01:34:45,440 --> 01:34:47,196
Aren't you going to visit tonight?

1854
01:34:47,220 --> 01:34:49,006
I'll buy some flowers

1855
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:51,246
Then let's meet at the usual place at 6:30

1856
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,876
There's no need to go visit someone in the hospital

1857
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,146
He's annyoing.

1858
01:34:54,170 --> 01:34:55,416
Isn't it just pitiful?

1859
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:56,628
I'll take this

1860
01:34:57,887 --> 01:34:58,801
Kimiko

1861
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,796
Why are you making such a strange face?

1862
01:35:04,820 --> 01:35:06,086
Well, it's because Sayuri-chan is wearing a kimono

1863
01:35:06,110 --> 01:35:07,956
Because I saw it for the first time

1864
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:09,656
Surprisingly, it suits you, right?

1865
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,027
I heard you started working at a bar?

1866
01:35:11,152 --> 01:35:11,715
Yes.

1867
01:35:12,436 --> 01:35:13,229
Isn't it interesting?

1868
01:35:13,969 --> 01:35:14,602
Well, yeah

1869
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:18,080
It's definitely more thrilling than working part-time as an elevator girl

1870
01:35:19,010 --> 01:35:20,046
But how should I put it

1871
01:35:20,070 --> 01:35:21,986
It's quite an amazing world, isn't it?

1872
01:35:22,010 --> 01:35:23,336
It must be tough, huh?

1873
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,417
It's not as easy as everyone thinks

1874
01:35:25,980 --> 01:35:28,266
If I want to, I can get money, but...

1875
01:35:28,290 --> 01:35:30,446
It seems like the heart is gradually becoming corrupted

1876
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:32,206
I couldn't manage even a day

1877
01:35:32,230 --> 01:35:34,896
That's right, it's not suitable for a girl like you

1878
01:35:34,927 --> 01:35:38,746
Hehe, but it's a respectable profession for women

1879
01:35:39,280 --> 01:35:40,800
Do it properly, okay?

1880
01:35:41,740 --> 01:35:43,216
However,

1881
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:45,796
What does 'doing it properly' mean in that world?

1882
01:35:45,820 --> 01:35:46,886
I still can't quite grasp it

1883
01:35:48,532 --> 01:35:52,548
But anyway, I'll do it. Show me the kimono for business

1884
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:54,416
I'm already a customer, you know

1885
01:35:54,440 --> 01:35:55,297
Ah, I see.

1886
01:35:55,637 --> 01:35:56,637
Please look around.

1887
01:35:58,099 --> 01:35:59,437
Well, I prefer a white background, though

1888
01:35:59,462 --> 01:36:00,896
Oh dear, it's a bit dirty

1889
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:04,586
It's dim, so it's fine. I like something extravagant and unnecessary for the store.

1890
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,740
What's the budget?

1891
01:36:06,213 --> 01:36:08,206
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

1892
01:36:15,335 --> 01:36:16,115
Sayuri.

1893
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:17,528
Secchan.

1894
01:36:17,553 --> 01:36:18,685
How are you?

1895
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:19,812
Oh yeah.

1896
01:36:19,870 --> 01:36:21,936
I have to thank you, right?

1897
01:36:21,960 --> 01:36:24,586
I decided to marry Takei-san

1898
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:25,326
Just go for it more and more

1899
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:26,706
Sayuri-chan told you, right?

1900
01:36:26,731 --> 01:36:28,720
So it's about one-fifth thanks to you

1901
01:36:28,807 --> 01:36:30,500
I'm glad to hear that.

1902
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,719
It's time to close.

1903
01:36:33,886 --> 01:36:34,999
Be happy.

1904
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:35,705
You too.

1905
01:36:44,922 --> 01:36:46,846
Thank you for visiting us today

1906
01:36:47,343 --> 01:36:49,106
We sincerely appreciate your various purchases

1907
01:36:49,265 --> 01:36:51,425
Thank you very much

1908
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:55,260
It is now 6 o'clock, and it's time to close

1909
01:36:55,849 --> 01:37:00,158
We look forward to your visit again tomorrow

1910
01:37:00,470 --> 01:37:01,775
Thank you very much

1911
01:37:04,679 --> 01:37:10,927
Additionally, the nearby grocery store is open until 6:30 PM, so

1912
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:13,594
please feel free to make use of it

1913
01:37:15,493 --> 01:37:17,050
Thank you very much

1914
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:22,642
Thank you very much

1915
01:37:24,710 --> 01:37:25,530
Thank you

1916
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,126
Thank you for your hard work

1917
01:37:29,150 --> 01:37:31,146
Yes, thank you for your hard work ahead of me

1918
01:37:31,170 --> 01:37:32,996
Yes, thank you for your efforts

1919
01:37:33,894 --> 01:37:35,806
Thank you for your hard work

1920
01:37:35,830 --> 01:37:37,933
I have a request, Manager

1921
01:37:38,598 --> 01:37:39,262
Tell me.

1922
01:37:40,222 --> 01:37:42,996
I would like you to officiate the marriage between Matsuno-kun and me

1923
01:37:45,726 --> 01:37:50,683
 Ubukata-san, aren't you forgetting something important?

1924
01:37:50,860 --> 01:37:51,699
What do you mean?

1925
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:55,186
You haven't proposed to me even once yet

1926
01:37:55,211 --> 01:37:56,722
Ah, I see.

1927
01:37:57,324 --> 01:37:59,910
Then would you marry me?

1928
01:38:04,543 --> 01:38:05,894
It's fine, it's fine

1929
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:07,871
Please don't provoke the elderly

1930
01:38:08,780 --> 01:38:11,780
Well, I was prepared for it to come around this time

1931
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,046
How did you know?

1932
01:38:14,070 --> 01:38:15,191
No, it's just a intuition.

1933
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:17,167
After many years of intuition

1934
01:38:19,566 --> 01:38:21,824
 we don't have high hopes for you as a couple

1935
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:25,300
I believe that a new couple in a new era will surely emerge

1936
01:38:25,795 --> 01:38:26,863
Anyway, congratulations

1937
01:38:27,066 --> 01:38:28,035
thank you!

1938
01:38:28,144 --> 01:38:28,965
Good luck.

1939
01:38:32,647 --> 01:38:34,496
Let's create a new couple.

1940
01:38:34,723 --> 01:38:37,559
Yes, I absolutely won't lose to you.

1941
01:38:37,926 --> 01:38:39,426
I'll continue working even after we get married

1942
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:42,800
The department store, the library, and you all help with housework

1943
01:38:43,030 --> 01:38:44,486
I don't want you to be jealous

1944
01:38:44,510 --> 01:38:46,026
Please respect my opinion as well

1945
01:38:46,050 --> 01:38:46,826
Everything is equal

1946
01:38:46,850 --> 01:38:48,216
Everything is a collaboration, okay?

1947
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:48,578
Got it?

1948
01:38:48,602 --> 01:38:50,433
I got it, I got it, I got it, I understand

1949
01:38:50,983 --> 01:38:52,779
At least let me have the engagement kiss

1950
01:38:53,210 --> 01:38:56,210
Well, here? How unsanitary.

1951
01:38:56,235 --> 01:38:56,949
How unsanitary?

1952
01:38:57,469 --> 01:38:59,984
What’s unsanitary about it?
That kind of thinking is outdated.

1953
01:39:00,897 --> 01:39:01,590
That's right?

1954
01:39:03,074 --> 01:39:03,990
Is anyone here?

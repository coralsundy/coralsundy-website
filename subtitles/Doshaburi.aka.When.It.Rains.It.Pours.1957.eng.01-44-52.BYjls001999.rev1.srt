Doshaburi / When It Rains, It Pours (1957)

3
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,380
Thank you very much.

4
00:02:17,785 --> 00:02:19,045
Hurry up, or you'll be late.

5
00:02:21,892 --> 00:02:24,506
Mother.
Present for you.

6
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:26,919
I got a little raise this month.

7
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,637
That's great.

8
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:30,334
What's this?

9
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:36,296
This is so great.

10
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:38,930
I can still use my current purse.

11
00:02:39,266 --> 00:02:40,783
Old wallets are bad luck.

12
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:41,510
Why?

13
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:43,597
All the money goes out.

14
00:02:44,121 --> 00:02:46,107
You know, that's funny.

15
00:02:50,456 --> 00:02:52,136
Wake up!
or you'll be late.

16
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,123
Bros!

17
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,063
It's too early.

18
00:02:57,045 --> 00:02:59,565
Wake up!

19
00:03:00,152 --> 00:03:01,538
Damn it!

20
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:07,803
What are you doing?

21
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,916
My hair's a mess.

22
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:11,649
Let's go!

23
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:12,716
You are stupid.

24
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,319
I'm going.

25
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,732
Can you get home early?

26
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:25,699
It could be.

27
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,669
Your father's on his way back from Hokkaido.

28
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,158
I'll be home soon.

29
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:31,158
I'm off too.

30
00:03:31,431 --> 00:03:32,664
Take care.

31
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,786
Please serve fish.

32
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:52,469
Damn it!

33
00:04:21,337 --> 00:04:22,757
Thank you very much.

34
00:04:49,086 --> 00:04:52,393
(I'll wait for you at that restaurant)

35
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:12,350
There's something I wanted to talk to you guys about today.

36
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:15,138
I asked Sudo-kun to join us.

37
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:17,911
Have a seat.

38
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:21,335
Be relax.

39
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:29,903
Actually... it's about you two.
No, it's not a bad thing.

40
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:31,115
Right,Sudo?

41
00:05:34,196 --> 00:05:38,383
He's very concerned about us, and he's aware of our relationship.

42
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,957
There's a rumor going around the company about you guys.

43
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:48,178
How about a workplace marriage?

44
00:05:50,147 --> 00:05:51,454
Let me think about it.

45
00:05:52,381 --> 00:05:55,494
I've known him since he was a little boy.

46
00:05:56,042 --> 00:05:59,789
He was crying boy.

47
00:06:00,617 --> 00:06:02,843
Don't talk about that.

48
00:06:03,507 --> 00:06:07,013
And, you know, his mom asked me if I could help him find someone.

49
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:11,306
You sure you don't want me to handle this?

50
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:16,132
I'll leave it to you, sir.

51
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:17,558
Ok.

52
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,623
I'm sorry to worry you.

53
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,115
It's nice to see young people being so active.

54
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:24,253
I envy you guys.

55
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:33,145
Your place is an inn?

56
00:06:33,197 --> 00:06:38,504
It's a small place, but we've always had a lot of regular customers.

57
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:43,349
I think its good business practice.

58
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:44,909
There are a lot of strange guests these days.

59
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,176
How's your parents?

60
00:06:49,766 --> 00:06:54,006
My father died when I was a kid.

61
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,227
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:55,805 --> 00:06:56,705
By Cerebral anemia.

63
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:58,951
I'm sorry.

64
00:07:00,148 --> 00:07:02,815
You were raised by your mother, weren't you?

65
00:07:03,028 --> 00:07:03,362
Yes.

66
00:07:08,378 --> 00:07:09,618
Hey, three mugs.

67
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:12,152
I can't drink anymore.

68
00:07:12,195 --> 00:07:14,935
Just one more for us.

69
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:16,543
Thanks.

70
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,147
She can drink.

71
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:21,286
How much can you drink?

72
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:25,707
She can drink 5 mugs.

73
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:26,865
5 mugs?

74
00:07:32,172 --> 00:07:37,205
Let's toast for your work place marriage.

75
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,634
I can't drink 5 mugs.

76
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:51,108
He was surprised.

77
00:07:51,689 --> 00:07:54,963
Exemplary workplace marriage.

78
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,303
I worry..

79
00:07:59,296 --> 00:07:59,870
For what?

80
00:08:01,244 --> 00:08:04,858
You're so happy, it's kind of scary.

81
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:08,212
You worry too much.

82
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:11,365
I got drunk.

83
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:13,236
Are you alright?

84
00:08:15,249 --> 00:08:16,063
Let's get some rest.

85
00:08:25,607 --> 00:08:32,867
I want to be a good wife.
I want two strong boys and a beautiful girl.

86
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:40,030
Let's go see your mother now.

87
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,487
We'll surprise her by telling her about today.

88
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,322
We can't.

89
00:08:44,801 --> 00:08:45,294
Why?

90
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,774
I've never been to your house.

91
00:08:48,242 --> 00:08:51,655
Not tonight.
I'll tell her all about it.

92
00:08:53,094 --> 00:08:55,401
I'll call you one of these days.

93
00:08:56,607 --> 00:08:57,714
Wait till then.

94
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:09,697
Good evening.

95
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:12,764
Welcome.

96
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:15,723
Do you have a room where I usually stay?

97
00:09:16,136 --> 00:09:16,696
Please come in.

98
00:09:18,128 --> 00:09:20,148
Come in, boy.

99
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:27,872
Take them to Kiri room.

100
00:09:29,372 --> 00:09:30,312
Please come in.

101
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,670
It seems your business is busy.

102
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:42,531
Thank you very much.

103
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:44,184
This is a souvenir from Hakodate.

104
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,984
This is awesome.

105
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:47,626
You like it.

106
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,246
Thank you very much.

107
00:09:49,414 --> 00:09:50,940
I'll serve you a sake.

108
00:09:53,607 --> 00:09:54,440
Have a seat.

109
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,086
I'm so tired.

110
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,915
Can you rub my shoulders for a minute?

111
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,234
Can you rub my shoulders for a minute?

112
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,977
Thank you.

113
00:10:14,577 --> 00:10:16,037
The bath is ready.

114
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:16,943
Thank you.

115
00:10:17,418 --> 00:10:19,618
What do you want?

116
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,165
I'm starving.

117
00:10:21,512 --> 00:10:23,625
Let's get something to eat first.

118
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:29,200
He's so selfish, isn't he?

119
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,490
Thank you.

120
00:10:36,649 --> 00:10:38,242
She took different boy.

121
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:39,628
Who's she?

122
00:10:39,908 --> 00:10:41,035
A madam?

123
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:42,495
I have no idea.

124
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:47,274
I'm home.

125
00:10:47,754 --> 00:10:49,827
I've brought these today.

126
00:10:52,424 --> 00:10:54,370
Oh dad is here?

127
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:55,268
He's just come.

128
00:10:55,472 --> 00:10:57,025
I can drink again.

129
00:10:58,003 --> 00:10:59,116
Serve him.

130
00:11:02,538 --> 00:11:03,518
Welcome home.

131
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:05,898
Where have you been?

132
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:07,984
Pachinko.

133
00:11:08,312 --> 00:11:10,552
I walked there.

134
00:11:11,421 --> 00:11:12,928
I got this for 30yen.

135
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,368
How about eating this.

136
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:29,530
Have a drink?

137
00:11:29,943 --> 00:11:31,490
Thank you very much.

138
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,650
Where's Matsuko?

139
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,887
She said she was going home early today.

140
00:11:38,035 --> 00:11:39,288
What's the hell?

141
00:11:40,363 --> 00:11:41,676
It's spring.

142
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,834
A customer ordered tamagoyaki (fried egg) and unadon (bowl of rice topped with eel)

143
00:11:49,402 --> 00:11:51,542
The woman is strange.

144
00:11:51,862 --> 00:11:53,495
You have a bad idea.

145
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,820
She sleeps with a guy every night.

146
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:01,214
Hello?
This is Kotobuki.

147
00:12:01,993 --> 00:12:06,187
Our customer ordered tamagoyaki (fried egg) and unadon (bowl of rice topped with eel)

148
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:11,262
I had a dream about my father.

149
00:12:11,336 --> 00:12:12,242
What dream?

150
00:12:12,411 --> 00:12:15,744
You were dancing with the Ainu.

151
00:12:16,508 --> 00:12:17,588
That's a weird dream.

152
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:20,192
But your business is romantic, too.

153
00:12:20,822 --> 00:12:25,069
You roam Hokkaido, buying bear pelts.

154
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,993
Wait Yamada.

155
00:12:33,168 --> 00:12:34,742
I was kidding.

156
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:36,270
Stop doing it.

157
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:37,510
Get your hands off of me!

158
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:40,962
Wait Yamada.

159
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:46,056
I leave the fee.

160
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,806
It's not very educational.

161
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:56,714
I think you're right that buying this house and letting your mother run the business was a great idea.

162
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,265
Sarcasm?

163
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,412
I'm just being honest.
I'm grateful.

164
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:06,318
This business is the only reason we are able to eat without any inconvenience, apparently.

165
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:10,932
But sometimes I wonder if I'm doing the right thing.

166
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:19,533
Seeing so many strange customers drives me crazy.

167
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:23,634
You don't have to talk about it now.
Your father comes by once in a while.

168
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:26,582
He might be right.

169
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,538
But that doesn't mean there's nothing we can do about it.

170
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,182
Let's keep the world interesting.

171
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,088
It's time to go.

172
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:52,266
It's time he leaves.

173
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:03,570
Why don't you stay over?

174
00:14:04,221 --> 00:14:05,821
Just tonight.

175
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,436
Don't make him confuse.

176
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:10,957
See you.

177
00:14:20,371 --> 00:14:23,838
I wanted to see Matsuko.
Say hello to her.

178
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,335
I'll come next week.

179
00:14:26,054 --> 00:14:27,278
Take care.

180
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,133
See you.

181
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:45,421
Oh Matsuko?

182
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,009
Oh dad.

183
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:49,876
I've been waiting for you.

184
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,606
Sorry I'm late.

185
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:53,793
Did you go to movie or somewhere?

186
00:14:54,843 --> 00:15:00,710
No.
I'm so happy about something that happened today.

187
00:15:00,868 --> 00:15:01,674
What's that?

188
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:04,814
I'll tell you about it.

189
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,414
I'd like to hear.

190
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,199
Let's walk to the park.

191
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,836
That's good.

192
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:22,998
I'm just glad you guys are happy.

193
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:28,617
I made a lie.

194
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:29,785
What?

195
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,145
I told him you died.

196
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,392
I told him that.

197
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,719
Oh I see.

198
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:45,464
I told him you died of cerebral anemia.

199
00:15:45,588 --> 00:15:50,043
What?
I would have preferred another disease.

200
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,548
Sorry.

201
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:54,548
It can't be helped.

202
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,977
It's hard to tell my mother about this.

203
00:16:00,135 --> 00:16:02,232
I'll tell her later.

204
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:07,198
Dad.

205
00:16:08,113 --> 00:16:10,638
I don't know if it's gonna be okay.

206
00:16:12,522 --> 00:16:13,473
It's going to be fine.

207
00:16:14,563 --> 00:16:16,332
If you really love each other.

208
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,058
I wish you the best.

209
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:22,402
Thank you. Good night.

210
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:25,414
Good night.

211
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:49,599
Excuse me.

212
00:16:52,294 --> 00:16:55,397
Do you have a neighbor named Abe?

213
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,848
Abe?

214
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:58,611
Tame Abe.

215
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:00,674
Oh Otame.

216
00:17:01,592 --> 00:17:03,840
She run inn.

217
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:08,337
It's a inn but just small.

218
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,311
It's over there.

219
00:17:13,856 --> 00:17:15,517
They are busy.

220
00:17:16,334 --> 00:17:18,843
When I look at it this way, I see all kinds of people coming in.

221
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:22,597
People like street girl, gang,Madam etc.

222
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:25,698
They look so nonchalant, like they're walking into a buckwheat noodle shop.

223
00:17:26,594 --> 00:17:30,388
You'd be surprised, wouldn't you?

224
00:17:32,236 --> 00:17:35,048
I want you to be more flexible.

225
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:36,957
Just 3.

226
00:17:37,884 --> 00:17:38,642
Thank you very much.

227
00:17:39,862 --> 00:17:45,632
Kameyama is crazy about this.

228
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:47,768
I'm mad at him.

229
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,785
I'm in trouble.

230
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,373
Get along well with your suppliers.

231
00:17:53,984 --> 00:17:59,572
Unlike your business, it's hard to make a day's wage.

232
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,732
We have a hard time too.

233
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:07,211
You can keep this as collateral.

234
00:18:07,581 --> 00:18:09,993
You don't have to do that.

235
00:18:10,939 --> 00:18:12,854
You look happy.

236
00:18:13,309 --> 00:18:17,158
Your husband buy this house for you.
Your kids are nice.

237
00:18:25,281 --> 00:18:26,093
Excuse me.

238
00:18:28,532 --> 00:18:30,083
Welcome.

239
00:18:33,787 --> 00:18:36,290
There's a room available.
Please come in.

240
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,308
You have a guest even in the noon.

241
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,993
Don't look at her.

242
00:18:49,903 --> 00:18:51,836
What kind of person is she?

243
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:55,929
It's a strange world.

244
00:18:58,989 --> 00:18:59,553
Come in.

245
00:19:02,537 --> 00:19:04,573
It's nice weather.

246
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:10,063
Are you alone?

247
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,475
Someone will come later?

248
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,584
I'll serve you a tea.

249
00:19:33,355 --> 00:19:35,955
Let's have a nap before sex.

250
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:37,258
I don't have sex with you.

251
00:19:37,341 --> 00:19:39,147
Hey, you dance at bar.

252
00:19:39,238 --> 00:19:40,432
You damn it.

253
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:44,841
She's kind of weird.

254
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:48,069
I see.
I'll serve her.

255
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:52,847
Excuse me.

256
00:20:10,734 --> 00:20:11,443
I'm home.

257
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:21,621
Welcome home.

258
00:20:22,609 --> 00:20:24,767
I'm starving.

259
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:25,985
I need to talk to you.

260
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:28,294
What?

261
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:30,492
Let's talk in front of your father.

262
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:44,379
When your father died, he made a will that you be raised to be a man of honor.

263
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:46,415
I know.

264
00:20:47,306 --> 00:20:51,288
I'm relying on you alone.

265
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,421
I know.

266
00:20:53,563 --> 00:20:59,612
Okay, then.
I firmly declined the Chief's offer on the phone earlier.

267
00:21:01,684 --> 00:21:03,084
I absolutely disapprove.

268
00:21:03,874 --> 00:21:06,050
You didn't even ask me for a word of advice.

269
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,896
I don't need to talk to you.

270
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,743
You lied to me.

271
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:11,901
What?

272
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:16,083
Her house run Love hotel.

273
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:19,669
Her mother is kind of mistress.

274
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,579
I can't believe it.

275
00:21:26,565 --> 00:21:28,759
She told me they run old inn.

276
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,450
There must be some kind of mistake.

277
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:34,416
I've seen it with my own eyes.

278
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,485
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.

279
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,585
She didn't have to tell a lie.

280
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:43,227
You are ignorance.

281
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:47,353
You don't know what is the world nowadays.

282
00:21:48,343 --> 00:21:50,495
I'm mad at your chief too.

283
00:21:51,445 --> 00:21:53,517
He is making a fool of me.

284
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,447
That's enough.

285
00:22:32,997 --> 00:22:34,706
Sorry I'm late.

286
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,046
Did you wait?

287
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,323
40min.

288
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:37,939
Sorry.

289
00:22:38,454 --> 00:22:40,036
Give us 2 mugs.

290
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:44,369
What do you want to talk?

291
00:22:46,598 --> 00:22:49,174
You seem annoyed to see me these days, don't you?

292
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:50,529
What are you talking about?

293
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:55,427
Your Chief told me today.

294
00:23:00,473 --> 00:23:03,109
He said you're in a relationship with someone else.

295
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:09,126
I heard she's the daughter of an executive from a very nice family.

296
00:23:10,713 --> 00:23:15,356
She's younger than me.
Why didn't you tell me?

297
00:23:15,816 --> 00:23:16,919
Here it is.

298
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:25,421
Never mind.

299
00:23:26,664 --> 00:23:27,651
I'm bad.

300
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,207
Why you lied to me?

301
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:35,735
About your house.

302
00:23:38,293 --> 00:23:40,639
You should have told me earlier.

303
00:23:42,403 --> 00:23:45,469
I was going to tell you.

304
00:23:46,397 --> 00:23:47,797
I just couldn't say it.

305
00:23:54,037 --> 00:23:55,849
Why don't we talk about it over dinner?

306
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:02,510
I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

307
00:24:28,022 --> 00:24:32,391
It's none of her business.
It's up to you.

308
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:40,150
That woman or me?
That's what I'm asking you.

309
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,995
You need to clarify.

310
00:25:44,089 --> 00:25:45,422
It's too late.

311
00:25:46,667 --> 00:25:47,988
It's ok if you go home first.

312
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:52,160
I'll send you off.

313
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:54,970
So come to my home.

314
00:25:56,548 --> 00:25:57,651
Meet my mom.

315
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,644
Onsen Mark
You don't know that.

316
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:07,929
We get all kinds of visitors.
Come on, I'll show you.

317
00:26:22,429 --> 00:26:28,108
Well, I guess we can't get married... time to say goodbye.
Let's say goodbye.

318
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:51,451
Oh my god.

319
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:56,428
Welcome back.

320
00:26:56,701 --> 00:26:57,631
You're late as usual.

321
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:00,943
Hey, Dad bring something nice for you.

322
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,704
She's a funny girl.

323
00:27:35,894 --> 00:27:37,433
Are you upset today?

324
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:40,808
I'll give you this.

325
00:27:43,285 --> 00:27:44,262
Try this on.

326
00:27:52,077 --> 00:27:52,788
Good.

327
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:57,382
This ring is a gift for you.

328
00:27:59,452 --> 00:28:04,273
I was waiting for you to come home so I could tell your mom about the other day.

329
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,295
Forget about that.

330
00:28:11,287 --> 00:28:11,959
Why?

331
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:14,482
I'll talk to my mom.

332
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,131
I'll talk to her.

333
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:23,084
All I have is my mom.

334
00:28:25,826 --> 00:28:27,826
Oh yeah.

335
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,756
I'm supposed to be dead.

336
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,209
Anyway let's have a drink.

337
00:28:40,943 --> 00:28:44,232
Where takenosuke's been?

338
00:29:00,706 --> 00:29:03,331
We have to go home.

339
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,393
It's better late.

340
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,846
Our dad is at home today.

341
00:29:08,964 --> 00:29:10,776
Oh yeah.

342
00:29:14,581 --> 00:29:17,464
Kids are so difficult when they grow up.

343
00:29:17,768 --> 00:29:19,026
How's their kids?

344
00:29:19,354 --> 00:29:21,620
I'm always at Nihonbash home.

345
00:29:22,792 --> 00:29:25,057
Over here it's their dad once a week.

346
00:29:26,026 --> 00:29:28,026
I feel sorry for them.

347
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:35,385
I'd like to be their sounding board.
but Something's just not right.

348
00:29:36,175 --> 00:29:37,737
Probably because I feel guilty.

349
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:41,378
But the kids are very dependent on their father.

350
00:29:42,339 --> 00:29:45,190
When they get older, a female parent isn't good enough.

351
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,714
I'm an unreliable dad.

352
00:29:54,204 --> 00:29:55,486
What's wrong with Matsuko..

353
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:01,931
What's wrong?

354
00:30:03,251 --> 00:30:04,595
She's 24?

355
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:05,564
25.

356
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,626
Oh right.

357
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,345
Matsuko was already born when you were 25 years old.

358
00:30:14,806 --> 00:30:17,228
Takenosuke was in your stomach.

359
00:30:17,931 --> 00:30:19,064
Time goes fast.

360
00:30:23,165 --> 00:30:24,556
25 years.

361
00:30:27,009 --> 00:30:28,384
Time goes fast.

362
00:30:30,267 --> 00:30:31,720
I've put you through a lot.

363
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,579
Let's go have a drink.

364
00:31:14,545 --> 00:31:15,873
I wanna drink too.

365
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:20,029
Can you drink lately?

366
00:31:20,248 --> 00:31:22,014
Yes kind of.

367
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:31,474
I wanna drink more.

368
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,660
Don't push yourself too hard.

369
00:31:42,465 --> 00:31:45,285
Dad, you have no right to say anything.

370
00:31:48,621 --> 00:31:49,238
OK.

371
00:31:51,074 --> 00:31:58,605
Well, if that's what you want, I won't say anything.
I'm just trying to get to know you guys as best I can.

372
00:32:01,074 --> 00:32:04,425
You're all grown up now, and you're gonna run into things.

373
00:32:04,886 --> 00:32:06,808
I'm just trying to be a sounding board.

374
00:32:07,089 --> 00:32:08,480
I know exactly what you mean.

375
00:32:09,816 --> 00:32:11,863
Well, then you're gonna have to tell me everything.

376
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:17,660
In your long life, you will encounter many problems that you can't handle on your own.

377
00:32:17,941 --> 00:32:20,768
I will handle it myself.
I don't need anyone else to take care of it.

378
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:23,449
Watch your mouth.

379
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,042
She's in bad mood.

380
00:32:33,144 --> 00:32:34,456
Let's talk about it later.

381
00:32:41,343 --> 00:32:43,132
I'll see him off.

382
00:32:43,718 --> 00:32:46,335
It's your job.

383
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,241
You take a bath.

384
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:51,312
I don't take a bath at home.

385
00:32:58,124 --> 00:32:59,460
You're going out.

386
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:02,421
You take a bath.

387
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:08,515
Take care.

388
00:33:10,241 --> 00:33:11,491
I'm going.

389
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:19,601
I'll take a bath.

390
00:33:28,989 --> 00:33:29,887
Good evening.

391
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:33,239
Is there room available.

392
00:33:35,637 --> 00:33:36,700
Hey.

393
00:33:38,364 --> 00:33:39,262
Is there room available.

394
00:33:41,762 --> 00:33:42,996
I know you are there.

395
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:45,512
Hey.

396
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:26,789
Sis

397
00:34:53,708 --> 00:35:03,060
(It's some kind of spell)

398
00:35:16,123 --> 00:35:22,232
God told me that he ran toward Tatsumi, but he'll be back shortly

399
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,428
Tatsumi?

400
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:27,107
North or south.

401
00:35:27,654 --> 00:35:32,045
Either way, he's going home soon. You shouldn't worry too much.

402
00:35:36,981 --> 00:35:38,567
Busy, busy.

403
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,394
Welcome home.
How'd it go?

404
00:35:40,419 --> 00:35:44,309
the police are really unreliable.

405
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:46,364
Welcome home.

406
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:56,473
I've been looking all over the place, but I can't find her at all.

407
00:35:56,498 --> 00:35:57,559
Sorry.

408
00:35:57,934 --> 00:35:59,489
Don't get me wrong.

409
00:36:00,293 --> 00:36:04,231
Is there anything else that comes to mind with Matsuko?

410
00:36:06,153 --> 00:36:09,700
For example, did Matsuko's behavior seem strange or something?

411
00:36:11,418 --> 00:36:15,957
Come to think of it, she ran away from home, got strangely frustrated, got into a fight with her dad.

412
00:36:18,137 --> 00:36:20,200
she has a relationship with a man.

413
00:36:21,075 --> 00:36:23,762
It must be so.

414
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:25,872
they might have eloped.

415
00:36:26,325 --> 00:36:27,575
They are together.

416
00:36:27,684 --> 00:36:30,176
Shut up.

417
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:34,489
Do you know any other guys who dated Matsuko?

418
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,113
I don't know anything about that.

419
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,770
Even if that were the case, I don't think she would elope.

420
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,574
I don't think she would do something like that because she is very serious.

421
00:36:52,829 --> 00:36:57,415
She's not like us.

422
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:02,087
We eloped before, didn't we?

423
00:37:02,112 --> 00:37:03,024
Shut up.

424
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:04,712
You talk too much.

425
00:37:05,759 --> 00:37:07,415
I wonder where she went.

426
00:37:58,082 --> 00:37:59,332
You have a guest.

427
00:38:23,955 --> 00:38:24,970
It's been a while.

428
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:26,642
How did you know here?

429
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,783
Ueno-san told us about your location.

430
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:36,134
Oh Ueno.
I told him not to say anything.

431
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:38,970
Wanna drink?

432
00:38:44,994 --> 00:38:46,259
You've changed.

433
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:51,447
I've been living like this for two years.
I'm not supposed to change.

434
00:38:55,048 --> 00:38:56,126
I've missed you.

435
00:38:57,665 --> 00:39:01,361
What's the hell?
Let's dance.

436
00:39:08,392 --> 00:39:09,298
What's the matter?

437
00:39:11,962 --> 00:39:13,033
I don't want to dance.

438
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:17,681
You're a funny guy.
Business trip?

439
00:39:20,179 --> 00:39:21,015
Kind of.

440
00:39:23,421 --> 00:39:27,499
You keep staring at my face.

441
00:39:30,913 --> 00:39:33,632
I need to talk to you.

442
00:39:33,936 --> 00:39:36,819
I don't wanna talk.

443
00:39:38,061 --> 00:39:39,819
Have a drink.

444
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:50,771
Here.

445
00:39:51,458 --> 00:39:52,396
Thanks.

446
00:39:52,857 --> 00:39:53,685
Thanks.

447
00:40:05,117 --> 00:40:08,187
I can't help it... you're drunk as a skunk.

448
00:40:16,857 --> 00:40:18,528
You changed yourself too.

449
00:40:22,122 --> 00:40:27,427
I'm leaving.
I'll see you some other time if we have a chance.

450
00:40:28,185 --> 00:40:29,794
See you.

451
00:40:34,397 --> 00:40:35,592
Don't make fun of me!

452
00:40:48,574 --> 00:40:49,230
I'm leaving.

453
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:53,254
What are you going to do with me?

454
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:29,354
I could still see it from my window.

455
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:31,995
You know?

456
00:41:34,028 --> 00:41:39,153
That symbol is still a dark memory in my mind.

457
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,332
I know that now.

458
00:41:43,059 --> 00:41:45,637
How you hid your business.

459
00:41:45,887 --> 00:41:47,832
It's too late for that.

460
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:54,215
You have a wife.
You're going to have kids.

461
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:15,764
But ever since I was found by the authorities in that cabaret.
I knew you'd come for me one day, and I knew this would happen.

462
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:22,601
I can't go back to Tokyo anymore.

463
00:42:23,413 --> 00:42:23,999
Why?

464
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:26,077
I need you to hide me for a while.

465
00:42:27,062 --> 00:42:28,437
Someone chase me.

466
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:30,194
What's wrong?

467
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,069
Did you do something wrong?

468
00:42:47,445 --> 00:42:50,093
Did you have something to do with this?

469
00:42:52,867 --> 00:42:55,273
Only lower-ranking employees like me are arrested.

470
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:05,134
I wanted to see you one more time before I got caught.

471
00:43:38,643 --> 00:43:39,775
What are you thinking?

472
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,518
About your wife?

473
00:43:43,205 --> 00:43:44,486
or baby?

474
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,588
Don't say bullshit.

475
00:43:46,924 --> 00:43:50,291
You still think of them when you're away like this, don't you?

476
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,229
I know what's in your heart.

477
00:43:57,924 --> 00:43:59,439
You want to go back to Tokyo?

478
00:44:04,502 --> 00:44:07,338
You want to go home.
It's written all over your face.

479
00:44:09,439 --> 00:44:10,322
I want to go home.

480
00:44:12,877 --> 00:44:17,861
I don't want to spend every day in this cramped place.

481
00:44:18,807 --> 00:44:20,760
The police will arrest you as soon as you leave.

482
00:44:24,088 --> 00:44:30,338
I won't return you alone again.
I won't let you go this time, no matter what happens.

483
00:44:52,545 --> 00:44:53,607
What's wrong?

484
00:44:57,568 --> 00:44:58,303
Nothing.

485
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,107
I'm going to work.

486
00:45:02,568 --> 00:45:03,959
You don't have a cigarette, do you?

487
00:45:09,404 --> 00:45:13,115
I'll be back as soon as I can.
There's a ham in the cupboard.

488
00:45:41,799 --> 00:45:43,791
What's wrong?

489
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:47,197
The police are just investigating the family register.

490
00:45:52,429 --> 00:45:54,937
You really don't know this Sudo guy?

491
00:45:55,265 --> 00:45:55,999
No.

492
00:45:58,085 --> 00:46:01,491
And my daughter is with the Sudo?

493
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:03,827
She's just hiding him.

494
00:46:04,601 --> 00:46:06,749
The man is still at large on bribery charges.

495
00:46:07,374 --> 00:46:09,788
I think he's going back to Tokyo anyway.

496
00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:15,265
If he stops by your place, or if you know where he is, please give us a call.

497
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:20,499
I heard he was hiding out with your daughter in Kobe for quite a while.

498
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:24,046
He flew to Kyoto, apparently, when he was spotted.

499
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:26,937
Are you sure he hasn't come to your house?

500
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:28,288
No.

501
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,991
Thank you very much.

502
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:09,873
She fell for the wrong guy.

503
00:47:10,389 --> 00:47:13,404
After two years, we finally find out where she is, and now this.

504
00:47:14,295 --> 00:47:16,303
Well, it's a good thing she's okay.

505
00:47:16,951 --> 00:47:19,365
The guy is called Sudo?

506
00:47:20,428 --> 00:47:23,139
The man has a wife and a newborn baby.

507
00:47:23,592 --> 00:47:27,373
I think she has a very deep relationship with him.

508
00:47:29,178 --> 00:47:31,357
Don't worry too much.

509
00:47:31,678 --> 00:47:36,498
I'm going to Kyoto at the end of this month.
I'll see what I can find out.

510
00:47:36,764 --> 00:47:37,842
Thanks.

511
00:47:42,455 --> 00:47:46,377
Cheer up.

512
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:49,533
I'll ask God.

513
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,158
Oh again.

514
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:55,861
Stop doing it.

515
00:47:56,408 --> 00:47:58,791
That god is of no use.

516
00:47:59,166 --> 00:48:00,681
Don't ask the god.

517
00:48:01,291 --> 00:48:03,486
Look at that.

518
00:48:03,924 --> 00:48:11,783
As God told us, we purchased a lot of that product.

519
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,955
But they doesn't sell out.

520
00:48:15,221 --> 00:48:17,869
Because you bought a bad product.

521
00:48:18,213 --> 00:48:20,650
You have an old way of thinking.

522
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,213
Don't blame others.

523
00:48:23,431 --> 00:48:26,041
Please eat.

524
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,002
Don't worry too much.

525
00:48:30,205 --> 00:48:31,830
Cheer up.

526
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:38,845
I know Matsuko would have had a hard time with that.
A woman's failure with a man is a life experience.

527
00:48:39,275 --> 00:48:45,142
I've been having a hard time since I married him.

528
00:48:45,392 --> 00:48:47,330
Don't say that.

529
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:49,588
Have a drink.

530
00:48:59,068 --> 00:49:01,318
She likes Sushi.

531
00:49:02,592 --> 00:49:07,271
She likes Wasabi too.

532
00:49:10,899 --> 00:49:13,290
She's really good girl..

533
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:39,352
Give me a beer.

534
00:49:39,672 --> 00:49:41,532
I don't drink coffee.

535
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:44,633
you haven't paid your accounts receivable yet.

536
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:48,274
What are you doing?

537
00:49:49,102 --> 00:49:50,462
Come here.

538
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:55,149
We don't go to school because the weather is nice.

539
00:49:56,376 --> 00:50:00,813
I'll play you some good music.

540
00:50:05,792 --> 00:50:07,605
Can you hear?

541
00:50:13,097 --> 00:50:14,745
It's noisy.

542
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,172
Oh.

543
00:50:22,766 --> 00:50:23,446
Is this fine?

544
00:50:23,711 --> 00:50:24,204
What?

545
00:50:24,415 --> 00:50:25,141
You said it was noisy.

546
00:50:25,586 --> 00:50:28,204
I mean this article.

547
00:50:28,305 --> 00:50:29,610
What?

548
00:50:29,915 --> 00:50:31,563
Why don't you at least read the paper once in a while?

549
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,930
Our tax dollars are being spent by government officials.

550
00:50:36,118 --> 00:50:37,602
You pay tax?

551
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:40,118
Taxes on cigarettes and beer are rising rapidly.

552
00:50:40,149 --> 00:50:41,594
So don't have a beer.

553
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:43,251
Shut up!

554
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:52,716
The love hotel business is becoming more difficult.

555
00:50:53,075 --> 00:50:54,497
Will taxes go up?

556
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:59,505
It seems that the operation of love hotels near schools will be prohibited.

557
00:50:59,530 --> 00:51:01,552
Do you also manage a love hotel?

558
00:51:01,708 --> 00:51:04,794
If you come, I will give you a 200 yen discount.

559
00:51:05,122 --> 00:51:06,950
You're dirty.

560
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:15,615
This.

561
00:51:17,036 --> 00:51:17,880
Shall we go eat this ramen?

562
00:51:18,185 --> 00:51:19,044
Treat me.

563
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:24,028
Let's go to cinema after we eat ramen.

564
00:51:24,053 --> 00:51:26,341
Will you also pay for the movie?

565
00:51:26,529 --> 00:51:27,505
You have money, don't you?

566
00:51:27,747 --> 00:51:29,544
You're so smart.

567
00:51:29,732 --> 00:51:31,615
Let's go home then.

568
00:51:31,747 --> 00:51:32,575
I'll pay.

569
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:33,380
I see.

570
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:36,029
You'll pay for me later.

571
00:51:37,247 --> 00:51:39,568
You're so smart too.

572
00:51:39,841 --> 00:51:40,904
Let's go.

573
00:51:44,448 --> 00:51:48,643
His wife cries every day
And she has a child.

574
00:51:49,089 --> 00:51:51,901
I really don't know what to do.

575
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:53,846
I’m sorry.

576
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:56,440
He was a serious boy.

577
00:51:57,206 --> 00:51:59,948
He was loved by his superiors in the government office.

578
00:52:00,744 --> 00:52:03,143
I, too, have been looking forward to the future.

579
00:52:05,768 --> 00:52:08,846
You know what they say about the woman behind the crime.

580
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:14,776
He became corrupt because your daughter lured him away.

581
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:26,260
Are you saying that our Matsuko seduced Kazuo-san and got caught up in corruption?

582
00:52:26,745 --> 00:52:29,698
I can't think of anything else.

583
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,885
I have a letter from Kazuo.

584
00:52:33,776 --> 00:52:34,393
A letter?

585
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,659
My son would like to come home, but Matsuko won't let him go and he's in trouble.

586
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:44,651
If you like, I can show you this letter.

587
00:52:46,042 --> 00:52:50,557
Perhaps because I raised him with my own hands, he's a bit naive.

588
00:52:51,448 --> 00:52:53,323
he was controlled by her.

589
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,432
Does the family of the daughter who does this kind of dirty business have a relationship with a man who has a wife and children?

590
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:08,899
Mom.

591
00:53:10,922 --> 00:53:12,290
Our father is here.

592
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:25,795
The postmark is in Tokyo, so he must be somewhere in Tokyo.

593
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:26,759
Tokyo?

594
00:53:27,509 --> 00:53:32,043
When Matsuko arrives, please ask her to return my son to me.

595
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:38,116
It seems your husband is here.
I don't want to disturb you.

596
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:52,972
Don't worry about it.

597
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,960
Matsuko chose to live her life the way she did, and I'm sure she won't regret it.

598
00:53:57,713 --> 00:54:00,446
And even if she does, she'll take care of herself well.

599
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,469
It's not your fault, so there's nothing to worry about.

600
00:54:06,366 --> 00:54:09,219
She'll come back soon.

601
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:11,516
Get me the coat.

602
00:54:11,829 --> 00:54:12,602
Are you leaving?

603
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,350
I'll come here A FEW DAYS because I'm curious about Matsuko.

604
00:54:21,850 --> 00:54:22,883
Is there room available?

605
00:54:29,163 --> 00:54:30,489
Our guest will take this room.

606
00:54:30,757 --> 00:54:32,030
There's another room available.

607
00:54:32,617 --> 00:54:36,217
They want to stay this room.

608
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:50,952
Come in.

609
00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:57,759
That's terrible.
I've been studying so hard.

610
00:54:58,285 --> 00:54:59,139
You move?

611
00:54:59,669 --> 00:55:04,549
That's mine and Matsuko's room.
Don't use it for business from now on.

612
00:55:04,952 --> 00:55:06,479
I get it.

613
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:15,544
I want to go with dad.

614
00:55:16,007 --> 00:55:16,966
Where?

615
00:55:17,034 --> 00:55:18,414
Anywhere.

616
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:19,186
I get it.

617
00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:22,312
The stores in Nihonbashi are closed this Sunday, right?

618
00:55:23,672 --> 00:55:24,999
How did you know?

619
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:26,397
I checked it out.

620
00:55:26,966 --> 00:55:27,592
Ok?

621
00:55:28,407 --> 00:55:35,585
This holiday...
I have a union meeting.

622
00:55:36,452 --> 00:55:37,326
How about the night?

623
00:55:38,491 --> 00:55:41,098
We're going out to Hakone for the night.

624
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,351
That's boring.

625
00:55:42,486 --> 00:55:43,853
Don't act like kids.

626
00:55:44,137 --> 00:55:46,683
He's busy.

627
00:55:46,790 --> 00:55:47,703
Never mind.

628
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,600
Let's go with Takenosuke and mom someday.

629
00:56:03,153 --> 00:56:05,066
Here's your allowance.

630
00:56:06,622 --> 00:56:07,628
What are you doing?

631
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:10,295
It's ok.

632
00:56:18,716 --> 00:56:20,189
I'll see you off.

633
00:56:32,161 --> 00:56:33,288
I wanna go to the mountain.

634
00:56:33,715 --> 00:56:35,008
This is so great.

635
00:56:39,732 --> 00:56:41,046
I need a camera, too.

636
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:41,979
Why don't you buy it?

637
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:43,899
I don't have any money.

638
00:56:44,232 --> 00:56:45,126
Poor guy.

639
00:56:55,071 --> 00:56:56,538
Let's go eat at the cafe.

640
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,686
Oh yeah.

641
00:56:58,066 --> 00:56:59,786
What do you want?
Kid's lunch.

642
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,740
You are mean.

643
00:57:05,787 --> 00:57:06,214
This.

644
00:57:07,641 --> 00:57:08,501
This.

645
00:57:11,352 --> 00:57:14,619
I thought he went to Hakone.

646
00:57:24,048 --> 00:57:24,875
You shopping?

647
00:57:25,135 --> 00:57:25,855
Nothing.

648
00:57:27,321 --> 00:57:29,701
I thought your mom was with you.

649
00:57:30,231 --> 00:57:31,958
I thought you went to Hakone.

650
00:57:34,902 --> 00:57:36,155
Thank you, ma'am.

651
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:40,488
Let's go,Dad.

652
00:57:40,781 --> 00:57:42,034
I need something to eat.

653
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:45,231
Let's go to a cafe.

654
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:12,934
You're an idiot.
Don't cry.

655
00:58:13,799 --> 00:58:14,913
It's not our fault.

656
00:58:17,239 --> 00:58:20,079
We were born under such a star.

657
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:23,611
Our dad didn't mean to lie.

658
00:58:24,728 --> 00:58:26,401
He had his own plans.

659
00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:28,692
Bros.

660
00:58:32,492 --> 00:58:37,446
Don't you regret it?
They're our father's children, we're his children, too.

661
00:58:38,402 --> 00:58:38,975
You know that.

662
00:58:40,522 --> 00:58:43,542
Are you okay with that?

663
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:49,266
No..but It's all right.

664
00:58:49,885 --> 00:58:50,552
I hate you.

665
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:53,589
Hey, let's go see a movie.

666
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:55,563
I hate you.

667
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:22,722
Bath is empty.
Take a bath now.

668
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:27,573
It's heavy raining.

669
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,660
I will show Kirinoma's guest when they arrived.

670
00:59:31,293 --> 00:59:31,940
Thanks.

671
00:59:34,147 --> 00:59:36,067
I worry about Ume.

672
00:59:38,787 --> 00:59:40,747
She's probably at her friend's house talking.

673
00:59:41,866 --> 00:59:44,280
Shall I pick them up at the station?

674
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,222
It's heavy raining.

675
00:59:48,694 --> 00:59:50,927
You don't have to go.

676
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:56,023
I wonder if the water will run again.

677
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:08,043
Where's Ume?

678
01:00:08,703 --> 01:00:09,856
I worry.

679
01:00:12,661 --> 01:00:14,121
Something must have happened, today?

680
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,372
Maybe you got in a fight.

681
01:00:18,752 --> 01:00:21,565
It's nothing.
It's not our problem.

682
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:25,654
It's still our problem.

683
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:27,020
what does it mean?

684
01:00:37,130 --> 01:00:38,870
What time is it?

685
01:00:39,822 --> 01:00:43,336
She told me to leave from work at 10 pm.

686
01:00:43,378 --> 01:00:44,618
Shall I call them again?

687
01:00:45,083 --> 01:00:48,570
When you called earlier, they said she'd already left the store.

688
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:50,462
She left early, they said.

689
01:00:54,571 --> 01:00:56,404
Bros.

690
01:00:59,710 --> 01:01:01,810
I need your voice.

691
01:01:02,368 --> 01:01:04,861
Yuriko Hanagumi

692
01:01:06,144 --> 01:01:07,578
Call as Miyamoto.

693
01:01:07,957 --> 01:01:11,451
5497-567

694
01:01:11,825 --> 01:01:12,705
5497-567

695
01:01:12,852 --> 01:01:14,032
Call as Miyamoto.

696
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:15,522
Yuriko

697
01:01:23,727 --> 01:01:25,393
Hello?
Wakaba salon?

698
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:29,244
This is Miyamoto.
Is Yuriko from Hanagumi there?

699
01:01:30,918 --> 01:01:31,578
I see.

700
01:01:32,349 --> 01:01:33,036
She's there.

701
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,586
They told she left when I called them.

702
01:01:36,703 --> 01:01:38,390
Is Yuriko there?

703
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:40,601
It's me.

704
01:01:40,987 --> 01:01:42,953
Okada.

705
01:01:45,194 --> 01:01:48,241
Never mind.
Don't say excuse.

706
01:01:50,353 --> 01:01:52,680
Liar.
You didn't break up with Miyamoto, did you?

707
01:01:53,481 --> 01:01:56,001
I'll say goodbye to a woman like you for tonight.

708
01:01:56,484 --> 01:02:01,461
And then... those kimonos you collected at Mitsukoshi the other day, I'll take them back.

709
01:02:02,525 --> 01:02:04,265
You are an idiot.

710
01:02:26,677 --> 01:02:27,304
Then?

711
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:31,207
Because it's boring. I came home after playing pachinko.

712
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:34,671
Why didn't you come home with her?

713
01:02:34,897 --> 01:02:36,950
I didn't think it would come to this.

714
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:39,682
You could've told me.

715
01:02:39,827 --> 01:02:43,093
I'm sure you wouldn't be happy to hear it.

716
01:02:46,443 --> 01:02:48,097
She must be on her period today.

717
01:02:51,231 --> 01:02:52,378
I'm bad.

718
01:02:54,839 --> 01:02:55,852
I'm bad.

719
01:03:05,742 --> 01:03:07,202
Come here.

720
01:03:11,651 --> 01:03:15,644
Sorry but call me a woman.

721
01:03:16,072 --> 01:03:17,939
Young woman.

722
01:03:20,282 --> 01:03:22,629
We can't have suck a service.

723
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:25,899
I see... well then...

724
01:03:28,151 --> 01:03:30,071
He's an asshole.

725
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:27,608
Shut up!

726
01:04:57,837 --> 01:04:58,811
Is she back?

727
01:05:07,711 --> 01:05:08,371
Mom.

728
01:05:16,432 --> 01:05:17,085
Matsuko..

729
01:05:19,432 --> 01:05:20,565
It's been a while.

730
01:05:25,186 --> 01:05:26,712
Where have you been?

731
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:31,762
I'm not alone.

732
01:05:33,871 --> 01:05:34,924
Come in.

733
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:50,212
You meet him for the first time.

734
01:05:51,132 --> 01:05:52,406
I'm Sudo.

735
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,365
Anyway come in.

736
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:07,153
Tell Hatsue to get ready for the bath.

737
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,179
You don't have to go home?

738
01:06:23,089 --> 01:06:24,349
Not yet.

739
01:06:24,468 --> 01:06:26,742
We can talk about that later.

740
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:44,191
This used to be me and my sister's room.

741
01:06:55,164 --> 01:06:58,177
It's the same.

742
01:07:07,097 --> 01:07:08,757
I don't want to bother you.

743
01:07:11,241 --> 01:07:12,460
Want to go home.?

744
01:07:14,209 --> 01:07:15,536
I can't.

745
01:07:15,937 --> 01:07:17,190
Excuse me.

746
01:07:19,611 --> 01:07:20,484
Welcome.

747
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,245
It's been ages.

748
01:07:28,733 --> 01:07:29,846
I've changed, haven't I?

749
01:07:30,697 --> 01:07:34,324
I don't think so.
Please take a bath.

750
01:07:34,716 --> 01:07:35,723
Thank you.

751
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,067
Wanna take a bath?

752
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:48,109
You look down.

753
01:07:49,809 --> 01:07:51,222
You can leave if you want to.

754
01:07:54,094 --> 01:07:55,680
No one's going to say to leave.

755
01:07:57,826 --> 01:08:00,052
Are you going to rest now?

756
01:08:01,942 --> 01:08:04,082
Cheer up.

757
01:08:07,341 --> 01:08:09,327
You'd better get dressed.

758
01:08:27,488 --> 01:08:29,734
Don't do that.

759
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:57,377
He'd rather sleep than take a bath.
I'll wake him up later.

760
01:08:59,850 --> 01:09:02,430
I'm sorry, Mom.

761
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:05,777
After all, this is the only place I could stay.

762
01:09:10,731 --> 01:09:12,684
What the hell is going on with you?

763
01:09:13,295 --> 01:09:15,268
Can we please talk about this tomorrow?

764
01:09:16,698 --> 01:09:18,911
I'm tired.

765
01:09:19,678 --> 01:09:21,238
I'm worried about you.

766
01:09:25,743 --> 01:09:29,189
Take this.
You won't catch a cold.

767
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:30,129
Thank you.

768
01:09:32,002 --> 01:09:33,036
Where's Ume?

769
01:09:33,529 --> 01:09:35,516
She's still out.

770
01:09:36,661 --> 01:09:38,608
Has she started to fall in love yet?

771
01:09:38,828 --> 01:09:39,821
She's not like you.

772
01:09:40,902 --> 01:09:41,409
Ironic?

773
01:09:42,396 --> 01:09:43,229
It tastes good.

774
01:09:47,731 --> 01:09:49,651
You're really getting strong with the booze.

775
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,271
I've been practicing for two years.

776
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:56,796
Can I stay here for a while?

777
01:09:58,189 --> 01:09:59,602
I know you don't have anywhere else to go.

778
01:10:20,662 --> 01:10:22,748
Here's your home.

779
01:10:23,502 --> 01:10:24,882
Watch out.

780
01:10:25,984 --> 01:10:28,337
What's wrong?

781
01:10:28,664 --> 01:10:30,204
What did you do?

782
01:10:30,237 --> 01:10:31,464
No!

783
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:32,530
What's wrong?

784
01:10:32,798 --> 01:10:35,305
She wanted to go home, so we sent her home.

785
01:10:35,353 --> 01:10:37,167
I'm sorry to bother you.

786
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,945
She was so drunk she started crying.

787
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:43,727
Why you drunk?

788
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:45,300
I hate you!

789
01:10:46,929 --> 01:10:48,115
We're leaving.

790
01:10:48,522 --> 01:10:49,789
I'm sorry to bother you.

791
01:10:50,029 --> 01:10:51,775
Good night.

792
01:10:54,675 --> 01:10:55,474
Ume.

793
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,461
What's wrong?

794
01:11:06,896 --> 01:11:08,743
You've got to have that kind of energy.

795
01:11:09,589 --> 01:11:10,782
Let's have whiskey.

796
01:11:12,849 --> 01:11:13,766
Stay strong.

797
01:11:13,859 --> 01:11:15,339
I'll prepare the bed.

798
01:11:55,368 --> 01:11:58,368
Let's have whiskey.

799
01:11:59,054 --> 01:11:59,781
Yeah.

800
01:12:01,303 --> 01:12:03,929
I like you.
I hate mom.

801
01:12:06,236 --> 01:12:07,343
I hate dad more.

802
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:08,959
Umeyo.

803
01:12:11,461 --> 01:12:15,054
Do you remember me?

804
01:12:16,883 --> 01:12:17,857
Sis!

805
01:12:18,010 --> 01:12:21,383
Don't drink.

806
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:24,878
I wanted to drink.

807
01:12:25,690 --> 01:12:27,476
I like to drink.

808
01:12:27,589 --> 01:12:29,329
OKOK.

809
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:32,156
Let's have whiskey.

810
01:12:33,598 --> 01:12:36,384
Come on, Sis.

811
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:42,174
We are mistress club!

812
01:13:04,050 --> 01:13:05,230
Good night, ma'am.

813
01:13:05,683 --> 01:13:06,470
Good night.

814
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:38,797
She's sick.

815
01:13:42,865 --> 01:13:46,965
You've been in Kobe ever since you left.

816
01:13:48,302 --> 01:13:49,928
How did you know I was in Kobe?

817
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:52,061
I heard about it from the police.

818
01:13:55,834 --> 01:13:58,654
How did you end up like this with someone being chased by the police?

819
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:03,682
He has a wife and kids.

820
01:14:04,644 --> 01:14:06,384
Police told you so?

821
01:14:08,495 --> 01:14:10,149
I beg you, break up with him.

822
01:14:14,318 --> 01:14:17,898
Mr. Sudo may regret.

823
01:14:18,692 --> 01:14:20,226
How do you know that?

824
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:37,481
I beg you, break up with him.

825
01:14:40,139 --> 01:14:40,886
OK.

826
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,006
Really?

827
01:14:43,841 --> 01:14:44,807
But I have a condition.

828
01:14:45,034 --> 01:14:45,694
Conditions?

829
01:14:45,941 --> 01:14:47,354
Your will leave our father.

830
01:14:49,137 --> 01:14:51,191
It's our father's fault for making me the way I am.

831
01:14:54,578 --> 01:14:56,104
Can you leave him?

832
01:14:59,008 --> 01:15:02,148
If you can't, then I can't leave him either.
It's the same thing.

833
01:15:24,196 --> 01:15:25,689
You drunk too much.

834
01:15:26,075 --> 01:15:28,035
That's fine.
I'll pay for it.

835
01:15:28,694 --> 01:15:33,014
I'm worried about your health.

836
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:36,712
I don't care what happens to my body.

837
01:15:39,789 --> 01:15:43,629
I have to be clear.

838
01:15:45,087 --> 01:15:47,674
I can't allow two people to share one man.

839
01:15:49,036 --> 01:15:49,876
What?

840
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,257
You can't get him.

841
01:15:52,523 --> 01:15:56,769
He's mine.

842
01:15:58,264 --> 01:16:01,057
I won't give him back.

843
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:03,138
But he is...

844
01:16:03,832 --> 01:16:06,938
What's wrong with him?

845
01:16:08,462 --> 01:16:12,496
You said some strange things earlier.
Something about Sudo having regrets.

846
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:15,302
Why did you say that?

847
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,305
Speak up.

848
01:16:20,513 --> 01:16:22,086
Did you meet the people at Sudo's house?

849
01:16:27,150 --> 01:16:28,970
What did she say?

850
01:16:33,601 --> 01:16:34,248
Matsuko.

851
01:16:36,605 --> 01:16:41,198
He wants to go home.

852
01:16:44,485 --> 01:16:45,985
He miss his home.

853
01:16:47,258 --> 01:16:49,678
That's true?

854
01:16:52,686 --> 01:16:55,779
Mr. Sudo sent a letter home.

855
01:16:56,921 --> 01:16:59,821
I can't believe it.

856
01:17:00,646 --> 01:17:01,299
That's true.

857
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,197
Her mother brought it .

858
01:17:05,583 --> 01:17:07,469
Her mother brought it all the way here to show you?

859
01:17:37,691 --> 01:17:38,611
Matsuko.

860
01:17:40,038 --> 01:17:42,198
I beg you, break up with him.

861
01:17:42,871 --> 01:17:43,457
Mom.

862
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:47,678
He's the one who ran away from the police.

863
01:17:47,902 --> 01:17:49,116
That's even worse.

864
01:17:50,388 --> 01:17:51,841
I'm not like you.

865
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:57,954
I can't just walk away from someone, no matter who they are.

866
01:17:59,736 --> 01:18:01,809
I don't care if he's a thief or a murderer.

867
01:18:02,589 --> 01:18:04,516
If I love someone, I'll be with him until the day I die.

868
01:18:06,794 --> 01:18:10,801
I won't let him go even if I'd dead.

869
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,213
It's a wonder you had a child like me.

870
01:18:22,454 --> 01:18:26,460
I wonder if I'm really your child.

871
01:20:03,057 --> 01:20:04,777
Sis.

872
01:20:09,457 --> 01:20:11,223
Why don't you come upstairs for a minute?

873
01:20:11,808 --> 01:20:12,768
Why?

874
01:20:13,163 --> 01:20:15,416
I hear something strange.

875
01:20:15,922 --> 01:20:16,996
Please come.

876
01:20:29,479 --> 01:20:30,332
Look at that.

877
01:20:35,966 --> 01:20:36,500
See?

878
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:55,219
What's wrong?

879
01:20:55,566 --> 01:20:56,686
Where's spare key?

880
01:20:56,946 --> 01:20:57,593
Which room?

881
01:20:58,459 --> 01:20:59,446
Your sis..

882
01:21:03,963 --> 01:21:04,970
What's wrong?

883
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:06,816
I have no idea.

884
01:21:08,137 --> 01:21:09,457
Sis.

885
01:21:10,410 --> 01:21:11,077
Sis.

886
01:21:17,368 --> 01:21:19,748
Sis.
What's wrong?

887
01:21:20,888 --> 01:21:22,721
Is it forced suicide?

888
01:21:28,312 --> 01:21:30,206
Call doctor.

889
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:31,360
What's wrong?

890
01:21:31,447 --> 01:21:33,760
Sis killed the guy..

891
01:21:35,240 --> 01:21:35,740
Matsu..

892
01:21:38,919 --> 01:21:40,513
Stay strong.

893
01:21:40,839 --> 01:21:41,599
Mom!

894
01:21:46,789 --> 01:21:47,902
Stay strong.

895
01:21:49,675 --> 01:21:51,209
Hello?

896
01:21:52,339 --> 01:21:54,545
They can't be saved.

897
01:22:09,716 --> 01:22:10,343
Sis..

898
01:22:29,765 --> 01:22:30,772
Bros...

899
01:23:05,763 --> 01:23:08,509
I'm sorry for your loss.

900
01:23:08,997 --> 01:23:10,935
Thanks.

901
01:23:13,763 --> 01:23:17,755
Kazuo was killed.

902
01:23:22,474 --> 01:23:28,911
My only son.
He has a wife and children. It's not easy to kill a man like that.

903
01:23:31,202 --> 01:23:38,179
Husband's mistress and her daughter are so terrible.

904
01:24:04,342 --> 01:24:06,795
Did Matsuko leave anything out?

905
01:24:08,295 --> 01:24:12,756
She said she would never let go of the person she loves.

906
01:24:14,881 --> 01:24:19,740
She said she was a winner because she would be with him till death.

907
01:24:24,123 --> 01:24:25,561
she is strong-willed.

908
01:24:30,497 --> 01:24:35,302
I found her diary from two years ago in her purse.

909
01:24:38,973 --> 01:24:41,106
When I read it, I understood exactly how she felt.

910
01:24:42,130 --> 01:24:43,520
What did it say?

911
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:52,856
I was thrown away miserably by that man I trusted so much.

912
01:24:54,005 --> 01:24:58,755
The only reason is that our mother is a mistress.

913
01:25:00,489 --> 01:25:05,645
How is being the daughter of a mistress a negative thing for a human being?

914
01:25:07,856 --> 01:25:10,778
I have a father and a mother.

915
01:25:12,388 --> 01:25:19,723
Why am I not allowed to have the same kind of happiness as other people in the world?

916
01:25:22,411 --> 01:25:26,763
When Sudo left me, I wanted to curse my father and mother.

917
01:25:28,145 --> 01:25:31,411
But my father and mother are kind people to me.

918
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:37,872
I don't hate anyone
I will live on my own.

919
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:48,708
All I can hope for now is that my sister Umeyo will not have to repeat my misery.

920
01:25:51,545 --> 01:25:57,521
The sight of her innocent sleeping face weakens my resolve to leave home.

921
01:25:59,584 --> 01:26:00,599
Umeyo.

922
01:26:01,896 --> 01:26:06,763
I wish you all the best.
I'll be praying for you.

923
01:26:10,467 --> 01:26:17,388
she's great
She's so upset that she won't let anything happen to us.

924
01:26:20,467 --> 01:26:22,030
I didn't know.

925
01:26:23,397 --> 01:26:25,694
I guess she couldn't forget the first guy.

926
01:26:29,358 --> 01:26:31,959
Apparently Mr. Sudo wasn't as serious as his sister.

927
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:38,030
He got a wife from a good place within six months.

928
01:26:41,616 --> 01:26:43,163
I feel sorry for sis.

929
01:26:45,178 --> 01:26:48,155
Sudo was bad man.

930
01:26:48,655 --> 01:26:50,209
It was ok if he was killed.

931
01:27:01,131 --> 01:27:01,686
Mon.

932
01:27:02,827 --> 01:27:03,467
What?

933
01:27:04,077 --> 01:27:06,631
Pleas leave from our dad.

934
01:27:07,194 --> 01:27:07,702
Umeyo.

935
01:27:08,108 --> 01:27:12,663
I've been thinking about that for a long time.
I will start working from tomorrow.

936
01:27:13,913 --> 01:27:15,444
Please do too,bros.

937
01:27:18,264 --> 01:27:20,233
We have to look after this house.

938
01:27:20,803 --> 01:27:21,749
that's too sudden.

939
01:27:22,217 --> 01:27:24,694
I think this is a very good opportunity.

940
01:27:25,303 --> 01:27:27,295
I know how you feel but...

941
01:27:27,569 --> 01:27:28,741
But too soon.

942
01:27:28,766 --> 01:27:30,702
We were doing that, and we were screwed for life.

943
01:27:33,030 --> 01:27:36,272
Let's do our best on our own.

944
01:27:39,014 --> 01:27:45,146
I'm sure she felt the same way.

945
01:28:01,148 --> 01:28:02,757
I came here thinking you'd miss her.

946
01:28:04,992 --> 01:28:09,359
Sure enough.
They say if you cry too much, Buddha won't become a Buddha.

947
01:28:39,393 --> 01:28:40,120
Where's hatsue?

948
01:28:40,675 --> 01:28:42,104
she is going shopping.

949
01:28:43,003 --> 01:28:45,425
I see.

950
01:28:46,854 --> 01:28:48,651
I wanna hot tea.

951
01:29:04,871 --> 01:29:06,957
Do us a favor.

952
01:29:07,699 --> 01:29:08,785
What?

953
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:12,324
Let us live on our own.

954
01:29:15,098 --> 01:29:15,988
By yourselves?

955
01:29:18,168 --> 01:29:19,363
I don't understand.

956
01:29:24,098 --> 01:29:26,567
I want to support my mother on our own.

957
01:29:29,394 --> 01:29:30,073
You too?

958
01:29:38,426 --> 01:29:43,324
We want a brighter, healthier life.
We want a righteous life.

959
01:29:44,973 --> 01:29:47,996
We want to quit this business and we want to work.

960
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:57,207
I'm not as fastidious as Umeyo when it comes to the difficulties of the world. But I still feel sorry for our mother.

961
01:29:58,277 --> 01:29:58,949
Dad.

962
01:29:59,832 --> 01:30:05,590
I was so frustrated today at the crematorium, I wanted to punch her in the face.

963
01:30:07,113 --> 01:30:11,973
But it's frustrating but that's the way it is.
She's your mistress.

964
01:30:18,745 --> 01:30:21,831
Do you agree?
I told our dad.

965
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:34,027
I'll follow our kids.

966
01:30:37,784 --> 01:30:39,862
Our children have grown up so much!

967
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:43,487
Don't ever worry.

968
01:30:45,167 --> 01:30:46,292
We'll do our best.

969
01:30:57,929 --> 01:31:02,866
Let's do it, Dad.
I'm graduating next year, but tomorrow I'm walking to find a job.

970
01:31:03,937 --> 01:31:06,093
I think it's better for me if I do that, so I can be myself.

971
01:31:09,374 --> 01:31:10,218
I see.

972
01:31:12,382 --> 01:31:13,741
Have you all thought that much?

973
01:31:18,171 --> 01:31:22,905
I'm sorry I made you all feel so low because of me.

974
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,140
Maybe it was really me who let Matsuko die.

975
01:31:30,983 --> 01:31:33,351
I'm sorry.

976
01:31:34,671 --> 01:31:36,069
It's my fault.

977
01:31:38,226 --> 01:31:39,413
I was weak.

978
01:31:41,585 --> 01:31:43,358
But you have to believe on this.

979
01:31:45,148 --> 01:31:49,960
Your mother was never a common Mistress.

980
01:31:50,663 --> 01:31:53,663
I had no choice but to keep her away from me.

981
01:31:55,218 --> 01:31:59,569
I may have made you guys miserable, but it didn't have to be that way.

982
01:32:01,218 --> 01:32:05,452
We were going to be a couple to begin with.

983
01:32:05,491 --> 01:32:06,921
Don't say that.

984
01:32:08,265 --> 01:32:11,913
We may never get a chance to talk again.

985
01:32:14,851 --> 01:32:21,015
Your mother went with me to work at a store in Nihonbashi.

986
01:32:21,577 --> 01:32:26,671
Then suddenly it came to me that I was going to get married to the store's daughter.

987
01:32:30,233 --> 01:32:35,062
I was very confused due to my work.

988
01:32:36,491 --> 01:32:40,476
Your mother noticed this and went away.

989
01:32:43,226 --> 01:32:48,866
Matsuko was already in your mother's belly at that time.

990
01:32:53,038 --> 01:32:57,983
I didn't know that was going to happen, but I ended up with my now wife.

991
01:32:59,624 --> 01:33:02,022
I had a duty to them, and I just couldn't say no.

992
01:33:06,968 --> 01:33:12,186
I got married, and about a year later I ran into your mom.

993
01:33:13,913 --> 01:33:17,366
I couldn't contain myself any longer.

994
01:33:19,632 --> 01:33:22,296
It bothered me and it bothered her.

995
01:33:23,647 --> 01:33:31,834
Until today, I've tied your mother down.
I had no choice but to do that.

996
01:33:34,991 --> 01:33:35,976
That's all.

997
01:33:36,757 --> 01:33:44,358
That's the history of my mistakes that made your sister and all of you unhappy.

998
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:45,843
That's unfair.

999
01:33:46,874 --> 01:33:52,694
Under no circumstances is it very sinful for one man to have two wives!

1000
01:33:54,694 --> 01:33:56,468
You're too selfish.

1001
01:33:57,171 --> 01:33:59,608
No matter how much you suffer, your sins will not go away.

1002
01:33:59,633 --> 01:34:01,311
It's too late to sat that.

1003
01:34:01,336 --> 01:34:02,358
Shut up.

1004
01:34:02,944 --> 01:34:04,147
You are man.

1005
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:08,710
Since you are a man, you listen to what he has to say.

1006
01:34:09,358 --> 01:34:12,327
Do you accept the existence of your mistress?

1007
01:34:12,522 --> 01:34:18,444
No, but Even when it's unavoidable, if you really love each other, you can forgive.

1008
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:19,585
No at all.

1009
01:34:21,108 --> 01:34:23,381
You shouldn't be with another woman even though you have a wife.

1010
01:34:23,468 --> 01:34:30,881
But you know what, I don't have any real experience, but love isn't so cut and dried, is it?

1011
01:34:31,655 --> 01:34:34,507
Are you willing to kill someone as long as it's serious?

1012
01:34:36,233 --> 01:34:40,249
Are you willing to sacrifice other things to achieve love?

1013
01:34:40,733 --> 01:34:42,905
Is it okay to deviate from society's morals?

1014
01:34:43,038 --> 01:34:44,343
Stop saying that.

1015
01:34:44,421 --> 01:34:46,054
Umeyo is right.

1016
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:49,405
I'm sorry.

1017
01:34:50,288 --> 01:34:51,546
Forgive me.

1018
01:34:54,327 --> 01:34:56,218
I'm old-fashioned.

1019
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:08,638
Takenosuke,Take care of Mom.

1020
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:10,364
Ok?

1021
01:35:14,269 --> 01:35:16,769
I'm going to assume that our father is dead.

1022
01:35:19,386 --> 01:35:20,566
Umeyo too.

1023
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:55,744
You guys need to take care of yourselves.

1024
01:35:58,682 --> 01:36:03,962
I want you to grow up.
Okay?

1025
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:16,565
Dad.

1026
01:36:19,495 --> 01:36:21,268
Get out of the front today.

1027
01:37:06,103 --> 01:37:08,580
Mom, take him there.

1028
01:37:12,197 --> 01:37:13,213
Please.

1029
01:37:29,156 --> 01:37:34,296
Takenosuke.
You're going to the mountains again this summer

1030
01:38:58,927 --> 01:39:00,638
Have a drink.

1031
01:39:15,271 --> 01:39:18,545
I can't leave from you.

1032
01:39:20,631 --> 01:39:22,514
please say you won't break up with me.

1033
01:39:24,381 --> 01:39:25,826
Please take me anywhere.

1034
01:39:27,014 --> 01:39:31,193
I can't live without you.

1035
01:39:34,857 --> 01:39:37,686
I wanna stay with you.

1036
01:39:38,943 --> 01:39:41,279
I can't leave you like this.

1037
01:39:42,451 --> 01:39:43,600
I need you.

1038
01:39:44,248 --> 01:39:46,834
Don't say that.

1039
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:48,131
I need you.

1040
01:39:49,279 --> 01:39:51,912
I don't want to leave from you too.

1041
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:55,115
I want to run away together.

1042
01:39:55,287 --> 01:39:56,295
So.

1043
01:39:59,451 --> 01:40:04,443
Let's be people that Umeyo and Takenosuke will never laugh at us again.

1044
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,029
We were weak.

1045
01:40:10,833 --> 01:40:13,240
We have been living with a spoiled way of thinking.

1046
01:40:13,959 --> 01:40:16,092
I'm happy with it.

1047
01:40:19,936 --> 01:40:22,014
What if I make your children unhappy?

1048
01:40:29,170 --> 01:40:35,474
I'm in pain.
But let's start fresh around here, shall we?

1049
01:40:36,803 --> 01:40:40,037
If you need help, I'm here for you.

1050
01:40:41,264 --> 01:40:44,959
If you're not in the business now, you'll have to think about something else.
Don't worry about the money.

1051
01:40:47,154 --> 01:40:51,271
We'll help each other as human beings, even if we're separated.

1052
01:40:54,678 --> 01:40:56,068
Cheer up.

1053
01:40:57,865 --> 01:40:59,592
Let's put up with it for the sake of the kids.

1054
01:41:01,357 --> 01:41:09,427
It'll be like a memorial to the dead pineapple.
You got it?

1055
01:41:10,907 --> 01:41:11,680
Please.

1056
01:41:11,837 --> 01:41:14,211
I can't.

1057
01:41:15,032 --> 01:41:17,454
I can't.

1058
01:41:32,299 --> 01:41:36,252
mom isn't coming home
I wonder what happened to her?

1059
01:41:40,901 --> 01:41:41,909
I feel sorry for our mom.

1060
01:41:42,135 --> 01:41:43,190
Don't say that.

1061
01:41:43,698 --> 01:41:44,690
Why?

1062
01:41:46,604 --> 01:41:50,065
I feel like we killed her.

1063
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:05,751
It's mom!

1064
01:43:09,072 --> 01:43:09,853
Mom.

1065
01:43:12,658 --> 01:43:14,134
We were worried about you.

1066
01:43:15,634 --> 01:43:16,376
Mom.

1067
01:43:17,306 --> 01:43:18,861
Where have you been?

1068
01:43:19,970 --> 01:43:22,056
I was just down the street from your dad's house.

1069
01:43:22,603 --> 01:43:25,408
Okay.
Let's go home.

1070
01:43:38,828 --> 01:43:40,992
I'm quitting the business.

1071
01:43:43,826 --> 01:43:48,615
Let's sell the house and live together in a quiet place, just the three of us.

1072
01:43:50,404 --> 01:43:53,959
Let's start all over again from the beginning.

1073
01:43:55,498 --> 01:43:58,216
I finally made that decision.

1074
01:44:00,669 --> 01:44:02,732
We'll be fine for sure.

1075
01:44:02,888 --> 01:44:03,966
I'm with you.

1076
01:44:04,115 --> 01:44:05,169
Hey!

1077
01:44:45,602 --> 01:44:51,195
THE END

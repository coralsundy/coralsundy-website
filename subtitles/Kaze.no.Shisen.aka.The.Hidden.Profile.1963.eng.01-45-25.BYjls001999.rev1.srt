00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:16,892
<i>Kaze no shisen / The Hidden Profile (1963)</i>

3
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,822
Natsui,The teacher is surprised.

4
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:07,627
Why is that?

5
00:02:08,135 --> 00:02:11,682
You don't look like the kind of guy who'd leave his bride at a wedding and come here.

6
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,299
It can't be helped because it's work.

7
00:02:14,182 --> 00:02:17,190
I hear you and the bride are going to meet at Asamushi Onsen.

8
00:02:17,619 --> 00:02:18,322
She's probably there.

9
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:19,447
No wonder.

10
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:23,940
Well, Natsui-kun is very popular right now, so his wife will have to put up with him.

11
00:02:24,924 --> 00:02:29,940
We had to shoot with the same photographer for the next series.

12
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:32,455
Please don't worry about me.

13
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,580
If you want to take pictures, you should go to Mt.13.

14
00:02:36,033 --> 00:02:38,361
Mt. 13 is just beyond Goshogawara?

15
00:02:38,729 --> 00:02:39,354
Is it good place?

16
00:02:39,432 --> 00:02:41,658
There's nothing there.

17
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:44,088
I'd like to go there.

18
00:02:44,518 --> 00:02:51,994
You're supposed to be on your way to Hokkaido with your bride.
You don't have to go to Mt.13.

19
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,651
But if I miss it, I'll have to wait a year until next year.

20
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:58,502
Young people are so short-tempered.

21
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,486
I feel sorry for your bride.

22
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:43,116
Excuse me.

23
00:03:43,636 --> 00:03:44,386
Yes

24
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:46,722
Your husband is arrived.

25
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,541
Will you eat first?

26
00:04:04,814 --> 00:04:06,111
I'll take a bath first.

27
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:09,671
Did you have a meal?

28
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:12,116
I've been expecting you.

29
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:15,820
You shouldn't do that.

30
00:04:16,694 --> 00:04:17,960
My work is irregular.

31
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:22,030
It's easier for me if you don't have to wait for me.

32
00:04:24,655 --> 00:04:28,429
I'll show you to your bath.
You're welcome to join us.

33
00:04:29,593 --> 00:04:30,788
I'll take a bath later.

34
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,101
Have one drink.

35
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,874
Don't worry.

36
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:36,210
Just for toast.

37
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,851
I'll have a glass of juice.

38
00:04:41,342 --> 00:04:42,607
Anyway, congratulations.

39
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,146
I'll help it.

40
00:04:55,365 --> 00:04:56,951
Have you seen my work?

41
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:58,998
No, not yet.

42
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,068
I see.

43
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:04,662
Are you interested in photography?

44
00:05:05,061 --> 00:05:06,186
No, I'm not.

45
00:05:09,221 --> 00:05:14,339
My job is not like a regular working man's.
I don't know what I'd do for a job.

46
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:18,979
My life is hard enough for the money.

47
00:05:23,228 --> 00:05:24,423
I want to ask you for a favor.

48
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:30,071
Even if we live together from now on.
I'd like you to stay out of my life.

49
00:05:31,032 --> 00:05:33,595
I'll stay out of your affairs as long as I can.

50
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:36,181
I understand.

51
00:05:36,806 --> 00:05:39,095
Then we'll reschedule your trip.

52
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:43,767
We are going to Mt. 13, which is a very lonely place.
I really want to go there now.

53
00:05:45,024 --> 00:05:48,048
If you don't feel up to it, you can wait here.

54
00:05:49,851 --> 00:05:51,672
I'll go with you.

55
00:06:05,138 --> 00:06:11,622
To be honest, I'm not confident that I can make my partner happy through marriage.

56
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:16,778
That's not true.
I'm sure you would love her.

57
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:23,057
You can think that once I'm married, I'll settle down.

58
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,354
But that might take a long time.

59
00:06:28,901 --> 00:06:30,682
Or forever.

60
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:32,705
That's not true.

61
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:37,041
Don't think about all these things and just get married.

62
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:19,179
Someone's dead.
Just over there.

63
00:08:51,142 --> 00:08:51,761
Stay away.

64
00:09:07,848 --> 00:09:08,582
Here.

65
00:09:09,996 --> 00:09:11,653
Let's carry him out.

66
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,934
What are you doing?

67
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:17,184
What are you doing?

68
00:09:19,317 --> 00:09:21,200
I'm asking you.

69
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,887
The kids called me, there's a dead body.

70
00:09:27,832 --> 00:09:30,161
I'm a photographer.

71
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:33,286
She's your wife, isn't she?

72
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:37,996
You are a troubled people.

73
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,154
This will take some time.

74
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,030
I'm really sorry to have bothered you.

75
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:12,128
He killed himself.

76
00:10:12,518 --> 00:10:13,127
I see.

77
00:10:15,479 --> 00:10:18,612
If it was a homicide, you guys would have been in trouble.

78
00:10:20,675 --> 00:10:23,987
You're on your honeymoon.

79
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:27,472
It's cold.

80
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:39,986
I'm sorry we had to reschedule.

81
00:10:42,369 --> 00:10:43,392
No problem.

82
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:47,470
I just don't feel like going to Hokkaido anymore.

83
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:49,884
Anywhere is fine.

84
00:11:07,295 --> 00:11:08,342
Can we stay here?

85
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,944
Unfortunately, we are currently fully booked here.

86
00:11:13,623 --> 00:11:15,303
Let's go another inn.

87
00:11:28,407 --> 00:11:31,923
That's a passenger plane from Tokyo, landing at an airfield in Sendai.

88
00:11:32,407 --> 00:11:36,579
Some passengers use this flight for their return trip.
It lands at Haneda at 7:25.

89
00:11:54,646 --> 00:11:57,380
It seems kind of early to say goodbye like this.

90
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,021
Let's have tea somewhere.

91
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,208
It's better to say goodbye like this.

92
00:12:04,818 --> 00:12:07,372
A simple goodbye would be more appropriate.

93
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,153
Why?

94
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:14,661
I don't want to ruin the clean air of Sendai with a coffee shop in Tokyo or something.

95
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:17,677
You're not leaving like this, are you?

96
00:12:20,496 --> 00:12:23,160
I'd like to drink a little sake alone.

97
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:30,762
I'd rather go home alone.
I'll take the air of Sendai home with me.

98
00:12:31,754 --> 00:12:35,504
If they find out that we met in Sendai and came back together, they'll misunderstand.

99
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:41,621
My mother is a very nervous person.
But she believes everything I say.

100
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,152
Please don't worry.

101
00:12:46,629 --> 00:12:50,254
I'll be in a hotel for a week from today.

102
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:01,173
What are you thinking about?
About your husband.?

103
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:07,791
Thinking about Ryuzaki is pointless.

104
00:13:10,486 --> 00:13:14,611
He's living a carefree life in Singapore.

105
00:13:27,577 --> 00:13:28,944
It's been ages.

106
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:37,077
I'm on my way home.
See you.

107
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:59,454
I was in a hurry to get back.
Let's have another drink over there.

108
00:13:59,931 --> 00:14:01,642
You just said good bye.

109
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:03,720
Then come to my place.

110
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:04,868
Sorry.

111
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,790
You have to come.

112
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:12,353
Let's go.

113
00:14:13,087 --> 00:14:13,931
Roppongi

114
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:15,759
Where are you taking me?

115
00:14:16,298 --> 00:14:17,376
Put on the radio.

116
00:14:20,088 --> 00:14:21,392
A hotel.

117
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:22,963
Give me a break.

118
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,275
What's the matter?

119
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,853
What?

120
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,221
Don't pretend you don't know.

121
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:32,744
It's been half a year since I've seen you.

122
00:14:33,103 --> 00:14:34,986
I have work to do.

123
00:14:35,345 --> 00:14:36,806
What are you talking about?

124
00:14:37,791 --> 00:14:40,924
The customers are disappointed when you're not at bar.

125
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,416
Where have you been traveling?

126
00:14:46,741 --> 00:14:48,756
I went near Sendai on business.

127
00:14:49,647 --> 00:14:51,959
If you're near Sendai, you must have been in Matsushima.

128
00:14:52,577 --> 00:14:55,936
Not for work, but with someone,right?

129
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,834
You're drunk.

130
00:15:01,327 --> 00:15:02,702
You’re cold.

131
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,803
Go back to Namiki-dori.

132
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,699
I'll have it.

133
00:15:30,535 --> 00:15:31,511
Excuse me.

134
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:35,792
Mr. Natsui is here.

135
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,714
Send him into the parlor.

136
00:15:41,605 --> 00:15:43,699
Does he know Shigetaka?

137
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:49,988
Yes, he's a friend of mine.

138
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,910
You'd better not keep him waiting.

139
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:05,141
Hello.

140
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:06,626
Hello.

141
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,884
When did you get home?

142
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:10,650
This morning.

143
00:16:10,743 --> 00:16:11,923
You must be tired.

144
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,368
Not really.

145
00:16:15,587 --> 00:16:16,650
Where's your wife?

146
00:16:18,368 --> 00:16:19,197
I left her at home.

147
00:16:19,508 --> 00:16:21,414
I can't wait to meet your wife.

148
00:16:23,422 --> 00:16:26,625
How was your Honeymoon?

149
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:35,750
Thanks.

150
00:16:38,938 --> 00:16:41,359
How was your trip in Hokkaido?

151
00:16:42,571 --> 00:16:50,344
I changed my schedule and went to Mt. 13 on the edge of Aomori Prefecture and then to Matsushima.

152
00:16:51,555 --> 00:16:53,540
When did you go to Matsushima?

153
00:16:54,071 --> 00:16:55,493
The day before yesterday.

154
00:16:56,618 --> 00:16:57,938
Where did you stay?

155
00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:00,258
At a ryokan called Boryokaku.

156
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,219
I'm sure it was beautiful.

157
00:17:07,907 --> 00:17:08,602
Madam.

158
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,894
I guess my marriage didn't work out.

159
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:20,097
What are you talking about, just after you came back from your honeymoon.

160
00:17:23,183 --> 00:17:29,245
What happened?
I'm worried that you're in such a bad mood.

161
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,784
You're not responsible.

162
00:17:32,026 --> 00:17:34,355
But I'm the one who recommended to get married.

163
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:36,995
We seem to have different personalities.

164
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,003
You've only been married for 10 days.

165
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,839
I was wrong.

166
00:17:45,588 --> 00:17:54,308
Does that mean an arranged marriage?
Or does it mean that you did not have a relationship before marriage?

167
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:00,105
In that case, I would have blamed you.

168
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:06,667
When my friend was a matchmaker.
You said there was no need for a relationship.

169
00:18:07,315 --> 00:18:11,206
I did.
That's how I felt at the time.

170
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:16,698
I was going to marry her no matter who she was.

171
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:24,355
I mean that I shouldn't get married for the time being.

172
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:36,286
I'm not sure I can love her.

173
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,325
At the same time, I don't think she loves me either.

174
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:46,966
Even if our feelings are not immediately reciprocated, it is something that will happen in the future.

175
00:18:47,671 --> 00:18:50,421
I don't know how to explain it.

176
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:54,906
I think she and I both had a kind of resignation about marriage from the beginning.

177
00:18:56,937 --> 00:19:00,765
Chikako is the daughter of a decent family.

178
00:19:01,429 --> 00:19:03,609
She's still nervous.

179
00:19:04,999 --> 00:19:08,273
You should be nice to her.

180
00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:13,921
There's something in her past that's keeping me away from her.

181
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:18,687
No one is without a past.

182
00:19:20,999 --> 00:19:25,038
I'm going to devote myself to my work.

183
00:19:26,531 --> 00:19:32,820
What happened between her and me is no one's fault.
I just wanted to talk to you.

184
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:51,354
Chikako is here.

185
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,253
Yes, I understand.

186
00:20:01,753 --> 00:20:02,635
Tea is ready.

187
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,846
You guys just got married, but your wife is always staying at home.

188
00:20:10,206 --> 00:20:12,745
You are not strict.

189
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:15,003
That's because you're both responsible for each other now that you're married.

190
00:20:15,057 --> 00:20:18,792
He can't do his job if he keeps talking like that.

191
00:20:19,268 --> 00:20:21,557
I'll do it my way.

192
00:20:22,237 --> 00:20:24,050
I'm not gonna change who I am just because I'm married.

193
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:28,964
I mean, the thought of living with a certain woman for decades scares the shit out of me.

194
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,471
What's the hell?

195
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:34,081
I mean, if it makes you feel like you're doing your job, that's fine, too.

196
00:20:34,393 --> 00:20:39,721
I guess the game is on at the upcoming exhibition.
Let's see who comes out on top.

197
00:20:40,346 --> 00:20:41,245
We're ready.

198
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,120
Thank you very much.

199
00:20:56,587 --> 00:21:01,017
I won't be writing for a while, but I will return home once a month.

200
00:21:01,821 --> 00:21:05,532
I'll be gone on vacation for about two weeks.

201
00:21:06,087 --> 00:21:07,900
How're you?

202
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:12,892
Aya,I wonder if he was called back to headquarters.

203
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:19,079
It says "vacation", so I guess he's going back to Singapore.

204
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,579
I wonder why he's going back to Japan now.

205
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,093
Shigetaka must have a woman living with him over there.

206
00:21:32,476 --> 00:21:36,171
I don't know.

207
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:41,016
You must have married into an unhappy family.

208
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:48,703
I see you're going through the same trouble I am.

209
00:21:50,064 --> 00:21:52,197
I understand.
Even though I can't see.

210
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:59,134
Aya, please stay here as long as I live.

211
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:05,314
I don't have long to live, so please be patient until then.

212
00:22:07,931 --> 00:22:10,634
I'm going home.

213
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,322
Say hello to Yoshiaki.

214
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,205
Ayako.
Let me know as soon as you know when your husband will be back.

215
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:22,900
Take care.

216
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,411
Aya.

217
00:22:29,739 --> 00:22:34,192
Just leave him alone.
Think you are the one who grew up in this house.

218
00:22:34,856 --> 00:22:36,958
I think you're holding back too.

219
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:37,911
No...

220
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:45,958
Ever since my eyesight got worse.
He's become completely uninhibited and seems to bring something with him every time he comes over.

221
00:22:47,355 --> 00:22:51,769
I wonder if antiques are useful for his business.

222
00:22:53,136 --> 00:22:58,855
I'm not going to let Keiko take care of me, even though she's my daughter.

223
00:23:00,457 --> 00:23:04,879
Mother, I'll always be with you.

224
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:18,963
Hello?
Oh Ayako.

225
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,845
How are you doing?
I was wondering.

226
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:27,111
I'd like to see you tonight.

227
00:23:27,642 --> 00:23:29,791
Would you mind if I came to your hotel now?

228
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:33,166
I know you're busy.

229
00:23:34,017 --> 00:23:36,291
I'd like to talk to you directly.

230
00:23:40,762 --> 00:23:45,793
It's already late.
I think it's better if you stay at home today.

231
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:49,418
Stay there.

232
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:51,145
I get it.

233
00:23:53,212 --> 00:23:54,814
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

234
00:23:56,759 --> 00:24:02,267
Ryuzaki will be back soon.
That's why I'm feeling a little restless.

235
00:24:05,546 --> 00:24:06,304
See you.

236
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,507
I'm home.

237
00:24:18,801 --> 00:24:19,801
Chikako?

238
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:39,869
What are you doing?

239
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,001
Welcome back.

240
00:24:41,564 --> 00:24:42,767
What are you doing?

241
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,033
I didn't know you backed home.

242
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:48,642
That's not what I'm saying.
I'm asking why you're here.

243
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,963
You're an idiot.
Who'd come here alone now? Let's go home.

244
00:24:57,361 --> 00:24:58,338
You're shivering badly.

245
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,041
Because I'm cold.

246
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:03,088
Were you waiting for someone?

247
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,517
If You were, it wasn't me.

248
00:25:07,205 --> 00:25:08,822
I just felt lonely being alone.

249
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,095
If you're lonely, why don't you just ask him to go home?

250
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:14,205
I thought you were working.

251
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:17,730
Good night.

252
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,016
Your work is still the best.

253
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,695
You are the top.

254
00:26:32,289 --> 00:26:33,672
I lost and you won.

255
00:26:34,602 --> 00:26:36,625
I'll win next.

256
00:26:37,274 --> 00:26:40,820
The newspapers will pay attention to us.
It's good for our group.

257
00:26:41,703 --> 00:26:43,172
Oh Kuse's here.

258
00:26:48,672 --> 00:26:49,797
It's very crowded here.

259
00:26:49,822 --> 00:26:51,297
Thank you so much for all your help.

260
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:55,500
I talked to our cultural director and he told me to post the feedback as soon as possible.

261
00:26:56,758 --> 00:27:00,445
We've all been waiting since this morning for you to evaluate us.

262
00:27:00,922 --> 00:27:03,672
Let me take a look.

263
00:27:05,281 --> 00:27:10,508
Natsui-kun, you look very good.
You've really improved your skills since last year.

264
00:27:11,274 --> 00:27:12,735
You have a mysterious power.

265
00:27:13,843 --> 00:27:16,742
I didn't expect to run into a dead body.

266
00:27:17,257 --> 00:27:20,061
I was questioned a lot by the police.

267
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:26,664
I forgot to say... and congratulations on your wedding.

268
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:31,957
I see you've settled down now.

269
00:27:34,582 --> 00:27:36,746
He married old-fashioned.

270
00:27:37,332 --> 00:27:38,012
Hey.

271
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:42,496
He was lucky to meet a suicide corpse.
He went to a strange place on his honeymoon.

272
00:27:43,965 --> 00:27:47,129
Mr. Kuse went to Matsushima.
You went there too,right?

273
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:49,722
To Matsushima?

274
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:12,080
I'll be sure to take a look.

275
00:28:13,228 --> 00:28:19,361
What, six more days?
I'll make sure to visit you.

276
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:23,624
I think this color is very nice.

277
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:25,296
Yes.

278
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:31,601
Mr. Kuze is an enthusiastic man.
He brings Mr. Kuwabara with him.

279
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:36,233
But he's a strange one, isn't he?
I hear he's very close to Mrs. Ryuzaki.

280
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:38,335
Don't say bullshit.

281
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,890
Why?

282
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:44,515
Oh she's here.

283
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,093
Come on in. I'll show you around.

284
00:29:42,853 --> 00:29:44,634
Keep going.

285
00:29:46,431 --> 00:29:47,399
See you.

286
00:29:57,444 --> 00:29:59,162
You're awesome.

287
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:01,201
Please join me for dinner.

288
00:30:01,694 --> 00:30:04,420
You're the only one who can congratulate me on my future.

289
00:30:06,186 --> 00:30:07,475
Am I bothering you?

290
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,116
Just a little.
I'm still a housewife. I'm busy.

291
00:30:11,569 --> 00:30:12,217
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

292
00:30:17,895 --> 00:30:18,489
Where?

293
00:30:19,286 --> 00:30:20,567
Kichijoji

294
00:30:22,262 --> 00:30:23,887
It's too far.

295
00:30:24,997 --> 00:30:27,434
Around here ok.

296
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,614
I'd like you to do as I please for today.

297
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:32,559
I think I've succeeded.

298
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,020
What's in Kichijoji?

299
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:38,294
There is a restaurant that serves delicious country cuisine.

300
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:40,614
Isn't your husband supposed to be home by now?

301
00:30:41,231 --> 00:30:42,020
He's always late.

302
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:43,505
Don't you miss him?

303
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:44,653
I miss him.

304
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,324
Sometimes I wish he was a normal office worker.

305
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:50,481
Oh, everyone at work is jealous of you.

306
00:30:51,614 --> 00:30:55,302
It's an unusual job, and I hear he's a big star.

307
00:30:56,677 --> 00:30:57,997
Let me show you a picture.

308
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:03,419
He took this.

309
00:31:08,698 --> 00:31:13,011
What's this?
I don't know what it is, but it's beautiful.

310
00:31:13,894 --> 00:31:16,394
It's still a lot better than being a regular office worker.

311
00:31:16,565 --> 00:31:17,753
How's your workers?

312
00:31:17,987 --> 00:31:19,214
We're fine.

313
00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:23,323
Oh, yes, Mr. Ryuzaki.
He's coming back from Singapore tomorrow.

314
00:31:30,747 --> 00:31:32,309
Thank you for the food.

315
00:31:33,153 --> 00:31:37,176
It's been a long time since I've had something so rare and delicious.

316
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,411
I never thought I'd be eating at a place like this with you.

317
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:43,950
I can't believe it.

318
00:31:44,379 --> 00:31:47,153
Don't be hesitate.

319
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:53,872
Shall we go home now?
My mother's waiting for me.

320
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:04,390
The most precious time passes so quickly, doesn't it?

321
00:32:17,551 --> 00:32:18,731
Excuse me.

322
00:32:21,801 --> 00:32:23,411
Check please.

323
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,489
Call a cab.

324
00:32:25,895 --> 00:32:29,840
Would you like to wait 20 minutes?
It's busy today.

325
00:32:31,106 --> 00:32:33,895
5 minutes by car

326
00:32:34,442 --> 00:32:36,989
I'll go on foot.

327
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,403
It's cold.

328
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:40,004
I'm fine.

329
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:55,342
It's been years since I've walked in the fog.

330
00:32:55,991 --> 00:33:00,882
Ma'am.
As I told you before, my marriage was a failure.

331
00:33:01,882 --> 00:33:03,929
I'm afraid it's only going to make us both unhappy.

332
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:08,905
What's the hell?
Your wife loves you?

333
00:33:09,218 --> 00:33:12,046
I can't get a grasp of her feelings.

334
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:14,921
But I think that's understandable.

335
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,210
After all, I myself can't give my heart to my wife.

336
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:20,343
It's my fault.

337
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:21,585
Why do you say that?

338
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:28,374
What?
You know.
And you're asking me because you know.

339
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,790
I can't be married to anyone.

340
00:33:35,087 --> 00:33:38,736
I'm not saying that my wife is bad.
I married too soon.

341
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,689
What are you talking about?
You married her.

342
00:33:44,283 --> 00:33:47,798
I know there's no point in making excuses.
I never said this to anyone.

343
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,087
Is this the first time you've told me that?

344
00:33:50,837 --> 00:33:54,611
I would like someone to be honest with me and tell me.

345
00:33:56,814 --> 00:34:00,111
I always think for myself.

346
00:34:00,478 --> 00:34:09,611
You're talking to someone.
I think that person is much more mature, much more thoughtful, and much more attractive than I am.

347
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:15,485
Don't give me boring advice.

348
00:34:16,008 --> 00:34:17,110
Let's go.

349
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:19,563
I'm sorry if I was out of line.

350
00:34:19,774 --> 00:34:23,414
But for the record, just the thought of having someone like that in your life irritates me.

351
00:34:24,047 --> 00:34:28,726
You may despise me.
The fact that my marriage was a failure is also because I met you before.

352
00:34:28,797 --> 00:34:30,024
I don't want to hear it.

353
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:32,773
It's fine as is.
If it doesn't reach your ears, that's fine.

354
00:34:33,141 --> 00:34:36,336
I don't feel comfortable doing this anymore.
I've always loved her.

355
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,633
You know how I feel.

356
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,086
That's why you asked me to marry her.

357
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:51,946
When I heard about it from a friend, I thought it would be a great match.

358
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:56,196
You tried to keep me away from her.

359
00:34:56,516 --> 00:34:57,883
Don't tell me.

360
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:02,735
 you know Kuse.

361
00:35:04,797 --> 00:35:06,938
Why are you suddenly saying that?

362
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,985
I'll confess.

363
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:12,610
The image I have drawn near you is Kuse.

364
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,711
I know him.

365
00:35:17,813 --> 00:35:20,649
If I see him, I will at least say hello.

366
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:28,519
Don't say that. It's rude.

367
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:38,526
I'm sorry.
I can't even look up.

368
00:35:39,878 --> 00:35:44,464
But I wish I had met you long, long ago.

369
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:14,531
There is a peninsula jutting out from the east of Kyushu, isn't there?

370
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:17,250
It's called Kunisaki Peninsula.

371
00:36:17,938 --> 00:36:21,570
A cultural zone was established there in the 12th century.

372
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:26,086
Now it's all gone, and the only remnants of it are the Buddha images on the cliffs.

373
00:36:26,508 --> 00:36:28,172
Here's your coffee.

374
00:36:29,609 --> 00:36:35,766
I want you to go out there and photograph with your own eyes the remains of an old culture that has died out deep in the mountains.

375
00:36:36,524 --> 00:36:38,555
What do you think?

376
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:41,711
I'll do it.

377
00:36:42,906 --> 00:36:47,734
Our magazine has a reputation for respect.

378
00:36:47,938 --> 00:36:50,922
It's a big project.
I'm counting on you.

379
00:37:11,528 --> 00:37:12,192
Hi.

380
00:37:12,224 --> 00:37:14,262
Welcome back.

381
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:15,708
How's your mom doing?

382
00:37:15,848 --> 00:37:19,309
She's fine.
She's very much looking forward to you

383
00:37:20,411 --> 00:37:21,848
Welcome back.

384
00:37:28,793 --> 00:37:31,262
As soon as you get off the plane in Japan, the air is damp.

385
00:37:33,481 --> 00:37:36,770
Hey, look at that.
That woman standing in the lobby.

386
00:38:02,147 --> 00:38:04,303
The girl who went to headquarters before.

387
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:06,796
She's here to pick you up?

388
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:08,100
No way.

389
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:10,671
I forgot her name.

390
00:38:12,233 --> 00:38:14,335
Chikako Nonomura?

391
00:38:29,837 --> 00:38:32,235
What kind of business did you come to Japan for?

392
00:38:32,821 --> 00:38:34,415
why do you ask me that?

393
00:38:34,907 --> 00:38:36,618
It's so sudden

394
00:38:37,516 --> 00:38:42,821
It just occurred to me.
Are our important documents still in that safe?

395
00:38:44,457 --> 00:38:47,145
Go to the Prince Hotel in Akasaka.

396
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,137
Why don't you go home tonight?

397
00:38:50,551 --> 00:38:52,160
That won't be necessary.

398
00:39:04,947 --> 00:39:06,767
What's wrong?

399
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:09,025
I'm tired.
I'd like to stay here tonight and relax.

400
00:39:09,517 --> 00:39:11,908
I beg you to excuse my selfishness.

401
00:39:12,165 --> 00:39:13,704
my mother's expecting you.

402
00:39:14,306 --> 00:39:15,978
Tell her I said hello.

403
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,993
Mr. Tsuchiyama.
I'd like to talk to you... if you'll stay here.

404
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,853
Ayako, let's go home.

405
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:31,118
Thank you for coming all the way .

406
00:39:39,925 --> 00:39:41,777
I'll get ready.

407
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:44,433
Can you at least look at me when you're talking to me?

408
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:46,612
Sorry.

409
00:39:47,378 --> 00:39:49,894
You go out without telling me and you come back without telling me.

410
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,917
That's fine.
But if you're asked, at least answer.

411
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,308
If you're gonna have coffee, bring a cup.

412
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:06,301
I'm not the kind of man who would have a problem with your past.

413
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:13,215
Now that we're married, I'm very curious about our life together.

414
00:40:14,441 --> 00:40:15,949
I'm sorry.

415
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,543
I don't care.
 I don't know what you're talking about.

416
00:40:21,457 --> 00:40:24,933
I'm a selfish man, but you're selfish.
right?

417
00:40:27,144 --> 00:40:33,769
We're just two people living together, but we're both living in our own separate worlds.

418
00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:48,787
I'm leaving for Kyushu tomorrow.
It's perfect... to be alone with each other... to think things over.

419
00:40:50,138 --> 00:40:52,138
I can't go on like this.

420
00:40:55,834 --> 00:40:59,076
So Nonomura became a photographer's wife.

421
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,099
I don't know the details.

422
00:41:02,052 --> 00:41:04,623
How long have you been in a relationship?

423
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:06,568
Not much.

424
00:41:07,443 --> 00:41:10,623
I wonder if what happened with you was the reason she left the company.

425
00:41:11,795 --> 00:41:12,537
I have no idea.

426
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:16,185
But she came to pick you up at the airport.

427
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:19,631
I guess my wife knew about her.

428
00:41:21,506 --> 00:41:27,193
You know, one day your wife showed me a picture of that girl and asked me who she was.

429
00:41:28,982 --> 00:41:31,318
Is Chikako Nonomura an arranged marriage?

430
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,904
You seem to care a lot.

431
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,959
It doesn't matter.
You're the one who dumped her.

432
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:41,927
Please do some research on who her matchmaker is.

433
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:47,412
You shouldn't do that.
I'd feel sorry for her if she goes crazy.

434
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:51,232
Maybe it was my wife who got her married.

435
00:41:51,732 --> 00:41:52,834
I can't believe it.

436
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:55,802
She's like that.
I hate women like that.

437
00:41:56,685 --> 00:41:58,826
But she's doing well.

438
00:41:59,232 --> 00:42:02,787
She's not my wife, she's a decoration in the Ryuzaki household.

439
00:42:03,232 --> 00:42:05,310
She just takes care of my mother.

440
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:07,943
I don't know how she put up with it.

441
00:42:09,154 --> 00:42:11,802
She wants to leave, but I won't let her.

442
00:42:13,427 --> 00:42:16,834
I'll divorce her when she wants to be with me

443
00:42:29,949 --> 00:42:31,363
Ryuzaki Speaking

444
00:42:42,754 --> 00:42:46,957
Have you heard from Shigetaka?

445
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:48,496
No, nothing.

446
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:50,895
I see.

447
00:42:51,707 --> 00:42:56,043
It's been three days. He must be busy since he left.

448
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,473
He's a selfish man, isn't he?

449
00:43:00,004 --> 00:43:03,527
He doesn't care about me anymore.

450
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:06,668
You think too much, mother.

451
00:43:07,473 --> 00:43:10,793
You should take it easy on yourself. It's not good for you.

452
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:12,692
Thanks.

453
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:21,473
I have not had a single day of peace of mind since I married into this family.

454
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:28,942
Shigetaka's grandfather and father were both socially respectable people.

455
00:43:29,793 --> 00:43:34,020
But when they entered our house, they were very slovenly.

456
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:35,720
Mother.

457
00:43:40,462 --> 00:43:42,470
It was hard for me.

458
00:43:45,063 --> 00:43:47,985
I don't have anyone to listen to my complaints.

459
00:43:49,056 --> 00:43:55,470
I'm just trying to take care of this house and keep it and grow old.

460
00:43:57,110 --> 00:44:01,345
But it must be a family that deserves it.

461
00:44:02,024 --> 00:44:05,110
Everyone in our family has lived a spectacular life.

462
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:07,431
You think so?

463
00:44:09,931 --> 00:44:12,110
Oh yes.

464
00:44:13,126 --> 00:44:16,001
You should go to higetaka's place now.

465
00:44:16,993 --> 00:44:22,095
He lives in a hotel and there might be some inconvenience.
Anyway, tell him to go home.

466
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:26,259
Madam,there's a call for you from Kuse.

467
00:44:33,352 --> 00:44:34,203
Hello?

468
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,024
I suddenly wanted to meet you.

469
00:44:38,219 --> 00:44:41,055
Could you come to the usual place in Hibiya?

470
00:44:42,516 --> 00:44:43,828
I see.

471
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,477
I'll be there.

472
00:44:50,899 --> 00:44:51,547
Hello?

473
00:44:51,812 --> 00:44:53,734
This is the front desk.

474
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:56,086
There is a lady named Ms. Soeda.

475
00:44:56,766 --> 00:44:57,610
Soeda?

476
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:02,282
Let her through here, please.

477
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,649
We are police.

478
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:08,508
There's a Ryuzaki Shigetaka staying here.

479
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:09,813
Yes.

480
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,789
Room 416.

481
00:45:15,211 --> 00:45:15,977
Please come in.

482
00:45:34,345 --> 00:45:36,103
I knew it was you.

483
00:45:38,681 --> 00:45:43,010
It's been a while.
I recognized you when you said Soeda.

484
00:45:48,687 --> 00:45:53,046
That's a name I've missed.
It used to be a common name between us.

485
00:45:54,093 --> 00:45:56,515
Now it's Natsui Chikako?

486
00:45:58,874 --> 00:46:01,390
I heard it from a friend.
Have a seat.

487
00:46:11,035 --> 00:46:11,566
Have a seat.

488
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,793
You came to Haneda the other day.

489
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:21,386
I was hoping you'd be here today.

490
00:46:21,957 --> 00:46:25,144
That's one reason I didn't go home. I was waiting for you.

491
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,691
I'm surprised you found me here.

492
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:31,261
I called the office.

493
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:35,410
Yes.

494
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,774
I ordered coffee right away.

495
00:46:44,188 --> 00:46:45,735
We often had coffee together before.

496
00:46:47,008 --> 00:46:47,672
Please leave.

497
00:46:52,154 --> 00:46:55,966
I was surprised when I saw you at Haneda.
I was so happy.

498
00:46:56,771 --> 00:46:59,920
It was nice to see you remember me after the way we parted.

499
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:05,724
Two and a half cups of sugar, no milk.

500
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:09,763
You're a coffee drinker.

501
00:47:14,782 --> 00:47:20,321
I think Ryuzaki has returned to Japan, and I am no longer at peace with that.

502
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:26,861
You are Ryuzaki's wife, so I can't help it

503
00:47:28,017 --> 00:47:30,118
I can't get my feelings in order.

504
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:38,525
I am also relieved that Ryuzaki is staying at a hotel.

505
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,923
Why don't you talk to Ryuzaki again?

506
00:47:43,923 --> 00:47:45,298
Maybe you can get a divorce.

507
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:47,220
I can't.

508
00:47:49,056 --> 00:47:52,931
Besides, I want to stay in that house as long as my mother is there.

509
00:47:53,587 --> 00:47:57,345
If you're tied down by that...
We'll end up like this forever.

510
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:06,978
I was drinking alone by the time Ryuzaki's plane arrived in Haneda.

511
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:10,782
I couldn't stop drinking.

512
00:48:11,134 --> 00:48:12,220
Sorry.

513
00:48:13,946 --> 00:48:18,587
I too was inconsolable and all I could think about was you.

514
00:48:20,595 --> 00:48:25,986
You and I will grow old, tied to a life with someone we don't love.

515
00:48:27,892 --> 00:48:28,986
I'm lonely.

516
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:34,189
Your wife must be lonely.

517
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,298
She's fine.

518
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:40,446
We've been strangers for a long time.

519
00:48:42,407 --> 00:48:46,868
He's just stubborn and won't leave me.
It's a strange life.

520
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:54,798
I've been with a lot of women before I met you.

521
00:48:55,907 --> 00:48:57,079
I'm a flawed man.

522
00:48:58,243 --> 00:49:02,860
I thought it would be mutually beneficial for both of us to leave my wife, and we've talked about it a few times.

523
00:49:03,728 --> 00:49:07,548
But every time I do, she turns away.

524
00:49:09,189 --> 00:49:13,798
You know we're both unhappy.
I don't know how she feels about that.

525
00:49:14,954 --> 00:49:17,306
She loves you.

526
00:49:18,814 --> 00:49:20,696
Is there such a way to love?

527
00:49:21,736 --> 00:49:25,618
I don't want to.
That kind of egoism, that kind of love.

528
00:49:27,853 --> 00:49:29,532
You must be running out of love for this man.

529
00:49:32,439 --> 00:49:37,306
No, sir.
There are all kinds of men out there.

530
00:49:38,056 --> 00:49:40,611
I've been thinking about that recently.

531
00:49:46,308 --> 00:49:49,707
I heard Natsui-kun got married.

532
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:56,004
I know how Natsui-kun felt about you.

533
00:49:56,199 --> 00:49:58,082
Please don't talk about Mr. Natsui

534
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:02,433
Was it Ayako who suggested marriage?

535
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,480
I'm sure his wife is a lovely woman.

536
00:50:09,629 --> 00:50:14,160
I just find his heart somewhat pathetic.

537
00:50:15,918 --> 00:50:20,285
You and I are both people who know the horrors of marriage.

538
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,027
Please don't talk about Mr. Natsui

539
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:34,541
While we're here, I want to forget about everything else and think about just the two of us.

540
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:38,743
Even if it's just a dream.

541
00:50:39,346 --> 00:50:41,838
Just Kuse and me.

542
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:48,628
You are as selfish as a child.

543
00:50:49,355 --> 00:50:50,909
Only to you.

544
00:50:52,495 --> 00:50:55,605
We'll only be together for a short time.

545
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:02,722
I don't want to talk about other people in that short time.

546
00:51:08,695 --> 00:51:11,664
Are you and your husband getting along?

547
00:51:13,844 --> 00:51:16,492
I never thought you'd be a photographer's wife.

548
00:51:17,625 --> 00:51:19,008
Love marriage?

549
00:51:27,555 --> 00:51:30,156
What's up with that?
You won't tell me what's going on, no matter what I ask.

550
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:33,680
I'm leaving.

551
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,890
Leaving?
Then what are you doing here?

552
00:51:38,625 --> 00:51:42,226
We haven't seen each other in a long time. You could stay and talk some more.

553
00:51:44,414 --> 00:51:47,828
I don't think I have anything to say to you.

554
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,961
You're a curious woman.

555
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:59,504
You're mine.
That's why we're here.

556
00:53:03,371 --> 00:53:04,278
Get your hands off of me!

557
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:06,348
Hold on.

558
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:09,324
I'm sorry.

559
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:14,551
I'm leaving.

560
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:20,284
When I left you, I told you to marry someone and happy.

561
00:53:21,855 --> 00:53:24,379
But you're not happy.

562
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:27,683
I'm leaving.

563
00:53:29,222 --> 00:53:30,761
I'm not the same person I was before.

564
00:54:17,414 --> 00:54:22,844
I'm going abroad.
It's no longer possible for us to continue like this forever.

565
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:24,680
What will happen to me?

566
00:54:25,141 --> 00:54:29,071
I want you to forget who I am.
Pretend you've never met me.

567
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:31,875
I can't.

568
00:54:32,805 --> 00:54:36,586
You're going to marry someone else.
That's your new start.

569
00:55:29,114 --> 00:55:31,520
I'm in the mountains of Kyushu.

570
00:55:32,348 --> 00:55:35,309
I'd like you to hear me speak frankly about my feelings right now.

571
00:55:35,973 --> 00:55:41,942
Ever since I married you, things have been different between us.

572
00:55:43,083 --> 00:55:47,841
I'm not really sure if this is my fault or yours.

573
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:52,028
Before I knew you, I was attracted to a certain woman.

574
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:56,153
You may think it's terrible that I'm telling you this now.

575
00:55:57,169 --> 00:56:03,567
But at the time, I believed that we could have a happy family without having to confess this to you.

576
00:56:04,513 --> 00:56:08,434
I had thought that marriage would take her out of my heart.

577
00:56:09,544 --> 00:56:12,333
But I guess I was wrong.

578
00:56:13,106 --> 00:56:14,880
I'm sure you have your reasons.

579
00:56:15,817 --> 00:56:18,192
But I'm not going to ask you about any of them.

580
00:56:19,044 --> 00:56:27,684
But at this point, you and I need to separate, live separately, and think things over.

581
00:56:28,810 --> 00:56:33,474
I will continue my trip to Kyushu for a while after this job is done.

582
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:39,966
After you read this letter, I ask you to take your own liberties.

583
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:45,599
When I return to our apartment, I want you to keep all your things out of my sight.

584
00:56:46,443 --> 00:56:49,521
I will not ask you where you are.

585
00:56:50,552 --> 00:56:54,451
I'd like to hear what you have to say about Singapore and put it in our magazine.

586
00:56:54,521 --> 00:56:58,865
I don't want to show my face in such a place, since I'm back on personal business this time.

587
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,482
I would like a brief article and one photo

588
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:03,060
My photo?

589
00:57:03,482 --> 00:57:07,623
I'll bring my photographer, Natsui, to visit you when it's convenient for you.

590
00:57:07,974 --> 00:57:08,919
Natsui?

591
00:57:46,789 --> 00:57:48,750
I saw your letter.

592
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,477
I really think you are right.

593
00:57:52,422 --> 00:57:57,836
I think we had a strange marriage with too little understanding and not enough wisdom.

594
00:57:59,133 --> 00:58:03,250
I was not worthy to be your wife.

595
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:09,766
I was a wife who could not serve you in any way during our short time together.

596
00:58:11,219 --> 00:58:13,070
I am deeply sorry.

597
00:58:13,594 --> 00:58:18,289
I thought your work was wonderful, even though I didn't know you very well.

598
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:22,680
I wish you the best of luck with your work.

599
00:58:36,585 --> 00:58:41,671
Our exhibition was a great success, and I'd love to have you organize another one.

600
00:58:42,046 --> 00:58:45,546
I'd like to introduce folk dances from around the world.

601
00:58:45,835 --> 00:58:46,781
That's good.

602
00:58:47,484 --> 00:58:50,648
So far, all your projects have been a success.
Give it a try.

603
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:52,867
Let's get started on something plan.

604
00:58:53,273 --> 00:58:54,460
I have a phone call for you.

605
00:58:59,874 --> 00:59:01,694
I'm sorry to call you at a time when you're so busy.

606
00:59:04,046 --> 00:59:05,804
I'd like to talk to you again.

607
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:19,240
I'll be waiting for you at 7:00.

608
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:21,802
I'm sorry .

609
00:59:23,279 --> 00:59:25,224
I'll be waiting.

610
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:34,980
I'm glad to hear you're doing well.

611
00:59:35,777 --> 00:59:39,472
Thank you.
I'm glad you're well, too.

612
00:59:39,832 --> 00:59:42,793
I'm very well, but I've been unnecessarily busy.

613
00:59:43,105 --> 00:59:44,230
Welcome home.

614
00:59:44,496 --> 00:59:47,527
The magazine people will be here at 1:00, so please put them in the parlor.

615
00:59:47,855 --> 00:59:49,629
They have a cameraman coming.

616
00:59:50,347 --> 00:59:51,660
You have to stay with us.

617
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:54,387
You're really busy, aren't you?

618
00:59:55,551 --> 00:59:58,222
I'll be back later.

619
01:00:06,309 --> 01:00:12,380
Did Shigetaka tell you anything about the house?

620
01:00:12,919 --> 01:00:16,020
He asked me to hold off because he wanted to see the inventory.

621
01:00:16,184 --> 01:00:17,442
Inventory?

622
01:00:18,966 --> 01:00:20,809
What would he do with such a thing?

623
01:00:23,977 --> 01:00:28,477
Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries have very strong ethnic feelings.

624
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:32,493
They're very antipathetic toward whites, but extremely friendly toward Japanese.

625
01:00:33,134 --> 01:00:38,103
If we can take advantage of that sentiment, Japanese exports could still grow considerably.

626
01:00:40,361 --> 01:00:41,619
Welcome.

627
01:00:54,830 --> 01:00:56,221
That's enough.

628
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:58,166
Thank you very much.

629
01:00:58,299 --> 01:01:00,135
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

630
01:01:00,697 --> 01:01:02,127
I'm Sumiya.

631
01:01:04,908 --> 01:01:07,041
Mr. Natsui, it's been a while.

632
01:01:07,744 --> 01:01:09,025
Did you know him?

633
01:01:09,174 --> 01:01:10,572
Yes.

634
01:01:11,353 --> 01:01:13,869
He's been visiting us from time to time.

635
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,674
I didn't know that at all.

636
01:01:16,775 --> 01:01:17,564
Have a seat.

637
01:01:18,306 --> 01:01:19,791
Have a seat too.

638
01:01:20,174 --> 01:01:23,174
Natsui is still young, but very talented.

639
01:01:23,658 --> 01:01:26,767
He had an exhibition recently, and it was very well received.

640
01:01:26,939 --> 01:01:28,978
I wish I could have seen it.

641
01:01:30,322 --> 01:01:34,869
I don't mean to be rude, but...
Of course you're still single, aren't you?

642
01:01:35,088 --> 01:01:37,963
I got married about a month ago.

643
01:01:38,392 --> 01:01:42,330
Congratulations.
Then this must be the best time for you.

644
01:01:43,322 --> 01:01:45,635
Of course you're married for love.

645
01:01:46,142 --> 01:01:47,486
He did arranged marriage.

646
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,478
That's unusual.

647
01:01:50,369 --> 01:01:52,150
Who's your matchmaker?

648
01:01:53,158 --> 01:01:54,557
Your friend?

649
01:01:56,862 --> 01:01:59,268
Where did you go for your honeymoon?

650
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,994
He was too busy with work.

651
01:02:03,830 --> 01:02:06,127
He met the bride at Asamushi Onsen.

652
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:08,627
It's a busy trip.

653
01:02:08,932 --> 01:02:13,455
Speaking of Tohoku, you stayed in Matsushima, right?

654
01:02:14,752 --> 01:02:18,885
Ayako.
I heard you also went to Matsushima just a month ago.

655
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:20,408
Alumni reunion

656
01:02:23,093 --> 01:02:27,999
It's funny how you bump into people you know in the strangest places.

657
01:02:37,399 --> 01:02:39,711
I have another job, so I'll leave you now.

658
01:02:41,196 --> 01:02:43,071
Why don't you take it a little easier?

659
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:45,703
I have to go back to Singapore again.

660
01:02:46,016 --> 01:02:49,235
I wonder if you will come visit her again while I'm gone.

661
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:53,477
Excuse me.

662
01:02:54,766 --> 01:02:56,204
Thank you very much.

663
01:02:57,243 --> 01:02:58,876
Send them.

664
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:05,773
I'm sorry for interrupting.

665
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:23,187
I'm the first to know you've been to Matsushima.

666
01:03:24,913 --> 01:03:26,288
Of course you're not alone.

667
01:03:26,421 --> 01:03:28,718
Natsui..

668
01:03:34,184 --> 01:03:35,825
He's childish.

669
01:03:37,434 --> 01:03:39,645
You didn't need to tell him.

670
01:03:39,997 --> 01:03:43,622
About Matsushima?
There's nothing for him to worry about.

671
01:03:44,466 --> 01:03:46,091
Or is there something wrong?

672
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,528
I heard Natsui's wife ran away.

673
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:56,747
She's not gonna like him.

674
01:03:58,567 --> 01:04:00,614
How did you know about that?

675
01:04:01,106 --> 01:04:03,325
Someone very curious.
He looked it up for me.

676
01:04:04,161 --> 01:04:08,848
The matchmaker for Mr. Natsui is a friend of yours and a friend of yours.

677
01:04:09,223 --> 01:04:10,864
You've gone to a lot of trouble, haven't you?

678
01:04:12,887 --> 01:04:16,395
You shouldn't meddle too much.

679
01:04:20,253 --> 01:04:23,448
I'm going back to the hotel.
I'd like an inventory of our property.

680
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:14,480
Senpai.

681
01:05:14,620 --> 01:05:15,714
You look busy.

682
01:05:16,464 --> 01:05:18,878
It's always like  a war.
Do you go home?

683
01:05:19,573 --> 01:05:20,667
I'm meeting someone at 7:00.

684
01:05:21,237 --> 01:05:26,464
Since you still have time, there's a restaurant in Shinbashi that I know.
Please take a peek at a restaurant for us commoners once in a while.

685
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:28,948
I'll buy you a drink.

686
01:05:29,502 --> 01:05:33,503
Right now, what I'm covering is a move by the Metropolitan Police Department's Investigation Division Two.

687
01:05:34,026 --> 01:05:35,894
So the culprit is an intelligent criminal.

688
01:05:37,003 --> 01:05:40,612
But they've been in secret communication with the Crime Prevention Unit.

689
01:05:41,831 --> 01:05:42,901
with the Crime Prevention Unit?

690
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:47,440
That, apparently, smells a little like a big case.

691
01:05:48,308 --> 01:05:50,839
I think that's smuggling.

692
01:05:51,089 --> 01:05:52,050
You think so too?

693
01:05:53,386 --> 01:05:54,378
You're my senior.

694
01:05:54,403 --> 01:05:57,722
I followed many cases 10 years ago.

695
01:05:58,097 --> 01:05:59,550
Hey New face.

696
01:06:00,284 --> 01:06:02,175
How's it going?

697
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:09,878
She's a nice girl.
She came alone and asked for a job.

698
01:06:11,034 --> 01:06:13,628
Girls these days are brave, even amateurs.

699
01:06:14,206 --> 01:06:16,644
I'd better get going.

700
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:23,425
Ryuzaki 416, please.

701
01:06:34,631 --> 01:06:35,545
Thanks.

702
01:06:38,451 --> 01:06:41,678
Did he go to the hotel with the inventory of your property?

703
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:46,435
I don't know what he's going to do.
My mother's worried.

704
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:52,389
We'll have to wait and see.

705
01:06:54,935 --> 01:06:57,076
Is that what you're talking about?

706
01:07:00,373 --> 01:07:05,732
About Natsui,
She's Chikako.

707
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:14,221
Is this his wife?

708
01:07:14,666 --> 01:07:17,471
She used to be a typist at the same company as Ryuzaki.

709
01:07:21,939 --> 01:07:22,885
He dumped her?

710
01:07:23,939 --> 01:07:28,119
Ryuzaki thinks he's done with everything once he's gone to Singapore.

711
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,400
He doesn't mind that much.

712
01:07:32,814 --> 01:07:37,799
Did you think you could save her by having her marry Mr. Natsui?

713
01:07:41,502 --> 01:07:45,963
Before I came here today, I was invited by a young man at work to a bar in Shinbashi.

714
01:07:47,674 --> 01:07:49,056
She works there.

715
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:56,650
I heard her calling Ryuzaki.
I was wondering what kind of woman she was.

716
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,275
I thought Mr. Natsui would make Ms. Chikako happy.

717
01:08:02,783 --> 01:08:04,486
I really thought.

718
01:08:05,885 --> 01:08:11,361
I heard from Ryuzaki today that they have separated.

719
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:19,744
Chikako-san visited him at the hotel too.

720
01:08:21,088 --> 01:08:21,767
hotel?

721
01:08:22,392 --> 01:08:24,986
I've done a terrible thing.

722
01:08:29,221 --> 01:08:34,080
What is he going to do if he finds out about Ryuzaki and Chikako's relationship?

723
01:08:45,171 --> 01:08:49,179
I thought that once she was married, she could put the past behind her.

724
01:08:50,796 --> 01:08:56,765
I can't believe that Ryuzaki is still in such a strong form in Chikako-san's heart.

725
01:08:58,897 --> 01:09:08,437
Did you not think about how long and how hard it takes for a human being to forget a single love?

726
01:09:10,983 --> 01:09:12,101
Natsui and Chikako

727
01:09:12,265 --> 01:09:13,085
I'm sorry.

728
01:09:14,937 --> 01:09:20,726
The power went out.
Please wait.

729
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:34,559
Were you burdened by Natsui-kun?

730
01:09:37,517 --> 01:09:40,501
You were the ideal man for Natsui-kun.

731
01:09:42,822 --> 01:09:45,902
If you'd asked him to marry someone,He would have... even if he didn't want to.

732
01:09:46,290 --> 01:09:47,724
Don't talk about it.

733
01:09:49,409 --> 01:09:51,370
Everything is my fault.

734
01:10:02,921 --> 01:10:05,621
I don't have the right to blame you.

735
01:10:07,333 --> 01:10:13,713
I didn't realize the pain
I'm the pathetic one.

736
01:10:20,969 --> 01:10:23,843
You can't work in a bar.

737
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:26,886
I can't have a regular job now.

738
01:10:27,639 --> 01:10:29,686
What's so good about Ryuzaki?

739
01:10:30,647 --> 01:10:32,513
Don't tell me what's good or bad.

740
01:10:33,046 --> 01:10:36,819
Picking him up at Haneda is like exposing a woman's weakness.

741
01:10:37,519 --> 01:10:38,859
I don't have a choice.

742
01:10:39,991 --> 01:10:43,204
If I hear he's back, I'd like to see him.

743
01:10:43,854 --> 01:10:46,367
He dumped you.
But you still want to see him?

744
01:10:47,537 --> 01:10:54,157
I'm afraid that if I don't do anything, I'll be stuck with Ryuzaki for the rest of my life.

745
01:10:54,525 --> 01:10:55,478
Stay strong.

746
01:10:56,138 --> 01:10:58,031
You're Natsui's wife now.

747
01:10:58,946 --> 01:11:01,226
He does not love me.

748
01:11:04,898 --> 01:11:13,526
If Natsui had told me he loved me even once...
I wouldn't have gone to see Ryuzaki.

749
01:11:18,835 --> 01:11:23,955
If Ryuzaki really loved you, he would have left his Wife.

750
01:11:25,973 --> 01:11:27,019
It's not fair.

751
01:11:28,286 --> 01:11:30,819
I'm going to see him.

752
01:11:31,639 --> 01:11:32,812
You shouldn't.

753
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:35,624
I need to know exactly what he's really thinking.

754
01:11:36,361 --> 01:11:38,061
And then I'll decide what I want to do.

755
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:40,872
You shouldn't.

756
01:11:42,568 --> 01:11:43,995
You'll only get hurt.

757
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:50,889
I don't think I deserve to be beaten up after what I've done.

758
01:11:52,495 --> 01:11:53,582
I'm only human.

759
01:11:54,021 --> 01:11:56,235
I'd like to live my life defending myself as much as possible.

760
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:03,986
But just being afraid of me getting hurt
I'll never be happy.

761
01:12:07,361 --> 01:12:08,061
Right?

762
01:12:08,580 --> 01:12:09,514
Yeah.

763
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,580
I can't live like this.

764
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:16,830
I don't care how much it hurts, I just want to be loved.

765
01:12:17,812 --> 01:12:19,085
I love him.

766
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:25,594
I'm stumped.
Just say no.

767
01:12:26,043 --> 01:12:27,456
I bet he doesn't show up here either.

768
01:12:28,028 --> 01:12:33,022
Mr. Seimiya of Infinite Japan magazine was angry too.
They won't even ask him to do portraits for every issue anymore.

769
01:12:34,587 --> 01:12:37,821
I didn't think he'd want his wife to run away from him and ruin his work too.

770
01:12:48,837 --> 01:12:50,483
Let's dance.

771
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,903
Let's dance with me.

772
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:56,290
Go ahead.

773
01:12:59,033 --> 01:13:01,980
What a professional photographer could get away with if he'd just missed a portrait.

774
01:13:03,188 --> 01:13:06,655
You have a reputation for being arrogant these days.

775
01:13:07,623 --> 01:13:09,590
That kind of smugness has no place in this society.

776
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,375
You're only as good as the trust you're given.

777
01:13:13,643 --> 01:13:16,943
I don't care if you don't have a job, just leave me alone.

778
01:13:17,584 --> 01:13:22,564
You've changed.
You're not the same person you used to be when you were going around like a work fiend.

779
01:13:44,152 --> 01:13:45,946
How did you remember this place?

780
01:13:47,486 --> 01:13:48,519
I'll take care of it.

781
01:13:49,411 --> 01:13:50,278
Same one.

782
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:52,971
How much do I owe you?

783
01:13:53,098 --> 01:13:54,524
You don't have to pay now.

784
01:13:55,719 --> 01:13:57,073
I've got some money.

785
01:13:57,827 --> 01:13:59,580
It's been a while, so I thought I'd settle up.

786
01:13:59,682 --> 01:14:02,649
Don't worry.
I haven't even kept the books in order.

787
01:14:04,763 --> 01:14:05,996
I'd settle up.

788
01:14:07,516 --> 01:14:10,296
What do you mean?

789
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:13,526
About you too.

790
01:14:16,728 --> 01:14:18,555
I hope you are joking.

791
01:14:19,221 --> 01:14:20,627
I'm serious.

792
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:29,383
I knew you'd say something like that someday.

793
01:14:31,287 --> 01:14:32,567
Something's wrong.

794
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:46,029
Kuse.

795
01:14:46,722 --> 01:14:48,355
It's been a while.

796
01:14:51,242 --> 01:14:54,089
It's serious, isn't it?
Did you get in a fight?

797
01:14:54,689 --> 01:14:57,189
Don't make Madam cry too much.

798
01:14:59,390 --> 01:15:03,050
Madam,
Let's have a drink together to make up.

799
01:15:03,905 --> 01:15:05,232
Let's drink.

800
01:15:05,698 --> 01:15:07,045
Don't worry.

801
01:15:07,551 --> 01:15:10,318
I'm sorry, but...
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

802
01:15:11,192 --> 01:15:12,039
I'm sorry.

803
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:15,778
Send me the bill later.

804
01:15:32,733 --> 01:15:35,253
Hey, what are you doing?

805
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,785
Is it true you're not working at all?

806
01:15:38,045 --> 01:15:38,971
It's true.

807
01:15:38,996 --> 01:15:41,382
You're an idiot, you know that?
What are you doing here all alone?

808
01:15:41,946 --> 01:15:44,359
I'm just disappointed.

809
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:45,865
You mean Mrs. Ryuzaki?

810
01:15:48,377 --> 01:15:50,571
I know you loved her.

811
01:15:52,225 --> 01:15:54,318
Is Mrs. Ryuzaki the reason you separated?

812
01:15:54,698 --> 01:15:56,318
Talking about Chikako is useless.

813
01:15:57,303 --> 01:15:58,936
We couldn't make out.

814
01:15:58,961 --> 01:15:59,710
She's nice.

815
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:03,502
Don't talk about Chikako and Ayako anymore.

816
01:16:11,308 --> 01:16:12,341
Naoki!

817
01:16:12,454 --> 01:16:13,501
What's up?

818
01:16:14,062 --> 01:16:16,062
Kuse left me.

819
01:16:16,586 --> 01:16:18,786
He sees someone.

820
01:16:19,060 --> 01:16:21,074
I know it's a rumor anyway.

821
01:16:21,504 --> 01:16:23,771
Don't get any ideas.
Those two are nothing.

822
01:16:24,752 --> 01:16:26,958
You know about it.

823
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:27,858
About what?

824
01:16:28,485 --> 01:16:32,778
If you don't tell us, I'll come after you.

825
01:16:33,993 --> 01:16:36,020
it's a just rumor

826
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:38,083
Tell me.

827
01:16:38,981 --> 01:16:42,241
I'm just trying to come to terms with my feelings.

828
01:16:42,266 --> 01:16:45,182
Ok then I tell you.

829
01:16:46,066 --> 01:16:47,626
I'm the wife of the branch manager of Meiwa Bussan.

830
01:16:47,932 --> 01:16:48,566
Her name?

831
01:16:49,326 --> 01:16:50,506
Mrs. Ryuzki.

832
01:16:51,278 --> 01:16:52,831
She's beautiful.

833
01:17:08,104 --> 01:17:09,478
Are you alright?

834
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:22,653
This is Kuse.

835
01:17:27,941 --> 01:17:31,681
Did you know that your husband was having an affair outside the home?

836
01:17:33,786 --> 01:17:38,339
No, ma'am.
She's not a whore like us.

837
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,480
she's a wife.

838
01:17:42,039 --> 01:17:44,399
The wife of the branch manager of Meiwa Bussan.

839
01:17:46,027 --> 01:17:46,800
Her name?

840
01:17:47,253 --> 01:17:48,207
Ayako Ryuzki.

841
01:17:49,057 --> 01:17:49,997
Do you know?

842
01:17:50,821 --> 01:17:52,321
Ayako Ryuzki?

843
01:17:52,558 --> 01:17:54,778
She's beautiful.

844
01:18:02,923 --> 01:18:04,110
I'm Ryuzaki.

845
01:18:05,516 --> 01:18:06,756
this is Kuze.

846
01:18:07,852 --> 01:18:11,192
I'm sure you must have been surprised to hear from me so suddenly.

847
01:18:11,856 --> 01:18:12,889
Have a seat.

848
01:18:15,245 --> 01:18:20,472
I'm surprised.
You said the story seems to be related to my wife somehow.

849
01:18:21,974 --> 01:18:25,327
Did your wife ever mention the name Kuse to you?

850
01:18:26,387 --> 01:18:30,487
I was in Singapore for about a year.

851
01:18:31,593 --> 01:18:32,933
Then let me ask you frankly.

852
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:38,473
You never heard about the relationship between your wife and my husband?

853
01:18:41,367 --> 01:18:42,040
What?

854
01:18:52,673 --> 01:18:54,026
This is Natsui.

855
01:18:54,311 --> 01:18:56,438
This is Ryuzaki.

856
01:18:57,283 --> 01:18:59,843
I'm sorry to bother you, but I need to see you right now.

857
01:19:00,038 --> 01:19:02,398
I just need an hour of your time.

858
01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:05,195
Please come to the grill at the Prince Hotel.

859
01:19:10,169 --> 01:19:13,615
By the way, Mr. Natsui, do you know a man named Kuse?

860
01:19:14,032 --> 01:19:15,112
Yes.

861
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:29,748
Actually, the reason I asked you to come here today is because I would be very grateful if you could tell me how well you and my wife are acquainted with Kuse.

862
01:19:30,591 --> 01:19:34,031
I don't know much about them, but I think they are just acquaintances.

863
01:19:34,706 --> 01:19:40,692
I've heard rumors that someone named Kuse has seduced my wife.

864
01:19:41,116 --> 01:19:42,303
That would never happen.

865
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:43,869
It's unthinkable.

866
01:19:44,342 --> 01:19:46,329
Aside from my wife.

867
01:19:46,654 --> 01:19:54,275
For someone like Mr. Kuse, who is doing such a socially respectable job, it's a pity to just start rumors.

868
01:19:54,908 --> 01:19:56,708
That's slander.

869
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:57,805
Who said that?

870
01:19:58,658 --> 01:20:03,578
The madam at the bar who Kuse had left her informed Kuse's wife.

871
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:07,079
No.
She and Kuse are clean.

872
01:20:08,384 --> 01:20:12,051
Thank you for your opinion, and I'm relieved to hear it.

873
01:20:13,780 --> 01:20:18,260
There are people in this world who make all kinds of rumors about other people's wives, you know.

874
01:20:20,283 --> 01:20:21,296
Have a meal.

875
01:20:24,513 --> 01:20:28,146
I don't think that would happen to your wife, Mr. Natsui.

876
01:20:31,336 --> 01:20:32,769
You mean my wife?

877
01:20:34,076 --> 01:20:35,956
Of course, there is no need for you to worry.

878
01:20:37,186 --> 01:20:40,792
I heard that your wife left you.

879
01:20:53,092 --> 01:20:55,812
Why are you telling me this?

880
01:20:57,124 --> 01:20:59,124
I'm puzzled by the rumors about my wife.

881
01:20:59,723 --> 01:21:02,783
I was concerned about you in your senior capacity.

882
01:21:03,924 --> 01:21:05,144
Don't worry about me.

883
01:21:08,593 --> 01:21:13,266
I don't think you have the right to imagine anything strange or dirty about Kuse or your wife.

884
01:21:14,310 --> 01:21:15,957
I am Ayako's husband.

885
01:21:16,267 --> 01:21:21,107
How much Ayako has suffered because of you.
You have had various adulterous relationships since you were in Japan.

886
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:24,877
Do you have the right to accuse Ayako-san as her husband?

887
01:21:25,334 --> 01:21:27,154
Young people these days don't know how to be polite.

888
01:21:27,294 --> 01:21:28,454
That's you!

889
01:21:31,478 --> 01:21:36,391
Natsui.
Before you talk about others, look at yourself a little.

890
01:21:37,325 --> 01:21:41,318
How about it?
Why don't you reflect on why you're hated by your wife?

891
01:21:44,094 --> 01:21:49,108
You guys think I don't know anything.
I'm a more careful man than you might think.

892
01:21:50,135 --> 01:21:53,295
You just made a strong argument that my wife and Kuse are nothing.

893
01:21:54,266 --> 01:21:55,952
You're protecting Kuse, aren't you?

894
01:21:57,071 --> 01:21:59,458
I know everyone.
It's not just about my wife.

895
01:22:00,168 --> 01:22:02,228
I know Chikako left you, and I don't know where she is.

896
01:22:03,495 --> 01:22:04,368
Chikako?

897
01:22:06,418 --> 01:22:08,378
Sorry, your wife

898
01:22:10,645 --> 01:22:15,485
Instead of messing with married women, get a hold of your own wife.

899
01:22:16,150 --> 01:22:18,177
That's why she's running away.

900
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,611
Wait,Natsui!

901
01:22:52,832 --> 01:22:53,699
Welcome back.

902
01:22:54,913 --> 01:22:56,226
You're still awake.

903
01:22:56,652 --> 01:22:57,939
I need to talk to you.

904
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:02,876
Do you know the madam of the bar Clarendon?

905
01:23:03,676 --> 01:23:04,622
Yes, I do.

906
01:23:05,398 --> 01:23:07,772
Michi Yamaoka called me.

907
01:23:09,571 --> 01:23:13,404
She told me about your relationship with Ayako Ryuzaki.

908
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:14,990
What?

909
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:22,034
Since I don't see you anymore, we're married in name only.

910
01:23:23,188 --> 01:23:29,195
So I don't care a bit whether you have a cabaret girl or a bar madam for a lover.

911
01:23:31,112 --> 01:23:32,552
I've given up on that.

912
01:23:34,924 --> 01:23:38,904
But when I heard you had such a relationship with another man's wife, I couldn't stand it.

913
01:23:39,228 --> 01:23:39,728
What?

914
01:23:40,750 --> 01:23:41,736
We are..

915
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:43,650
You guys are?

916
01:23:46,751 --> 01:23:52,696
It is true that Ayako and I are in a relationship.
But it's not the kind of relationship you're imagining.

917
01:23:53,368 --> 01:23:54,521
You're despicable.

918
01:23:55,374 --> 01:23:56,561
She's dirty too.

919
01:23:56,794 --> 01:23:58,901
No, you've got it all wrong.

920
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:02,375
I've met Mr. Ryuzaki.

921
01:24:03,865 --> 01:24:06,505
I'll ask him to look into Ayako

922
01:24:07,891 --> 01:24:08,498
You...

923
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:34,970
You are here.

924
01:24:35,743 --> 01:24:36,997
I've been looking for you.

925
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:38,196
What do you want?

926
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,673
You can't talk to me if you're trying to be decent.

927
01:24:41,308 --> 01:24:44,408
I'm just trying to show you something.
Read this.

928
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,725
I'm not working. I'm not reading this.

929
01:24:47,431 --> 01:24:50,204
Here's a review of your work from Mr. Kuwana.
I'll read the last word.

930
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:56,038
Anyway, what's the reason I haven't come in contact with Natsui's works lately?

931
01:24:56,701 --> 01:25:02,735
I will truly miss Natsui's work.

932
01:25:03,351 --> 01:25:06,664
I greatly admired his experimental ambition and unique techniques.

933
01:25:06,689 --> 01:25:07,464
Stop.

934
01:25:09,434 --> 01:25:11,054
There are people waiting for your work.

935
01:25:11,915 --> 01:25:12,509
You have to work.

936
01:25:13,533 --> 01:25:14,906
I'm sure your wife cares about you.

937
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:17,654
She's a woman who is into my business.

938
01:25:18,051 --> 01:25:19,065
I don't think so.

939
01:25:20,653 --> 01:25:23,613
Even during the exhibition, she came to see it three times, hiding.

940
01:25:24,713 --> 01:25:25,293
Chikako?

941
01:25:27,559 --> 01:25:28,686
The first time I showed her around.

942
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:31,672
Then people deliberately pretended they didn't know her.

943
01:25:32,995 --> 01:25:36,615
She saw how many people were in front of your work, and she looked happy from a distance.

944
01:25:38,587 --> 01:25:41,007
How can you do a good job if you can't even make a home?

945
01:26:38,739 --> 01:26:41,246
This way, I know everything about you.

946
01:26:42,131 --> 01:26:44,171
You're a lot richer than you were two years ago.

947
01:26:45,819 --> 01:26:48,359
Let's make love again like we used to.

948
01:26:50,327 --> 01:26:53,314
Old love?
It's not true.

949
01:26:54,624 --> 01:26:55,430
What's the matter with you?

950
01:26:56,787 --> 01:26:58,020
You once said...

951
01:26:59,166 --> 01:27:01,800
You told me you loved me and that we should be together.

952
01:27:03,723 --> 01:27:07,189
But And when you left for Singapore, you said, "This is what love looks like, forget about it.

953
01:27:07,829 --> 01:27:09,189
I didn't have a choice.

954
01:27:09,748 --> 01:27:12,728
I don't want to.
I don't want that kind of selfish love.

955
01:27:14,378 --> 01:27:18,204
We are an adult.
We need to make love with our bodies.

956
01:27:21,008 --> 01:27:21,688
I'm going home.

957
01:27:22,501 --> 01:27:23,281
I won't let you go.

958
01:27:24,321 --> 01:27:28,287
You came to the airport, you came to the hotel, you came here voluntarily.
You came here of your own volition.

959
01:27:31,093 --> 01:27:37,720
I thought that if you were willing to drop everything and truly love me...
I'd be willing to leave Natsui.

960
01:27:39,263 --> 01:27:41,083
You don't exaggerate like that.

961
01:27:41,739 --> 01:27:46,199
I'm not going to put my future on the line for a woman who became someone else's wife.

962
01:27:54,332 --> 01:27:55,612
I was such a fool.

963
01:27:56,969 --> 01:27:59,469
Your heart is so pathetic.

964
01:28:01,689 --> 01:28:05,304
I'm ashamed to think I'm willing to throw away my life for someone like this.

965
01:28:24,306 --> 01:28:27,972
I had this thing that I was willing to die for.

966
01:28:30,799 --> 01:28:32,659
This is a scissors with which Natsui cuts the film.

967
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:35,919
What are you doing?
Don't be stupid.

968
01:28:57,123 --> 01:28:58,323
You must be Shigetaka Ryuzaki.

969
01:29:00,731 --> 01:29:02,625
We are from police.

970
01:29:04,448 --> 01:29:06,541
This is a warrant for your arrest.
Please come with us.

971
01:29:22,230 --> 01:29:23,103
Something happened?

972
01:29:24,677 --> 01:29:27,590
Ayako-san's voice is very different from usual.

973
01:29:28,016 --> 01:29:32,423
I'll see you and talk about it at usual place.

974
01:29:45,214 --> 01:29:45,874
What's wrong?

975
01:29:45,981 --> 01:29:47,448
Let's go to Kawaji Onsen.

976
01:29:48,468 --> 01:29:50,488
I'm sorry, I decided on my own.

977
01:30:44,594 --> 01:30:45,414
Kuse.

978
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:52,991
Consider me your wife tonight.

979
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:55,460
Please.

980
01:30:57,859 --> 01:30:58,739
Yes.

981
01:31:01,534 --> 01:31:05,314
I couldn't be yours at Matsushima.

982
01:31:06,679 --> 01:31:08,166
It was all right then.

983
01:31:09,602 --> 01:31:11,549
There were things I couldn't have in you, too.

984
01:31:12,620 --> 01:31:14,067
Not tonight.

985
01:31:17,515 --> 01:31:23,161
Tonight, I am your wife.

986
01:31:26,790 --> 01:31:28,590
I want to think that forever.

987
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:32,213
I don't know what the future holds, but for now, it's enough.

988
01:31:33,233 --> 01:31:34,533
Why do you say that?

989
01:31:36,927 --> 01:31:40,807
If this moment lasts, it's like eternity.

990
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,277
What if it doesn't?

991
01:31:46,220 --> 01:31:48,027
Don't think about that.

992
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:53,870
Think of me as your wife for tonight.

993
01:31:54,609 --> 01:31:55,689
Why do you say that?

994
01:31:56,975 --> 01:32:03,235
I'll never let you go.
You're my wife forever.

995
01:32:18,384 --> 01:32:21,204
Talk to us.
Let's me hear it.

996
01:32:23,425 --> 01:32:25,125
I'm afraid to tell you.

997
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:28,803
I want to hold off as long as I can

998
01:32:30,276 --> 01:32:31,223
Please.

999
01:32:48,970 --> 01:32:50,857
Until this fire is extinguished.

1000
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:08,226
Ryuzaki was arrested.

1001
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:08,687
Eh?

1002
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:12,435
Ryuzaki was arrested.

1003
01:33:14,295 --> 01:33:16,149
He's being held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

1004
01:33:17,521 --> 01:33:18,595
What's going on?

1005
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:25,220
He was working with Japanese smugglers in Singapore.

1006
01:33:26,279 --> 01:33:27,359
Is that true?

1007
01:33:29,404 --> 01:33:35,084
A member of the group was arrested, and the police found out about Ryuzaki.

1008
01:33:43,413 --> 01:33:50,080
Ayako.
You're going to confess it tonight and leave me.

1009
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:55,097
Right?
You're going to leave me.

1010
01:34:28,504 --> 01:34:34,523
You can't get a divorce now that Ryuzaki's been arrested.

1011
01:34:36,908 --> 01:34:39,301
Not because I love Ryuzaki.

1012
01:34:40,669 --> 01:34:50,636
I was going to make you my wife this time, no matter what I had to do, no matter how long it took.

1013
01:34:52,536 --> 01:34:54,156
You can't.

1014
01:34:55,599 --> 01:35:04,055
Seeing my mother when the house was raided made it impossible for me to abandon the Ryuzaki family.

1015
01:35:08,895 --> 01:35:11,229
You should have left him earlier.

1016
01:35:16,093 --> 01:35:18,053
What are you going to do now?

1017
01:35:22,969 --> 01:35:27,489
I'm going to stay with the Ryuzaki family.

1018
01:35:27,959 --> 01:35:32,205
So you won't think of me?

1019
01:35:33,819 --> 01:35:36,986
I won't let you go.

1020
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:13,524
Good morning.

1021
01:36:14,219 --> 01:36:16,206
Your wife left on an urgent errand.

1022
01:36:18,091 --> 01:36:20,045
She just left.

1023
01:36:44,601 --> 01:36:45,561
I need a car right away.

1024
01:36:45,861 --> 01:36:47,855
Your wife gave me this.

1025
01:36:51,057 --> 01:36:55,404
I am so sorry.
Please forgive my selfishness.

1026
01:36:56,407 --> 01:37:00,113
I said I would stay in Ryuzaki for my mother's sake.

1027
01:37:00,275 --> 01:37:03,408
I'm sure you must feel very sorry for her.

1028
01:37:05,373 --> 01:37:08,006
But that is not why I am leaving you.

1029
01:37:09,465 --> 01:37:21,889
The more I love you, the more a heavy sense of guilt about Natsui and Chikako spreads in my heart.

1030
01:37:23,114 --> 01:37:25,888
Please forget about Ayako.

1031
01:37:27,015 --> 01:37:30,849
I will not see you again. I will bear it and say goodbye.

1032
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:45,993
Hello?

1033
01:37:46,228 --> 01:37:48,195
Your car is ready.

1034
01:37:50,803 --> 01:37:51,769
I don't need the car anymore.

1035
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,287
Sado?

1036
01:38:39,382 --> 01:38:41,322
I'd like to work for the Bureau of Communications.

1037
01:38:44,338 --> 01:38:46,044
You don't have to go there.

1038
01:38:46,646 --> 01:38:47,952
It's country side.

1039
01:38:49,365 --> 01:38:51,205
I'd like to work there.

1040
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:53,169
For how long?

1041
01:38:53,442 --> 01:38:54,716
Natsui is here.

1042
01:38:54,906 --> 01:38:55,839
I'll be there soon.

1043
01:38:56,057 --> 01:38:58,284
Six months or a year?

1044
01:38:58,436 --> 01:39:00,410
Until retirement.

1045
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,160
What's the hell?

1046
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:06,990
I'm so glad you came.
I was afraid you wouldn't come even if I asked you to.

1047
01:39:07,502 --> 01:39:10,422
I have no face to show to Kuse or Ayako

1048
01:39:10,864 --> 01:39:13,270
No, that's what we're saying.

1049
01:39:15,618 --> 01:39:18,591
Please forgive Ayako's mistake.

1050
01:39:20,889 --> 01:39:24,363
She's already been punished a lot for that kind of thing.

1051
01:39:26,566 --> 01:39:31,626
Ayako has a childish, childish old-fashioned streak in her.

1052
01:39:34,934 --> 01:39:38,121
She thought that you and Chikako would be happy together.

1053
01:39:39,176 --> 01:39:43,069
I should have been more pleased with Ayako and Kuse.

1054
01:39:43,316 --> 01:39:48,676
That's impossible.
I don't need that bullshit blessing.

1055
01:39:50,808 --> 01:39:53,688
You had no choice until now.

1056
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:06,933
Ryuzaki has been arrested.

1057
01:40:09,812 --> 01:40:11,712
Please make Ayako happy.

1058
01:40:14,348 --> 01:40:15,248
Natsui.

1059
01:40:17,632 --> 01:40:20,212
I may be transferred to Sado in the near future.

1060
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,068
I've separated from my wife.

1061
01:40:27,568 --> 01:40:32,675
I told her I was going to live on Sado Island for the rest of my life, and she said she didn't want to be a part of that kind of island life.

1062
01:40:35,984 --> 01:40:38,717
I doubt we'll ever see Ayako again either.

1063
01:40:40,142 --> 01:40:42,176
At least not while we're young.

1064
01:40:42,855 --> 01:40:44,255
Why would you do that?

1065
01:40:46,323 --> 01:40:49,110
I don't know.

1066
01:40:53,063 --> 01:40:56,097
Maybe it's because I love her

1067
01:40:58,293 --> 01:41:00,559
Maybe it's because she loves me.

1068
01:41:02,436 --> 01:41:04,116
Humans are weird

1069
01:41:06,794 --> 01:41:13,354
Kuse
When I learned about Ryuzaki and Chikako, I fell in love with Chikako all over again.

1070
01:41:15,665 --> 01:41:20,738
Do you laugh?
A man who started loving his wife with such a pathetic love...

1071
01:41:22,958 --> 01:41:24,372
I am sure you will be happy!

1072
01:41:25,444 --> 01:41:28,558
You must do a great job for Chikak!

1073
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:32,128
I'll at least pay attention to the magazines when I'm outside.

1074
01:41:33,547 --> 01:41:34,933
I will do it.

1075
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:37,206
I will do it.

1076
01:42:14,549 --> 01:42:15,202
Chikako?

1077
01:42:18,528 --> 01:42:19,602
Welcome back.

1078
01:42:22,168 --> 01:42:23,341
I'm sorry.

1079
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:28,331
I'm sorry.
I'm bad wife.

1080
01:42:31,825 --> 01:42:37,685
I came back here on my own. Can you leave me here?

1081
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:45,903
I'm sorry.

1082
01:42:46,810 --> 01:42:48,396
I'm not going anywhere.

1083
01:42:53,121 --> 01:42:56,361
Good.
I won't let you go.

1084
01:42:58,403 --> 01:42:59,810
I won't let you go.

1085
01:44:01,533 --> 01:44:07,259
Two months have passed since we parted.
I felt as if I were walking in a dream

1086
01:44:08,649 --> 01:44:11,909
Our mother passed away not long after that.

1087
01:44:13,856 --> 01:44:23,181
Shigetaka's mismanagement has destroyed my mother's zest for life, who had been defending the Ryuzaki family's pride.

1088
01:44:24,620 --> 01:44:31,736
It is thanks to my mother's efforts that Shigetaka and I have decided to divorce.

1089
01:44:32,564 --> 01:44:39,151
Now that I am finally a free woman, I am busy getting my affairs in order.

1090
01:44:41,289 --> 01:44:52,193
I made the decision to come to your side after seeing what happened to Natsui and Chikako.

1091
01:44:53,706 --> 01:44:56,626
I really feel lighter in body and mind.

1092
01:44:58,369 --> 01:45:07,419
Please consider the day I leave for Sado as a new beginning with you, with whom I will no longer be parting.

1093
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:24,286
THE END

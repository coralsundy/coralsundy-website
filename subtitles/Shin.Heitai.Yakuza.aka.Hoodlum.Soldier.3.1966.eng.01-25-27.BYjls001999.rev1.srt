2
00:00:13,726 --> 00:00:18,101
Omiya and I again risked our lives to escape from the army.

3
00:00:18,835 --> 00:00:24,632
New soldier gangster
Hoodlum Soldiers Return (#3)
Hoodlum Soldier Deserts Again

4
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:26,656
They are!

5
00:01:43,317 --> 00:01:43,911
What happened?

6
00:01:44,692 --> 00:01:46,332
Gasoline is gone

7
00:01:49,762 --> 00:01:50,270
Let's go

8
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,044
To where?

9
00:01:51,372 --> 00:01:52,473
Let's go as far as we can go

10
00:02:07,256 --> 00:02:10,678
We are walking the same route all the time

11
00:02:12,483 --> 00:02:16,295
Don't worry.
China is so wide

12
00:02:34,725 --> 00:02:36,100
Hey , they are No 8 army

13
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,318
Damn it

14
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:29,319
That's not a statue

15
00:03:30,538 --> 00:03:31,304
Strange

16
00:04:01,655 --> 00:04:02,397
Japan army?

17
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,421
It will be difficult if you are caught by the Japanese army. Let's run away

18
00:04:15,015 --> 00:04:16,101
Who are you?

19
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:18,795
Are you soldiers?

20
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,710
We are Arita top soldier and another

21
00:04:23,046 --> 00:04:27,741
We went to lookout but got out of the army on the way

22
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:29,077
Which team?

23
00:04:29,647 --> 00:04:31,155
4242 team

24
00:04:31,726 --> 00:04:35,038
What?
They moved to the front this morning

25
00:04:38,085 --> 00:04:38,866
Oh right

26
00:04:39,022 --> 00:04:43,780
What did you say?
You guys went in the opposite direction

27
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,155
Why you dress like that?

28
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,296
China no 8 team attacked us on the way

29
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:51,601
Were you caught by them?

30
00:04:51,897 --> 00:04:52,296
Yes

31
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:53,171
Stupid?

32
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:55,851
Are you really Japan army?

33
00:05:03,632 --> 00:05:04,147
Ah

34
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,562
Who you are?

35
00:05:09,312 --> 00:05:11,843
I'm Omiya first grade solider

36
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,226
You look like a rock

37
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:15,858
It's innate.

38
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:23,624
You guys are like garbage but we take care of you

39
00:05:24,632 --> 00:05:27,421
Join our team

40
00:05:30,296 --> 00:05:31,358
Reply!

41
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:34,272
Thank you very much

42
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:48,929
Chief

43
00:05:49,327 --> 00:05:51,546
We have a connection with the army

44
00:05:51,663 --> 00:05:55,764
One way to escape the Kenpeitai is to join the army.

45
00:05:55,944 --> 00:05:57,874
Can't see the forest for the trees

46
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,437
We have been sneaking into the army for a while

47
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:09,890
This team was a very tough team called Hayabusa

48
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:14,257
We trained hard every day

49
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:19,413
Leaders trained their troops hard every day

50
00:06:19,905 --> 00:06:21,327
Put your head down!

51
00:06:21,812 --> 00:06:24,116
Do you get it?

52
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:25,476
I"m talking to you

53
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,233
What the hell?

54
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,304
Wake up!

55
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:47,999
Wake up, Omiya

56
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:50,015
I know

57
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:52,249
Wake up, Omiya

58
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:55,538
That's ridiculous.
I'm sleeping

59
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,726
I don't want to train

60
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:00,757
I will be Renpeikyu 9 for a while

61
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:02,812
Renpeikyu?

62
00:07:04,413 --> 00:07:05,866
That's good idea

63
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:12,796
Hey guys!
Wake up!

64
00:07:15,624 --> 00:07:16,413
Wake up!

65
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:19,007
What the hell you are?

66
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,007
We're sick

67
00:07:21,163 --> 00:07:22,015
What?

68
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:25,054
I have a stomachache

69
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,233
I may be the cecum

70
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,312
cecum?

71
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:31,062
How about you?

72
00:07:32,858 --> 00:07:33,921
What's wrong?

73
00:07:35,718 --> 00:07:36,663
What's wrong with him?

74
00:07:37,647 --> 00:07:39,163
He got mental illness

75
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:42,663
He's been crazy since last night

76
00:07:46,655 --> 00:07:48,280
Ok.
Take a rest

77
00:07:55,702 --> 00:07:57,116
Good job

78
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,093
Good acting

79
00:08:02,171 --> 00:08:06,116
I miss women and drinking

80
00:08:07,538 --> 00:08:09,077
Here's so bad

81
00:08:11,265 --> 00:08:15,765
Usually we can drink alcohol or stay overnight after training

82
00:08:16,835 --> 00:08:18,429
Here's so bad

83
00:08:21,288 --> 00:08:23,593
It ’s good to watch the training while sleeping.

84
00:08:29,944 --> 00:08:30,757
Hot!

85
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:40,452
Hey guys.
Sit on your knees.

86
00:08:41,593 --> 00:08:42,726
Right now!

87
00:08:47,077 --> 00:08:50,030
You got sick because you didn't train

88
00:08:51,257 --> 00:08:52,765
I'll treat you now

89
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:55,624
It's hard but good effect

90
00:08:57,663 --> 00:08:59,069
Line up!

91
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,694
Hit them one by one

92
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,882
I'll show you first

93
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,710
You are the first

94
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:21,812
Are you ready?

95
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:29,085
You're cheeky

96
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:31,257
Fuck you!

97
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:37,835
You bastard!

98
00:09:38,546 --> 00:09:39,413
Beat him!

99
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,132
Yes!

100
00:09:44,054 --> 00:09:44,921
Next

101
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,991
Next

102
00:09:51,694 --> 00:09:52,577
Next

103
00:09:55,405 --> 00:09:56,226
Get out!

104
00:09:58,179 --> 00:09:58,999
Fuck you!

105
00:10:01,522 --> 00:10:02,428
Damn it

106
00:10:05,413 --> 00:10:06,546
Omiya!

107
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:27,929
You bastard!

108
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:44,778
Fuck you!

109
00:10:49,825 --> 00:10:50,505
Fuck you!

110
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,242
Fuck you!

111
00:11:09,813 --> 00:11:10,727
You bastard!

112
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:11,758
Fuck you!

113
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,719
You bastard!

114
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,829
What's wrong with team 3?

115
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:26,516
All team 3 units are normal

116
00:11:26,657 --> 00:11:28,782
Stupid! Why normal?

117
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:37,094
It's the first time that the entire army has become sick

118
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:43,508
Everyone except me and Omiya can't move

119
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,438
I feel boring

120
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,735
Don't be extravagant.

121
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,133
I'll take a bath

122
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:01,851
We're sick.
Don't get too carried away.

123
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,617
You are the cecum, but I'm just crazy

124
00:12:07,148 --> 00:12:08,257
Right?

125
00:12:09,421 --> 00:12:10,851
I'll take a bath

126
00:12:10,882 --> 00:12:11,843
Omiya

127
00:12:36,906 --> 00:12:37,946
This team?

128
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:38,953
Yes they are

129
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,604
They all attacked the psychotic soldier.

130
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:49,151
Where is the psychotic soldier now?

131
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:51,885
He's taking a bath now

132
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:53,268
He's taking a bath now?

133
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:55,331
His name?

134
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,479
He's Omiya first grade solider

135
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:01,409
He is Kisaburo Omiya?

136
00:13:01,745 --> 00:13:03,213
Yes he is

137
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:06,362
I have a stomachache so I'm going to the bathroom

138
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:07,151
OK

139
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:13,280
He has a mate called Arita

140
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:15,975
He's gone to bathroom now

141
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:18,725
What?

142
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:23,733
Omiya.
There's a problem

143
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:24,530
What's wrong?

144
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,732
Kenpei has come

145
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,967
Oh my god

146
00:13:31,288 --> 00:13:32,373
Don't go back

147
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:33,436
Why?

148
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:39,186
Hurry up,Omiya

149
00:13:51,505 --> 00:13:53,114
He left this

150
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,199
This is his underwear

151
00:13:55,824 --> 00:13:57,034
Is he naked?

152
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,011
Where has they gone to?

153
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,650
Don't catch a cold!

154
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:48,370
Omiya and I took a train to Tianjin

155
00:14:56,874 --> 00:14:58,460
Don't touch!

156
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,913
I'm starving

157
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:07,808
Chief

158
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,472
Don't call me chief

159
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,425
How can I call you?

160
00:15:12,604 --> 00:15:15,300
Well..call me Arita-san

161
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,058
Arita-san?
It seems you are different person

162
00:15:20,724 --> 00:15:22,161
How about Big boss?

163
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:23,849
Big boss?

164
00:15:26,497 --> 00:15:29,388
It seems I got promotion

165
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:31,318
That's fine

166
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,193
What?

167
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:36,060
We need to earn money

168
00:15:36,661 --> 00:15:38,130
I was thinking about it

169
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:39,888
But

170
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:43,747
Do you want to thief?

171
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:45,716
How?

172
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:52,919
From there?

173
00:15:54,865 --> 00:15:56,732
Thief from the army

174
00:15:57,717 --> 00:15:59,068
The army has a lot of supplies

175
00:16:00,310 --> 00:16:02,060
Lots of stuff to steal.

176
00:16:03,357 --> 00:16:05,349
But how can we steel?

177
00:16:07,582 --> 00:16:10,980
Anyway we should go inside

178
00:16:12,144 --> 00:16:14,355
There are guards there

179
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,152
Big boss

180
00:16:29,965 --> 00:16:31,027
Chief

181
00:16:32,426 --> 00:16:33,215
Big boss

182
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:36,191
Let's ask that guard

183
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:37,918
that guard?

184
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:41,637
The guards here are nothing but rogues.

185
00:16:42,988 --> 00:16:43,715
You're right

186
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:46,835
He has no motivation to work

187
00:16:49,117 --> 00:16:50,351
Leave it to me

188
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:02,094
Go away

189
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:06,086
Thank you for your work

190
00:17:07,304 --> 00:17:08,719
Are you Japanese?

191
00:17:09,047 --> 00:17:11,609
We're walking around

192
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:12,773
Whereabouts Japanese are you from?

193
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:14,469
I'm from Osaka

194
00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:17,297
Oh you're from Kansai

195
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,062
I'm Omiya.
He's Arita

196
00:17:21,901 --> 00:17:22,799
I see

197
00:17:23,323 --> 00:17:24,580
I'm Bungo

198
00:17:25,330 --> 00:17:28,354
Bungo?
That's funny name

199
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,674
It can't be helped

200
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:35,502
Could you give me a cigarette?

201
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:36,924
OK

202
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,577
Here

203
00:17:40,678 --> 00:17:42,186
Thank you

204
00:17:47,413 --> 00:17:48,413
Do you have a light?

205
00:17:49,085 --> 00:17:50,702
You demand too much

206
00:17:57,546 --> 00:17:59,437
Do you have any interesting stories?

207
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:01,421
How long do you work ?

208
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:07,890
I have been working for about 4 years and half.
I'm only thinking about women right now

209
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:11,046
Are you still in the first grade after working in the army for four and a half years?

210
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:13,874
I was about to promote

211
00:18:15,523 --> 00:18:18,804
You were hated by the boss

212
00:18:19,421 --> 00:18:21,265
It's none of your business

213
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:26,830
I want to ask you a favor

214
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:29,213
Ask me

215
00:18:30,627 --> 00:18:31,658
The chief officer has come

216
00:18:32,369 --> 00:18:33,799
There's no problem

217
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:36,166
Who are they?

218
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:39,330
We are performers

219
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:40,775
performers?

220
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:44,916
I wanted to show the soldiers our performance

221
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,549
You too?

222
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,252
He plays the shamisen.
But He sold it

223
00:18:52,234 --> 00:18:54,210
He can't do anything

224
00:18:56,195 --> 00:18:57,195
Show me

225
00:18:58,523 --> 00:19:00,914
I will

226
00:19:03,648 --> 00:19:04,390
Ready

227
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,374
Good performance

228
00:19:32,843 --> 00:19:34,414
Ok I'll ask our boss

229
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,562
Follow me

230
00:19:38,883 --> 00:19:39,766
Line up

231
00:19:51,254 --> 00:19:52,254
Hide your pistol

232
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,325
I like the song

233
00:20:12,934 --> 00:20:16,637
Ok.Do their physical examination for the time being

234
00:20:17,028 --> 00:20:17,606
Yes

235
00:20:23,926 --> 00:20:24,504
OK

236
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:29,598
What's this?

237
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,466
You have a big cock

238
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:38,919
There's no problem

239
00:20:39,067 --> 00:20:41,255
OK.
Call solders

240
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:43,622
Let's listen to their song

241
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,211
It tastes good

242
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:57,995
Big boss.
We broke through the first barrier

243
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:00,628
Art will help you

244
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:02,035
Thanks to you

245
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:06,716
But from now is the problem

246
00:21:07,552 --> 00:21:09,192
No worries.
Leave it to me

247
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,130
Let's go

248
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:14,733
Hey

249
00:21:17,921 --> 00:21:18,827
Thanks for your work

250
00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:23,546
Your performance was very good

251
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:25,093
Thank you

252
00:21:25,568 --> 00:21:28,389
The leader loved his song

253
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:30,007
These are the reward

254
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,772
This is good sake

255
00:21:34,254 --> 00:21:38,129
There is a lot of sake, rice and sugar here

256
00:21:40,152 --> 00:21:41,105
This is a treasure trove

257
00:21:41,434 --> 00:21:43,894
So I volunteered to come here.

258
00:21:44,582 --> 00:21:46,316
This is better than being in a unit

259
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:47,621
Which unit?

260
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:49,145
64 unit

261
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:52,168
I don't have to go to war if I'm here

262
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:54,825
It ’s very difficult to be in the unit, is n’t it?

263
00:21:55,121 --> 00:22:02,051
But there are a lot of things that go over my head here.

264
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:03,442
For what?

265
00:22:03,629 --> 00:22:07,903
Boss only think about themselves

266
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:13,364
He wears a high-class cloak even in the summer

267
00:22:13,918 --> 00:22:16,575
He hides supplies under the cloak

268
00:22:16,989 --> 00:22:20,145
He hides supplies and takes them out

269
00:22:20,801 --> 00:22:21,645
Line up!

270
00:22:22,332 --> 00:22:26,364
Some people load them on trucks and carry out supplies.

271
00:22:27,891 --> 00:22:32,930
The bosses make money by selling it to the townspeople

272
00:22:33,508 --> 00:22:39,579
Our bosses are so bad that I hate to obey their orders

273
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:41,524
You think so?

274
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,907
You're right

275
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:49,993
In other words, you don't know if you take out supplies from here.

276
00:22:50,907 --> 00:22:53,008
Yeah, no one know

277
00:22:55,962 --> 00:22:59,891
I say you are not performers

278
00:23:03,532 --> 00:23:04,462
You're solders

279
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:08,047
I know everything

280
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:11,852
I know the soldiers right away

281
00:23:12,704 --> 00:23:14,110
Did you escape from Army?

282
00:23:16,665 --> 00:23:17,352
Kind of

283
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:20,876
What the hell you are doing?

284
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,556
Can I ask you a favor?

285
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:30,970
For what?

286
00:23:32,595 --> 00:23:37,024
I also want to make money

287
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:40,227
We can share the profit

288
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:51,793
I thought I could work with you when you first came

289
00:23:53,262 --> 00:23:54,434
Leave it to me

290
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,510
Who's there!

291
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,088
Oh you.
What's this?

292
00:24:55,557 --> 00:24:57,212
You bastard

293
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,721
What!

294
00:25:01,064 --> 00:25:02,860
You want to go to die?

295
00:25:03,775 --> 00:25:05,361
Or let us go?

296
00:25:05,627 --> 00:25:07,783
If so, I'll give you some profit

297
00:25:08,268 --> 00:25:11,533
Shall we kill him first?

298
00:25:13,096 --> 00:25:15,502
Do you want some profits?

299
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,752
Or you want us to kill you?

300
00:25:18,205 --> 00:25:19,729
Tell me!

301
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,018
Ok I get it.
I'll let you go

302
00:25:24,354 --> 00:25:25,346
You sure?

303
00:25:25,885 --> 00:25:26,893
Yes

304
00:25:31,479 --> 00:25:32,197
Profits

305
00:25:32,525 --> 00:25:33,354
What?

306
00:25:34,088 --> 00:25:35,502
Come get it tomorrow afternoon

307
00:25:37,979 --> 00:25:39,471
You are like a thief

308
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:44,149
Big boss.
Is he OK?

309
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,727
I know he wants profits

310
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:47,953
He's so cheeky

311
00:25:53,766 --> 00:25:56,797
Let's make this the last time we steal.

312
00:25:58,368 --> 00:25:59,930
We can try more

313
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:02,180
That's so risky
Don't get carried away

314
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:06,110
I'll give him this much

315
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:07,797
That's too much

316
00:26:10,272 --> 00:26:12,788
It's better to give some more

317
00:26:14,897 --> 00:26:15,991
OK?

318
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,093
Not only sugar but Let's steel some tobacco

319
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,043
I'm here to get the share

320
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,143
Good. so now we are same criminal

321
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:44,026
Only this?

322
00:26:44,862 --> 00:26:45,518
You're not satisfied?

323
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,073
I want 10 times more

324
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:51,815
You are greedy for money.

325
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:56,721
If they find this, I could be court-martialed.

326
00:26:58,024 --> 00:26:59,204
So I want more

327
00:27:00,454 --> 00:27:01,610
I can't give you anymore

328
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,149
OK

329
00:27:07,946 --> 00:27:11,837
I'll show you what will happen if you don't give me more

330
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,728
OK show me

331
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,532
I've asked my subordinate to come here

332
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,345
I'll arrest you if you obey me

333
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:29,204
Choose you give me more or you are arrested

334
00:27:29,892 --> 00:27:30,978
What the hell?

335
00:27:34,329 --> 00:27:35,603
You can do whatever you want

336
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,673
What did you do?

337
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,009
They are

338
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:57,306
You have stolen valuable military supplies.

339
00:27:58,642 --> 00:27:59,860
I hand you over to the kenpeitai

340
00:28:00,118 --> 00:28:01,118
kenpeitai?

341
00:28:01,845 --> 00:28:02,610
That's ok

342
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,860
What?

343
00:28:04,532 --> 00:28:07,329
I have a lot to talk to them

344
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,492
What?

345
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:15,110
We are not the only ones to divert valuable military supplies

346
00:28:15,775 --> 00:28:17,657
All the people here are habitual offenders.

347
00:28:17,682 --> 00:28:18,400
Shut up!

348
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:20,556
I have the proof

349
00:28:22,314 --> 00:28:26,564
I think you should look into this team

350
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,735
You are bastard!

351
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:42,730
Fuck you!

352
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:48,519
Stop it,Omiya!

353
00:28:49,715 --> 00:28:51,254
Stop it

354
00:28:53,988 --> 00:28:55,894
I'll beat you if you hand me over

355
00:28:57,192 --> 00:28:58,161
Stop it

356
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:59,114
Stop it

357
00:28:59,317 --> 00:29:00,091
Why?

358
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:03,645
Kenpeitai is not here.
They are too far

359
00:29:08,333 --> 00:29:12,325
I'll forget this.
soldiers keep their word.

360
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:14,965
Instead of it,get out from here now

361
00:29:28,542 --> 00:29:29,721
Damn it

362
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,995
Show them how strong the military is.

363
00:29:34,206 --> 00:29:35,135
Get up!

364
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:38,635
Damn it

365
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:49,845
I know what's going on

366
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:57,452
What?

367
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:01,937
You say soldiers keep their word.

368
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:03,116
Wait!

369
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:06,398
I'll make your mouth close

370
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:31,036
See you

371
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:39,130
What's wrong with your pistol?

372
00:30:40,052 --> 00:30:41,021
I have it

373
00:30:43,990 --> 00:30:45,013
Don't worry

374
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:49,786
Let's go for play for the first time in long time

375
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,841
I have money

376
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:54,505
Let's go

377
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,704
Let's go

378
00:31:14,013 --> 00:31:17,061
Omiya!
Stop it!

379
00:31:19,686 --> 00:31:20,983
What's wrong?

380
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:25,279
I want to cry

381
00:31:26,545 --> 00:31:27,412
You can cry

382
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,287
Don't you feel sad?

383
00:31:30,537 --> 00:31:33,029
I feel fun

384
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:36,012
I like to cry

385
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:45,856
None of the people here came to mainland China of their own volition.

386
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,501
We can't go back to Japan

387
00:31:50,985 --> 00:31:56,212
I feel like crying to listen to the Japanese song

388
00:31:57,452 --> 00:32:00,546
Big boss,
You think too much

389
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,593
Let;s make it over

390
00:32:05,192 --> 00:32:06,137
Give me Sake

391
00:32:06,918 --> 00:32:09,348
Wait

392
00:32:10,707 --> 00:32:15,168
You shouldn't drink too much

393
00:32:15,786 --> 00:32:18,575
Lunch is always full.

394
00:32:20,364 --> 00:32:21,864
It's good you earn so much

395
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:23,957
Thanks

396
00:32:24,629 --> 00:32:27,207
Leader is busy today.
Call women right now

397
00:32:27,348 --> 00:32:28,200
Sure

398
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:33,106
You shouldn't drink.
Let's choose our woman

399
00:32:33,762 --> 00:32:34,559
Do whatever you want

400
00:32:35,106 --> 00:32:36,606
Ok I do

401
00:32:40,051 --> 00:32:40,988
Choose me

402
00:32:41,285 --> 00:32:42,309
Ok I'll choose you

403
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:44,792
I've changed my mind

404
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,120
Ok I'll choose you

405
00:32:49,363 --> 00:32:50,495
Excuse me

406
00:32:51,333 --> 00:32:52,247
Come with me

407
00:32:53,731 --> 00:32:54,989
Where are you going to?

408
00:32:56,036 --> 00:32:58,520
I'm sorry.
Please lend her

409
00:32:59,614 --> 00:33:02,036
The leader of Kenpeitai has come

410
00:33:02,387 --> 00:33:03,059
Kenpei?

411
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:05,786
I can't go against them

412
00:33:06,356 --> 00:33:08,684
They are same guest like me

413
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,033
We're very sorry

414
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:15,072
Only for a short time

415
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,041
Instead, invite you to an interesting place

416
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:35,606
Do you like this?

417
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:37,255
Can you do this?

418
00:33:37,606 --> 00:33:39,036
I'm good at gambling

419
00:34:03,032 --> 00:34:04,188
I won!

420
00:34:10,581 --> 00:34:11,308
I bet

421
00:34:22,722 --> 00:34:23,464
Damn it

422
00:34:43,457 --> 00:34:44,285
Omiya

423
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:46,246
What are you going to do?

424
00:34:46,271 --> 00:34:48,137
Shall we help you?

425
00:34:49,004 --> 00:34:50,051
Thanks

426
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:16,342
I'll put this on.

427
00:35:19,959 --> 00:35:20,693
Play it

428
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:33,053
You guys spent last night drinking, a woman and my money

429
00:35:34,409 --> 00:35:37,323
But we have no money now

430
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,315
Are you guys not going to pay?

431
00:35:41,205 --> 00:35:42,260
I don't mean that

432
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:45,948
We'll work and pay you back

433
00:35:45,973 --> 00:35:46,643
What work?

434
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:49,877
We'll do anything

435
00:35:50,651 --> 00:35:54,080
I get it.
The daily allowance is very low

436
00:35:55,104 --> 00:35:55,784
You mean?

437
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:59,284
1 day 0.3 yuan with 3 meals

438
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:02,041
That's ok

439
00:36:03,815 --> 00:36:06,307
How about you?

440
00:36:09,362 --> 00:36:10,385
We have no choice

441
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:16,651
It's better to be in army

442
00:36:29,605 --> 00:36:31,550
What's wrong with you?

443
00:36:32,488 --> 00:36:36,636
After you left and I came to gamble

444
00:36:37,308 --> 00:36:38,355
Then I lost

445
00:36:39,269 --> 00:36:42,222
You are miserable

446
00:36:46,061 --> 00:36:48,084
Have you been working here for a long time?

447
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,490
I have been working here for 4 years

448
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:57,842
I went to Shanghai first then Beijing and Tenjin

449
00:36:58,115 --> 00:36:59,686
But I have been working here longest

450
00:37:02,037 --> 00:37:06,772
I thought I would go back to Japan when I first saved money

451
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:11,131
I have increased my debt and gave up on returning to Japan

452
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:12,920
So I decided to forget about it

453
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:19,327
Yummy

454
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:24,709
How much do you work for?

455
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:25,967
1 day 0.3 yen

456
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:31,194
You're stupid.
You were deceived by him too

457
00:37:32,469 --> 00:37:38,141
He takes people with money to the gambling hall and cheats them.

458
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:41,625
Is it cheating?

459
00:37:41,758 --> 00:37:43,266
It's kind of

460
00:37:43,414 --> 00:37:44,828
Is that true?

461
00:37:45,547 --> 00:37:46,258
Well

462
00:37:46,508 --> 00:37:48,125
What're you doing?
Customers has come

463
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:50,055
See you

464
00:37:50,586 --> 00:37:54,430
Wash more thoroughly.
Still has some stains.

465
00:37:56,617 --> 00:37:59,813
What the hell?

466
00:38:01,227 --> 00:38:03,375
What are you doing?

467
00:38:06,625 --> 00:38:08,196
Does it taste bad?

468
00:38:09,422 --> 00:38:12,875
I didn't expect to eat here

469
00:38:13,469 --> 00:38:16,023
If you are fooled by him, everyone will be like this

470
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:17,586
Remi

471
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:18,305
OK

472
00:38:18,469 --> 00:38:19,383
Thanks

473
00:38:19,408 --> 00:38:20,735
I'll give you mine too

474
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:21,610
Thanks

475
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:23,008
I'll give you half

476
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:23,688
What's wrong?

477
00:38:24,164 --> 00:38:28,344
We skip meals if there are no more than 10 customers a day

478
00:38:29,468 --> 00:38:30,835
He's so greedy for money

479
00:38:31,077 --> 00:38:34,452
You are better than us.
You'll have all meals

480
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:40,674
I can't accept

481
00:38:41,799 --> 00:38:42,861
I feel like being crazy

482
00:38:45,744 --> 00:38:48,822
I want to revenge to him

483
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:50,580
Be careful

484
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:53,471
They have something to do with Kenpeitai

485
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:57,900
All the money taken from you go to the Kenpeitai.

486
00:39:00,014 --> 00:39:02,186
Let's do something

487
00:39:03,866 --> 00:39:06,405
I'm so upset

488
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:10,884
You are very patient

489
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:13,892
We don’t have pistol now

490
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,697
Please forgive me

491
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:28,853
I have an idea.
Would you like to run away together?

492
00:39:30,236 --> 00:39:31,025
Run away?

493
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:33,674
Everyone escapes from here

494
00:39:34,166 --> 00:39:37,689
That's interesting.
What do you think?

495
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:48,826
I can't walk anymore.
Let's take a rest

496
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:51,029
I am walking all night

497
00:40:51,193 --> 00:40:52,709
You have no guts

498
00:40:52,734 --> 00:40:55,748
I have never walked like this

499
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,279
Ok let's take a rest

500
00:41:01,842 --> 00:41:02,974
Don't look

501
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,042
We dissolve here

502
00:41:11,581 --> 00:41:12,660
We dissolve here?

503
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,230
It's enough to get here.
You're free now

504
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:24,222
We have come to rely on you.
What should we do from now on?

505
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:26,159
You are responsible

506
00:41:26,543 --> 00:41:27,668
I can't take responsibility for you

507
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:29,168
What should we do from now on?

508
00:41:29,301 --> 00:41:31,199
I told you you are free

509
00:41:31,683 --> 00:41:33,886
You are responsible

510
00:41:33,911 --> 00:41:37,269
We can't do anything if we break up in this field

511
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,449
That's true

512
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,550
I'll get back

513
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:41,926
Wait.
To where?

514
00:41:42,621 --> 00:41:44,886
I have no choice but back there

515
00:41:44,941 --> 00:41:46,238
You can't

516
00:41:46,761 --> 00:41:48,425
How can I live?

517
00:41:48,769 --> 00:41:52,613
We can't live without prostitution

518
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:55,504
We can only do that

519
00:41:55,529 --> 00:41:57,894
That's right.

520
00:41:58,965 --> 00:42:00,402
Omiya.
What should we do?

521
00:42:03,746 --> 00:42:05,519
Would you like to run a comfort station with them?

522
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:07,308
 comfort station?

523
00:42:07,746 --> 00:42:09,105
For government

524
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:10,722
is that good?

525
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:14,090
If you run, we will do our best to work

526
00:42:14,729 --> 00:42:15,682
I can't!

527
00:42:17,018 --> 00:42:17,635
Why?

528
00:42:18,268 --> 00:42:21,010
I don't want to be the manege

529
00:42:21,174 --> 00:42:24,869
What are you talking about?
Don't pretend you are great

530
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:29,307
You can only do if you want.

531
00:42:30,643 --> 00:42:31,611
Why?

532
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:32,416
I take another action

533
00:42:33,221 --> 00:42:36,471
Just you can help us.

534
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:38,658
you can help us.

535
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,150
Why you don't want?

536
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:43,072
I hate it

537
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:44,838
That's good business

538
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:47,236
Have you ever done that?

539
00:42:47,939 --> 00:42:51,525
I have never done it.
But Working with women seems to be fun

540
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,431
We work hard so don't worry about money

541
00:42:57,346 --> 00:43:01,705
You are good for managers because you are kind to women

542
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:16,291
Big boss

543
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:20,346
Omiya.
Just you do

544
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:22,752
I'll leave

545
00:43:24,548 --> 00:43:25,369
It can't be helped

546
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:36,772
We can't

547
00:43:39,929 --> 00:43:40,991
Everyone go back

548
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:44,296
You said you'll start the business

549
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,499
That's right

550
00:43:47,608 --> 00:43:51,124
Big boss can't do so I can't do

551
00:43:51,663 --> 00:43:54,272
You're so selfish

552
00:43:54,297 --> 00:43:57,061
Big boss can't do so I can't do

553
00:43:57,116 --> 00:43:58,749
I know you want to do

554
00:44:00,538 --> 00:44:03,983
Big boss can't do so I can't do

555
00:44:04,598 --> 00:44:05,864
Everyone go back

556
00:44:05,926 --> 00:44:06,997
I can't

557
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:08,606
Everyone go back

558
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:10,559
Omiya

559
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:22,125
I lost.
Let's do!

560
00:44:26,922 --> 00:44:28,250
What should I do with this?

561
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:39,925
Is  this OK?

562
00:44:40,824 --> 00:44:41,613
Good

563
00:44:43,746 --> 00:44:46,113
I think around here

564
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:48,308
Here!

565
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:54,043
Wait!

566
00:44:55,183 --> 00:44:56,902
Please pay the money first

567
00:44:59,871 --> 00:45:04,074
I didn't know there was a comfort station here

568
00:45:05,871 --> 00:45:06,707
Oh you!

569
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:09,871
Long time no see

570
00:45:09,896 --> 00:45:11,167
How did you know here?

571
00:45:11,192 --> 00:45:14,207
I happened to hear about you.
Here is so good

572
00:45:14,232 --> 00:45:15,832
We've build with the money

573
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:18,285
Please come sometime

574
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:19,980
Let's go

575
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:25,248
Hanako

576
00:45:27,521 --> 00:45:28,435
Thanks for your work

577
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:30,826
Yoshiko

578
00:45:31,123 --> 00:45:31,708
Yes

579
00:45:33,482 --> 00:45:34,615
Thanks for your work

580
00:45:43,646 --> 00:45:44,583
Boss

581
00:45:45,942 --> 00:45:47,419
Leader!

582
00:45:50,464 --> 00:45:52,823
You've opened comfort station here

583
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:56,073
You're thief

584
00:45:56,917 --> 00:45:59,135
Return the stolen item

585
00:46:01,339 --> 00:46:04,401
I was waiting for you

586
00:46:06,151 --> 00:46:09,924
You manage these women in debt

587
00:46:10,385 --> 00:46:14,159
Now they are making a lot of money

588
00:46:15,057 --> 00:46:17,268
It's none of your business

589
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:21,573
You bastard!

590
00:46:23,198 --> 00:46:24,120
Stop it

591
00:46:34,110 --> 00:46:35,267
Break here!

592
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:49,894
Big boss

593
00:46:51,582 --> 00:46:52,644
What's wrong?

594
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:54,870
Ryugu attacked here?

595
00:46:55,347 --> 00:46:56,839
That dude

596
00:46:56,864 --> 00:46:58,292
Wait

597
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:08,074
He says he wants to fight one-on-one with you

598
00:47:09,030 --> 00:47:13,515
They are waiting in the warehouse at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning

599
00:47:13,905 --> 00:47:15,577
I accept it

600
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:17,505
I'll beat them

601
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:19,950
I'm ready for it

602
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:22,536
But they have a pistol

603
00:47:22,684 --> 00:47:24,466
I don't care

604
00:47:25,684 --> 00:47:26,278
Stop it

605
00:47:27,895 --> 00:47:29,372
I can't forgive them

606
00:47:30,802 --> 00:47:31,849
This is my order

607
00:47:34,122 --> 00:47:43,887
But omiya wore a new kimono the next day and went to the promised place

608
00:47:45,442 --> 00:47:49,411
I was worried and followed him

609
00:48:25,524 --> 00:48:27,876
That's not what you promised.

610
00:48:29,415 --> 00:48:31,009
I thought you were alone

611
00:48:31,899 --> 00:48:33,509
Quarrel always changes

612
00:48:35,862 --> 00:48:36,816
Who's this guy?

613
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:39,323
I can't tell

614
00:48:49,035 --> 00:48:49,738
Big boss

615
00:48:50,614 --> 00:48:51,801
You are two too

616
00:48:52,481 --> 00:48:53,207
It has been changed

617
00:48:55,543 --> 00:48:57,481
Ok Let's fight!

618
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,817
I won't die if shot

619
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,824
You bastard

620
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,012
Are you a soldier?

621
00:49:15,816 --> 00:49:17,050
you are a soldier

622
00:49:25,601 --> 00:49:26,515
What are you guys doing?

623
00:49:27,054 --> 00:49:28,031
We do nothing

624
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:30,093
I heard the shot

625
00:49:31,507 --> 00:49:33,702
I just tried it

626
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:36,009
You sure?

627
00:49:36,759 --> 00:49:37,986
Trust me

628
00:49:38,923 --> 00:49:39,462
Yes

629
00:49:42,493 --> 00:49:43,790
Don't fire your pistol for nothing.

630
00:49:50,217 --> 00:49:51,420
That's strange

631
00:49:54,334 --> 00:49:55,935
I wonder if it was such a play

632
00:49:58,544 --> 00:50:04,341
But then they didn't get revenge

633
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:09,357
Women also worked hard and peaceful days continued

634
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:12,927
How about this

635
00:50:15,428 --> 00:50:19,607
All the customers who come here can aim for Momoko

636
00:50:20,756 --> 00:50:22,326
I know she's nice

637
00:50:22,662 --> 00:50:26,935
She's not only beautiful but also plays nice

638
00:50:29,118 --> 00:50:30,720
You guys found a good woman

639
00:50:31,899 --> 00:50:35,056
Momoko is one in 10,000 women

640
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:39,040
She's nice so much?

641
00:50:39,321 --> 00:50:43,892
I have a lot of experience with women

642
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:47,743
It's the first time I've met such a beautiful woman

643
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:50,138
How good is she?

644
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:54,411
You will never be able to forget her.

645
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:58,490
I won

646
00:51:03,873 --> 00:51:04,560
Your turn

647
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:20,889
Momoko is one in 10,000 women

648
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:24,014
Omiya

649
00:51:25,412 --> 00:51:26,162
Eh?

650
00:51:26,951 --> 00:51:29,990
Do you love momoko?

651
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:34,677
Is it bad?

652
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:35,630
It's bad

653
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,411
Why?

654
00:51:38,802 --> 00:51:42,365
Because other women are jealous.

655
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:44,638
We will be unable to manage them

656
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:48,193
If you like women, go to another comfort station

657
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:53,803
If you want to marry her, fine.

658
00:51:53,828 --> 00:51:54,545
marry her?

659
00:51:55,584 --> 00:51:57,013
No way

660
00:51:58,646 --> 00:52:00,092
Then forget about her

661
00:52:01,623 --> 00:52:06,521
You are sometime like school teacher

662
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:14,802
Omiya

663
00:52:16,708 --> 00:52:20,888
All the girls look cute when we live together

664
00:52:21,602 --> 00:52:23,102
We are like family

665
00:52:25,805 --> 00:52:29,289
It saddens me to think of their fate.

666
00:52:31,609 --> 00:52:37,039
Soldiers are enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine if they die

667
00:52:38,273 --> 00:52:42,531
They don't get a grave built for them when they die.

668
00:52:44,526 --> 00:52:48,026
They are used until their bodies become puffy

669
00:52:50,191 --> 00:52:51,480
I feel sorry for them

670
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,956
He's easy to get sleep

671
00:54:11,152 --> 00:54:12,238
What?

672
00:54:12,637 --> 00:54:13,668
What?

673
00:54:16,418 --> 00:54:17,512
What's wrong?

674
00:54:17,996 --> 00:54:20,340
Oh why I'm here?

675
00:54:21,263 --> 00:54:22,590
Don't pretend you don't know

676
00:54:23,287 --> 00:54:25,076
You entered from there

677
00:54:26,193 --> 00:54:28,045
I knew you'd come

678
00:54:29,274 --> 00:54:31,251
I like you

679
00:54:33,712 --> 00:54:34,376
What?

680
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:35,485
Advance payment

681
00:54:36,227 --> 00:54:37,618
It does not need

682
00:54:37,946 --> 00:54:39,626
This is rule

683
00:54:40,087 --> 00:54:42,610
I loved you from the beginning

684
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,501
I know, but give me money

685
00:54:45,547 --> 00:54:47,383
You're mean

686
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:49,946
I don't feel good without money

687
00:54:50,516 --> 00:54:51,938
Go to take the money

688
00:54:55,561 --> 00:54:56,303
You're stupid

689
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,131
I like you too

690
00:55:40,722 --> 00:55:41,441
Great

691
00:55:43,331 --> 00:55:44,206
Oh my god

692
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:46,472
I'm falling in love

693
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:50,863
Good night,Momoko

694
00:55:54,845 --> 00:55:55,548
Good night

695
00:55:57,064 --> 00:55:57,666
Omiya

696
00:56:04,432 --> 00:56:08,628
As big boss says, you should marry

697
00:56:09,198 --> 00:56:12,245
But I can't marry

698
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:18,206
you should marry.
I'm jealous of you but it can't be helped

699
00:56:18,831 --> 00:56:20,612
If you don't get married, we won't have control here.

700
00:56:22,628 --> 00:56:24,315
What do you think,Momoko

701
00:56:25,886 --> 00:56:29,542
I'm a woman, I can marry him.

702
00:56:30,151 --> 00:56:32,628
We don't have to be a couple

703
00:56:32,956 --> 00:56:35,870
If you don't get married I won't see you anymore

704
00:56:36,136 --> 00:56:37,190
You're mean

705
00:56:37,215 --> 00:56:37,792
Omiya

706
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:39,729
You should

707
00:56:41,237 --> 00:56:44,393
How do we get married?

708
00:56:45,065 --> 00:56:46,479
How?

709
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:51,987
Call the pastors and priest and swear to get married in front of them

710
00:56:52,698 --> 00:56:53,362
How should I say?

711
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:56,870
Say Treat her as a wife forever

712
00:56:57,347 --> 00:56:58,175
forever?

713
00:56:59,331 --> 00:57:04,097
It's okay for a month or a year for me

714
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:08,634
There is no such wedding

715
00:57:09,439 --> 00:57:13,767
I have no relationship with pastors or priests

716
00:57:14,395 --> 00:57:21,145
I know a ex Buddhist monk.

717
00:57:21,231 --> 00:57:21,762
Ex Buddhist monk?

718
00:57:21,934 --> 00:57:23,387
Shall I bring him in?

719
00:57:24,153 --> 00:57:25,215
That's good

720
00:57:26,981 --> 00:57:28,434
No way

721
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:34,106
Wedding is not for money

722
00:57:34,770 --> 00:57:35,372
So

723
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:40,371
Anything is fine, so prepare appropriately

724
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:44,043
I still think you should prepare something proper.

725
00:57:44,068 --> 00:57:46,590
You are an annoying person.

726
00:57:46,615 --> 00:57:49,036
Just marry him in a good mood.

727
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,974
I have never prepared a wedding

728
00:57:52,451 --> 00:57:54,646
What kind of sutra should I read?

729
00:57:54,779 --> 00:57:57,333
I have no idea.
Anything is fine

730
00:57:57,513 --> 00:57:58,865
Let's go

731
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,060
But Bun-san

732
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:01,045
Bun-san?

733
00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:04,443
Mr.Bungo,
I have only read funeral sutras.

734
00:58:04,810 --> 00:58:06,881
They never know what you read

735
00:58:06,906 --> 00:58:09,373
that's bad for them.
Wait

736
00:58:11,981 --> 00:58:14,052
So let's get started

737
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:14,981
OK

738
00:58:18,708 --> 00:58:24,372
Then we will start the wedding now

739
00:58:25,614 --> 00:58:30,560
The groom should hold the bride's hand

740
00:58:36,837 --> 00:58:42,181
You make her a wife

741
00:58:42,705 --> 00:58:48,244
Do you swear to love her forever?

742
00:58:49,634 --> 00:58:51,907
I'll do my best

743
00:58:53,751 --> 00:58:58,446
From now on I will read the sutra

744
00:58:58,837 --> 00:59:02,790
In the meantime, have a drink.

745
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,849
It was a very strange wedding

746
00:59:44,599 --> 00:59:50,879
It was a wedding that mixed Buddhism, Shintoism, and Christianity.

747
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:58,208
After they left, Bungo and Big Boss returned to the room with a woman.

748
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:03,435
I suddenly felt lonely for some reason

749
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:09,278
What's wrong?

750
01:00:13,216 --> 01:00:15,067
The wedding is over

751
01:00:15,474 --> 01:00:16,224
Let's drink

752
01:00:16,653 --> 01:00:18,552
Where's your wife?

753
01:00:19,239 --> 01:00:20,551
She's there

754
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:21,888
Did you have quarrel?

755
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,474
No

756
01:00:25,177 --> 01:00:29,700
I don't want you to be alone

757
01:00:30,927 --> 01:00:33,146
So I didn't want to get married

758
01:00:34,513 --> 01:00:36,630
I will always be with you

759
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:37,481
Is that OK?

760
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:39,247
Omiya

761
01:00:41,458 --> 01:00:45,317
You and I are totally different

762
01:00:46,419 --> 01:00:47,997
Sometimes I have the same idea with you

763
01:00:48,536 --> 01:00:52,263
But mostly you and I think differently.

764
01:00:54,434 --> 01:01:00,434
I feel sometime it's better to separate with you

765
01:01:02,942 --> 01:01:06,450
But you already know my mind.

766
01:01:07,950 --> 01:01:16,099
I don't know the detail but I really know how you feel

767
01:01:18,431 --> 01:01:19,376
So you know?

768
01:01:24,384 --> 01:01:25,626
Arita leader

769
01:01:31,181 --> 01:01:33,587
I'll support you forever

770
01:01:39,564 --> 01:01:43,829
Don't pretend you are great

771
01:01:46,110 --> 01:01:47,422
I'm sorry

772
01:01:47,712 --> 01:01:49,790
Let's drink together

773
01:01:57,321 --> 01:01:59,720
You should get wife too

774
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,353
No way.
I feel annoy

775
01:02:05,001 --> 01:02:06,149
You asked me to get marry

776
01:02:06,969 --> 01:02:08,805
Don't complain.

777
01:02:11,275 --> 01:02:12,446
Kenpei has come

778
01:02:13,267 --> 01:02:14,001
Kenpei ?

779
01:02:22,993 --> 01:02:23,954
What Can I do for you?

780
01:02:24,876 --> 01:02:27,306
You are Arita leader and Omiya first grade

781
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:33,759
Are you going to arrest us?

782
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,837
I won't.
I can arrest you anytime

783
01:02:39,868 --> 01:02:40,993
So Why you are here?

784
01:02:41,907 --> 01:02:45,392
I will look into you guys.

785
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:47,946
I know you are runaway soldiers

786
01:02:48,814 --> 01:02:50,454
You'll look into for nothing

787
01:02:51,845 --> 01:02:54,235
I can arrest you anytime

788
01:02:55,525 --> 01:02:56,525
Are you threatening us?

789
01:03:01,595 --> 01:03:03,384
You are making good profits

790
01:03:05,951 --> 01:03:07,576
Let me see inside

791
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,154
I hate him

792
01:03:13,716 --> 01:03:15,185
He's here for something

793
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:17,646
He'll deal with us

794
01:03:19,021 --> 01:03:20,631
We can beat him

795
01:03:21,646 --> 01:03:24,443
He's active kenpei

796
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,318
Was there party?

797
01:03:37,271 --> 01:03:38,669
He got marry

798
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:42,560
Married?
That's good to hear

799
01:03:43,169 --> 01:03:44,138
Who's his wife

800
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:45,818
Momoko

801
01:03:48,646 --> 01:03:52,060
Momoko? the woman was in Ryugu?

802
01:03:54,576 --> 01:03:55,732
Do you know her?

803
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:02,264
I don't like you

804
01:04:04,764 --> 01:04:06,756
Don't hide your pistol

805
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:10,193
I know what's on your mind

806
01:04:11,724 --> 01:04:16,474
I don't plan to fight with you

807
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:20,693
Let's have a drink together

808
01:04:22,607 --> 01:04:26,506
Omiya! your wife is waiting

809
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,693
You should go home

810
01:04:31,303 --> 01:04:33,865
Oh Aoyagi

811
01:04:35,467 --> 01:04:38,295
Long time no see

812
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:41,678
Are you Kenpei support leader now?

813
01:04:42,060 --> 01:04:42,779
Yes

814
01:04:43,178 --> 01:04:43,912
You?

815
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:45,771
I'm still first grade

816
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:50,162
Why you have come here?

817
01:04:51,271 --> 01:04:53,599
It's none of your business

818
01:04:57,115 --> 01:04:58,576
Being Kenpei is easy,right?

819
01:05:01,506 --> 01:05:06,177
I can resign Kenpei anytime.
It's like homeless

820
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:11,732
There are no good people in KENPEI.

821
01:05:16,974 --> 01:05:17,553
I'll go home

822
01:05:17,756 --> 01:05:18,592
Why?

823
01:05:19,553 --> 01:05:20,529
I'm upset

824
01:05:21,662 --> 01:05:27,584
Hey Aoyagi,
I know your secret

825
01:05:34,342 --> 01:05:35,287
Secret?

826
01:05:35,607 --> 01:05:39,732
He killed a woman and a soldier

827
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,076
See you again

828
01:05:43,357 --> 01:05:45,474
Get home safe

829
01:05:45,646 --> 01:05:48,178
You too!

830
01:05:48,951 --> 01:05:49,638
What's wrong?

831
01:05:49,873 --> 01:05:50,537
Let's pee

832
01:05:50,584 --> 01:05:52,068
I won't

833
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:55,068
Ok let's go home

834
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:56,084
Hey

835
01:05:56,732 --> 01:06:00,286
I want to drink more.
Buy some sake

836
01:06:00,311 --> 01:06:02,217
Let's go home

837
01:06:02,242 --> 01:06:03,685
Where are you going?

838
01:06:03,725 --> 01:06:05,349
I'll buy some

839
01:06:05,428 --> 01:06:06,326
Do you have money?

840
01:06:07,178 --> 01:06:08,474
Take care

841
01:06:08,499 --> 01:06:09,420
leave it to me

842
01:06:27,672 --> 01:06:28,383
Gunshots!

843
01:06:30,468 --> 01:06:32,561
Bungo was shot!!!

844
01:06:35,553 --> 01:06:38,717
He was buried as a war dead man.

845
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:43,523
We had our own funeral separately.

846
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:48,640
At that day Aoyagi came here for some reason

847
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:07,031
Hey, too long

848
01:07:08,327 --> 01:07:11,515
Ok, I'll stop

849
01:07:12,976 --> 01:07:15,351
Please burn incense in order.

850
01:07:41,218 --> 01:07:42,413
You know that?

851
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:52,851
He was saying like that..but he was died

852
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,031
I need to talk with you

853
01:08:20,312 --> 01:08:20,991
What?

854
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:23,765
I looked in you

855
01:08:26,085 --> 01:08:28,507
I need to talk with you about it.
Let's change place

856
01:08:29,882 --> 01:08:30,999
Come to backyard later

857
01:08:32,476 --> 01:08:33,476
I'll wait there

858
01:08:44,937 --> 01:08:45,671
Big boss

859
01:08:52,148 --> 01:08:53,202
What did he say?

860
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:55,765
He's left

861
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:56,843
He's left?

862
01:09:00,148 --> 01:09:02,257
I know he shot Bungo

863
01:09:03,343 --> 01:09:04,507
Did you see his attitude?

864
01:09:06,937 --> 01:09:11,991
He came to the funeral.
We were fooled by him

865
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:14,382
Bungo might be upset

866
01:09:14,407 --> 01:09:15,257
Don't be upset

867
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,374
I have no choice but angry

868
01:09:18,749 --> 01:09:21,460
You're a coward.
I'll talk to him

869
01:09:21,485 --> 01:09:22,171
Wait

870
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:29,913
Listen, We have no evidence that he killed Bungo

871
01:09:30,179 --> 01:09:33,312
And he knew we are run away solider

872
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:34,749
So I need to talk with him

873
01:09:34,774 --> 01:09:35,632
It's not good

874
01:09:38,343 --> 01:09:41,710
Actually I have promised to talk with him

875
01:09:42,312 --> 01:09:45,632
He plan to deal something as I thought

876
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,320
He might kill you

877
01:09:50,382 --> 01:09:51,968
If you come, It might be happen

878
01:09:52,101 --> 01:09:54,734
Big boss, Here is not Japan

879
01:09:55,695 --> 01:09:57,421
Killing people is easy.

880
01:09:58,304 --> 01:09:59,671
He has a pistol

881
01:10:00,734 --> 01:10:03,046
He killed Bungo in the mid night

882
01:10:03,071 --> 01:10:04,429
Leave it to me

883
01:10:05,015 --> 01:10:07,374
I have my own way

884
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:13,476
I need to support you

885
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:18,929
You!
You can't trust me?

886
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:24,382
You stay here.
This is my order

887
01:10:29,601 --> 01:10:33,046
You have your wife

888
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:35,288
You should think of her

889
01:11:07,361 --> 01:11:08,924
I'm glad you stay here

890
01:11:10,244 --> 01:11:11,611
But I know you'll go

891
01:11:12,814 --> 01:11:14,955
Don't worry about me

892
01:11:15,556 --> 01:11:16,596
Please go

893
01:11:38,140 --> 01:11:40,195
What do you want to talk to me?

894
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:43,765
I looked in you

895
01:11:45,062 --> 01:11:49,390
You run away 3 times, and stole supplies

896
01:11:52,078 --> 01:11:55,844
Besides that, there were some

897
01:11:56,899 --> 01:11:57,868
Why you don't arrest me?

898
01:11:58,173 --> 01:11:59,555
You want to be arrested?

899
01:12:02,548 --> 01:12:03,563
I don't think so

900
01:12:04,548 --> 01:12:07,399
Being comfort women station manager is much fun

901
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:13,798
I also feel fun.
I won't get promotion even if I arrest you

902
01:12:18,016 --> 01:12:20,719
No one know about you so far

903
01:12:20,937 --> 01:12:21,875
I'm the only person who know it

904
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:28,773
If you want to buy this information, I can sell

905
01:12:29,477 --> 01:12:31,531
But it costs a lot. Because For your life.

906
01:12:33,531 --> 01:12:34,398
How much?

907
01:12:37,641 --> 01:12:41,000
5000yen per person, with Omiya, it becomes 100000yen

908
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:43,984
I don't have such a money

909
01:12:45,219 --> 01:12:46,703
Make it if you don't have

910
01:12:52,531 --> 01:12:56,945
I will arrest you if you can't

911
01:12:59,977 --> 01:13:00,766
That dude

912
01:13:03,477 --> 01:13:04,812
I'll kill you

913
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,219
Bullshit!

914
01:13:10,734 --> 01:13:13,258
I fire a pistol better than you

915
01:13:14,687 --> 01:13:15,680
Line up!

916
01:13:17,062 --> 01:13:18,273
Damn it!

917
01:13:32,148 --> 01:13:33,109
You!

918
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,133
I'll train you!

919
01:13:50,726 --> 01:13:52,366
We're very tough

920
01:13:53,687 --> 01:13:54,875
Remember it!

921
01:13:55,516 --> 01:13:57,453
This is for nothing!

922
01:14:03,932 --> 01:14:05,104
Say the truth

923
01:14:24,958 --> 01:14:26,364
You bastard!

924
01:14:27,450 --> 01:14:28,958
You bastard!

925
01:14:30,036 --> 01:14:31,231
You bastard!

926
01:14:41,007 --> 01:14:44,304
KENPEITAI's torture was intense.

927
01:14:46,351 --> 01:14:52,015
Every day this torture would kill us both.

928
01:14:53,788 --> 01:14:54,531
Wait

929
01:14:57,266 --> 01:14:58,125
You give up?

930
01:15:00,156 --> 01:15:03,891
I want to talk with your boss

931
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:05,047
What?

932
01:15:21,172 --> 01:15:21,945
What?

933
01:15:23,649 --> 01:15:27,141
Can you untie us?

934
01:15:27,688 --> 01:15:28,453
I can't

935
01:15:28,977 --> 01:15:30,149
Say it

936
01:15:32,188 --> 01:15:35,586
You've had your fill of torture, haven't you?

937
01:15:37,086 --> 01:15:41,688
Can you release me?

938
01:15:42,008 --> 01:15:42,766
What?

939
01:15:44,110 --> 01:15:47,329
We did nothing but run away

940
01:15:48,197 --> 01:15:55,197
Two run away solders have nothing to do with your promotion.

941
01:15:56,072 --> 01:16:02,565
It's safer for you to release us now

942
01:16:03,033 --> 01:16:05,377
Shut your mouth!

943
01:16:11,997 --> 01:16:12,856
Listen

944
01:16:14,819 --> 01:16:24,631
If you court-martial us, I will expose you for opening a gambling house near the Ryuguu comfort station.

945
01:16:26,389 --> 01:16:31,116
You'll be over if we expose it

946
01:16:31,264 --> 01:16:32,428
Shut your mouth!

947
01:16:33,225 --> 01:16:34,889
I won't afraid of it

948
01:16:35,873 --> 01:16:39,998
I'll also talk about your subordinate Aoyagi

949
01:16:40,655 --> 01:16:44,483
He killed Bungo first grade solider.
He used to kill a woman and a solider

950
01:16:45,655 --> 01:16:49,170
And you will be held accountable for it.

951
01:16:52,183 --> 01:16:54,629
Would you still court-martial us?

952
01:16:55,801 --> 01:16:56,457
Tell me

953
01:16:58,207 --> 01:16:59,785
Is that all you want to say?

954
01:17:01,621 --> 01:17:04,980
I'll teach you how Kenpei is strong

955
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:06,871
Aoyagi

956
01:17:07,191 --> 01:17:07,762
Yes

957
01:17:11,445 --> 01:17:13,491
We will not court martial them.

958
01:17:14,702 --> 01:17:16,390
Release them tonight

959
01:17:17,007 --> 01:17:17,437
Yes

960
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:37,142
You're so stupid

961
01:17:39,993 --> 01:17:42,618
You should have dealed with me.
You will be killed

962
01:17:49,251 --> 01:17:50,509
Are you killing us?

963
01:17:50,946 --> 01:17:52,556
You'll be released

964
01:17:53,741 --> 01:17:54,773
as dead body

965
01:17:57,468 --> 01:17:58,437
You...

966
01:18:00,585 --> 01:18:01,405
Are you human being?

967
01:18:02,125 --> 01:18:04,789
A court-martial will condemn you all to death.

968
01:18:06,046 --> 01:18:09,914
We'll cut the process

969
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:16,210
Give me your hands.
I'll unlock you

970
01:18:31,707 --> 01:18:32,465
Give me your hands.

971
01:19:12,797 --> 01:19:13,516
You bustard

972
01:19:24,852 --> 01:19:25,868
You bustard

973
01:19:36,027 --> 01:19:36,996
You bustard

974
01:19:42,271 --> 01:19:43,201
Omiya

975
01:20:05,562 --> 01:20:06,929
Line up!

976
01:20:14,803 --> 01:20:16,046
Put your pistols out

977
01:20:17,827 --> 01:20:19,249
Put your pistols out

978
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:27,030
You bustard

979
01:20:28,007 --> 01:20:31,030
You said You 'll teach you how Kenpei is strong

980
01:20:40,562 --> 01:20:43,616
I 'll teach you how Kisaburo Omiya is strong

981
01:20:51,740 --> 01:20:52,443
Get out in front

982
01:20:52,755 --> 01:20:53,294
Yes

983
01:21:03,455 --> 01:21:04,564
Stand up

984
01:21:07,494 --> 01:21:08,760
Are you Senior soldier?

985
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:10,533
Bring it on

986
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:13,898
What the hell

987
01:21:29,629 --> 01:21:30,403
Next

988
01:21:32,668 --> 01:21:33,848
Who's next

989
01:21:36,809 --> 01:21:37,755
You

990
01:21:46,989 --> 01:21:48,356
I want to talk to you

991
01:21:49,106 --> 01:21:50,028
want to talk?

992
01:21:50,239 --> 01:21:50,879
Yes

993
01:21:59,216 --> 01:22:00,083
Next

994
01:22:24,978 --> 01:22:25,736
Omiya!

995
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:32,158
Is it a grenade?

996
01:22:32,252 --> 01:22:33,689
I'll beat you

997
01:22:37,638 --> 01:22:38,771
You bustard

998
01:22:41,716 --> 01:22:42,544
Come on

999
01:22:46,835 --> 01:22:47,734
Come on

1000
01:22:53,140 --> 01:22:58,242
I will beat you!

1001
01:23:25,763 --> 01:23:27,708
Catch them!

1002
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:34,516
Omiya!

1003
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,539
We did it

1004
01:25:00,907 --> 01:25:03,367
Omiya,You are so...

1005
01:25:04,149 --> 01:25:05,797
You want to say I'm so stupid

1006
01:25:06,055 --> 01:25:08,571
Well, where shall we go from now on?

1007
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:23,421
THE END

2
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:21,811
I live alone in this apartment room 31.

3
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:25,645
But until recently, I was with my sister.

4
00:00:27,075 --> 00:00:28,770
She worked for a magazine.

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,996
I went to a dressmaking school.

6
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:35,489
I was happy even in such an ordinary life.

7
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:42,903
BUt, it was one Sunday morning about three months ago.

8
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:46,312
On no sis.

9
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:52,781
I bought this because you said you were going to see your uncle in Sendai.

10
00:00:52,806 --> 00:00:54,883
Sorry.
I was totally careless

11
00:00:54,984 --> 00:00:55,867
I'll put it in your bag.

12
00:00:57,367 --> 00:00:59,109
I'm sure your uncle will be very pleased.

13
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:03,195
I don't know.
He's going to tell me to get married already.

14
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,384
It's cold so you should bring a sweater.

15
00:01:06,736 --> 00:01:09,447
I don't want to increase my luggage.

16
00:01:09,994 --> 00:01:13,798
And I'm traveling alone anyway, so why try to dress up?

17
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:15,517
You never know, something good might happen.

18
00:01:18,236 --> 00:01:21,259
You meet a great guy at the hotel.

19
00:01:21,353 --> 00:01:22,056
No way.

20
00:01:22,572 --> 00:01:23,548
I'm going.

21
00:01:23,573 --> 00:01:24,587
Oh yeah.

22
00:01:26,245 --> 00:01:28,214
This is your employee handbook

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,831
Thank you

24
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,143
Why don't you bring this?

25
00:01:34,612 --> 00:01:35,682
A Mascot?

26
00:01:35,722 --> 00:01:37,456
It's a good luck charm.

27
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:40,284
It's all right.

28
00:01:43,435 --> 00:01:45,279
You're going out?

29
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:48,919
Oh, it's gonna rain.

30
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:51,068
Not bad.
Traveling alone in the rain.

31
00:01:52,935 --> 00:01:54,294
Thank you for staying at home.

32
00:01:55,771 --> 00:01:57,739
Please buy some Sendai miso.

33
00:02:00,138 --> 00:02:01,036
Take care.

34
00:02:03,613 --> 00:02:06,222
My sister looked so happy that day.

35
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:14,543
I thought it was because she was free from her busy work and could take a relaxing trip to Tohoku.

36
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:18,705
And yet, that very next night...

37
00:02:21,244 --> 00:02:23,041
Excuse me.

38
00:02:23,073 --> 00:02:23,752
Hello?

39
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,307
You've got a big problem.

40
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:32,088
I just got a call from the police.
Actually, your sister has been killed in a punishing accident!

41
00:02:33,822 --> 00:02:35,565
Accident? Where?

42
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:38,182
Just outside of Hamamatsu.

43
00:02:42,965 --> 00:02:46,574
She was on a trip to Tohoku, and now she's dead in Hamamatsu.

44
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:49,113
I couldn't believe it.

45
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:55,535
She never lied to me before.

46
00:03:02,344 --> 00:03:03,258
Please come in.

47
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:32,637
She passed away yesterday at 19:23.

48
00:03:41,484 --> 00:03:42,266
Sis..

49
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:47,735
Sis..

50
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,321
What are you doing?

51
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,836
It's an interview.
I'm from weekly times.

52
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,422
That's rude.
I can't believe you took this part.

53
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:00,821
I don't think so.
The bus company is clearly responsible for this accident.

54
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:04,172
That's what journalism is all about, isn't it?

55
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:07,625
Anyway, I'd appreciate it if you'd refrain from doing so.

56
00:04:07,883 --> 00:04:09,313
You don't have to push.

57
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,729
I'm terribly sorry to hear that.

58
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:25,112
It was raining so hard at the time of the accident that there was no visibility.

59
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:30,409
A temporary freight train was approaching the crossing.

60
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:35,292
The driver also said that he had no choice but to get out of the way.

61
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:44,244
Another second or two. another second or two, the whole bus would have escaped.

62
00:04:44,947 --> 00:04:50,728
I'm very sorry for the passengers in the back seat.

63
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:57,765
At first, we couldn't identify your sister.
We were very concerned.

64
00:04:58,957 --> 00:05:00,887
And we know it's rude, but...

65
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:05,996
We went through her suitcase and handbag.

66
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,723
but there was not a single piece of clothing that gave us any clues.

67
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:14,660
Finally, we found the name of the tailor on her clothes,
I was able to find out where she lived.

68
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:18,695
I believe I found an employee handbook in here.

69
00:05:19,187 --> 00:05:20,273
Oh..

70
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:24,632
But if she had something like that, We would have identified her right away.

71
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:27,757
So it's gone..

72
00:05:27,782 --> 00:05:29,156
No, I don't think so.

73
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:35,921
The handbag came out from under the seat in front of the bus, still in the suitcase.

74
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,578
he seat in front of the bus?

75
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:43,258
Wasn't she sitting in the back?

76
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:48,266
As a matter of fact, someone told us...

77
00:05:48,906 --> 00:05:51,258
She had a companion.

78
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:52,664
Companion?

79
00:05:53,594 --> 00:05:58,844
She was sitting in the front with her companion until just before the train departed.

80
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,141
We tried to find the passenger.

81
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,633
It was just a man of good looks.

82
00:06:07,302 --> 00:06:10,365
Who said such a thing?

83
00:06:10,724 --> 00:06:14,896
Tsuneko Saito, a waitress at the Marufuji Restaurant.

84
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:20,404
I didn't think it was possible that my sister had a boyfriend.

85
00:06:21,029 --> 00:06:23,099
The next day I went to see her.

86
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:29,006
But Tsuneko Saito had left the restaurant yesterday.

87
00:06:31,168 --> 00:06:32,676
Naked Island, Yamanashi Prefecture

88
00:06:34,215 --> 00:06:39,238
After hearing only the address of Tsuneko-san's parents' house
I decided to go back to Tokyo

89
00:06:43,849 --> 00:06:45,818
After that, I was contacted by a magazine company.

90
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:49,435
I had to work in place of my sister.

91
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:57,013
At the time, I thought I had made the decision to join the company because I just missed the smell of my sister's scent.

92
00:06:57,831 --> 00:07:01,753
But the truth is that I didn't know about my sister's life

93
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:10,034
In the shadow of my sister whom I loved I think I wanted to find out who that man was. Maybe I wanted to find him

94
00:07:11,643 --> 00:07:16,932
In that black, black sea of trees

95
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:28,400
Kuroi Jukai / Black Sea of Trees (1960)

96
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:20,283
I've done it.

97
00:08:25,112 --> 00:08:26,151
Editor!

98
00:08:27,128 --> 00:08:29,714
Kasahara,Please bring me the manuscript.

99
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:30,159
Yes.

100
00:08:31,987 --> 00:08:33,721
You graduate from trainees hip, right?

101
00:08:34,206 --> 00:08:35,417
Which one?

102
00:08:35,698 --> 00:08:37,635
modern woman magazine,Seno Ikuo

103
00:08:38,198 --> 00:08:40,112
Ask Machida for the address.

104
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,095
Come in.

105
00:08:50,752 --> 00:08:52,736
Welcome,
I'm Seno.

106
00:08:53,564 --> 00:08:56,002
I'm Sachiko Kasahara, the newest member of our team.

107
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,627
Thank you very much.

108
00:08:58,048 --> 00:08:59,845
Kasahara...

109
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,205
I'm the sister of Nobuko Kasahara, who passed away.

110
00:09:04,736 --> 00:09:07,423
I knew it.

111
00:09:10,184 --> 00:09:13,598
I'm so steeped in the foreign way of life.

112
00:09:14,668 --> 00:09:18,527
She was so nice.
I'm sorry.

113
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,105
A car accident, I think.

114
00:09:22,074 --> 00:09:25,254
Did you know her well?

115
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,349
She used to come to me to pick up my manuscripts.

116
00:09:29,786 --> 00:09:32,076
So just I know.

117
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:34,905
Kasahara.

118
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:38,944
Did you hug with him?

119
00:09:42,003 --> 00:09:43,815
He said it was a custom when he went abroad.

120
00:09:45,479 --> 00:09:47,151
I doubt he's ever been abroad.

121
00:09:49,331 --> 00:09:53,784
He told like If you don't understand a word in the manuscript, just ask.
Did he ever touch your hand?

122
00:09:55,073 --> 00:09:58,245
Kind of.
Does he do that to anyone?

123
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,603
How did you feel?

124
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,775
He's dirty.

125
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,853
He's play boy.

126
00:10:14,394 --> 00:10:16,582
I hear Nobuko was into him.

127
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,371
I'm the only one who knows.

128
00:10:18,675 --> 00:10:21,003
What do you mean by that?

129
00:10:24,557 --> 00:10:26,065
Why you don't know?

130
00:10:26,104 --> 00:10:27,416
I don't know anything.

131
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:32,081
It could be.

132
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,846
She didn't think she could tell her sister that.

133
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:37,815
Let's go out!

134
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,471
Now?

135
00:10:38,745 --> 00:10:39,706
Machida.

136
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,721
I'd like you to tell me more.

137
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,182
About your sister?

138
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,456
Tomorrow's fine.

139
00:10:45,792 --> 00:10:46,690
You won't go?

140
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:50,745
We're hosting the Christmas party tonight.
It's a good chance to show your face.

141
00:10:51,766 --> 00:10:53,797
But I don't feel like it.

142
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:55,813
Let's go out!

143
00:10:56,063 --> 00:10:56,875
What's this?

144
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:59,735
A gift for my brother.

145
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,203
You are a good sister.

146
00:11:01,228 --> 00:11:02,399
How dare you.

147
00:11:09,867 --> 00:11:12,586
I hear Nobuko was into him.

148
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,742
I'm the only one who knows.

149
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,463
Why you don't know?

150
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:26,416
It could be.
She didn't think she could tell her sister that.

151
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,569
About your sister?
Tomorrow's fine

152
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,588
Good morning.

153
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,299
Are you hangover?

154
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:42,291
Good morning.

155
00:11:42,713 --> 00:11:45,323
Our Christmas parties have become a bit of a tradition.

156
00:11:45,448 --> 00:11:47,275
There were bunch of cultural people

157
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,947
But ending at 8:00 is a little too early.

158
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,612
Ending at 8:00 is just fine.

159
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,721
Everyone is busy on Christmas.

160
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:54,831
Good morning.

161
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,964
Yes, Editor office.

162
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:01,355
Machida has not come yet.

163
00:12:01,964 --> 00:12:02,831
Who?

164
00:12:03,175 --> 00:12:04,683
Police?

165
00:12:08,187 --> 00:12:11,304
What?
Machida was killed?

166
00:12:13,507 --> 00:12:15,226
I see.
His Identification.

167
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:21,937
But Machida would've had his employee handbook.
He would've figured it out right away.

168
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,081
He didn't have it?

169
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:36,098
The autopsy results place the murder around midnight last night.

170
00:12:36,785 --> 00:12:41,644
The investigation team estimates...
Ms. Machida was with the murderer.
They walked around Ginza on Christmas Eve,

171
00:12:41,996 --> 00:12:46,144
Between 10:00 and 11:00 p.m., she was taken to the Tama River by car.

172
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:55,488
The suspect is believed to be a close friend of Ms. Machida's.

173
00:12:55,808 --> 00:13:02,753
The task force is investigating a cab heading toward the crime scene from the Ginza and Shibuya areas at that time.

174
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,750
Looks like the crime scene is here.

175
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,164
Stop here.

176
00:13:12,046 --> 00:13:12,937
Are you alright?

177
00:14:45,569 --> 00:14:47,015
Oh you ...

178
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:54,124
I saw you at the hospital in Hamamatsu.

179
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,961
What are you doing?

180
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:00,313
Just little..

181
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:01,625
Just little..?

182
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,797
I wanted to see the crime scene.

183
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:05,305
Crime scene?

184
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:09,993
As I recall, your sister also worked in the women's magazine.

185
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:15,195
But why did you want to see it?

186
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,742
I was just curious about something.

187
00:15:18,124 --> 00:15:18,929
Curious?

188
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,240
I'm the brother of the murdered Tomoe Machida.

189
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:34,058
You?

190
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:36,559
I was surprised.

191
00:15:37,152 --> 00:15:40,449
You know what they say.
The killer always arrives at the scene of the crime once.

192
00:15:41,426 --> 00:15:41,887
So.

193
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,996
Well, I was thinking the same thing.

194
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,387
You said you were just curious about something.What's that?

195
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,199
Maybe I'm imagining things.

196
00:15:55,652 --> 00:15:59,113
It's like what happened to my sister.

197
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:00,910
For what?

198
00:16:02,684 --> 00:16:04,988
My sister's employee handbook was also missing.

199
00:16:05,512 --> 00:16:06,270
Employee handbook?

200
00:16:07,457 --> 00:16:11,254
I just don't think it was a coincidence.

201
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:14,035
So you're saying your sister was killed too?

202
00:16:14,543 --> 00:16:17,449
No. My sister's death was an accident.

203
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,082
But according to the bus company...

204
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:25,707
She was with a man.

205
00:16:27,504 --> 00:16:34,035
So you think he and my sister's killer My sister's murderer could be the same person.

206
00:16:35,217 --> 00:16:35,780
Yes.

207
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:37,803
I see.

208
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,803
Well, that would mean that the man is a mutual acquaintance.

209
00:16:43,077 --> 00:16:45,882
If your sister were to travel with you. What would he be like?

210
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:50,335
I think it was just a business associate.

211
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:53,444
Then it would be the writer who was in charge.

212
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:59,429
Wait a minute. If it was a writer, that narrows it down to a few mystery people.

213
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,186
Really?

214
00:17:04,475 --> 00:17:10,343
 Your sister, my sister, and the writer that they both worked for, and pick out the one that they both had in common.

215
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:13,700
This would definitely mean they knew each other in common.

216
00:17:14,653 --> 00:17:16,379
Well, it's true.

217
00:17:17,497 --> 00:17:19,270
What?
He's hangover?

218
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:21,536
Did you come back to work because of it?

219
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,364
He says he's been drunk since Christmas night.

220
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:31,411
He is the most popular writer at the magazine company here.
Ask him.

221
00:17:34,844 --> 00:17:37,102
You are in trouble.

222
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:39,070
I'm in trouble.

223
00:17:40,063 --> 00:17:42,250
He used to be your sister's agent.

224
00:17:42,313 --> 00:17:44,024
With Machida,right?

225
00:17:44,906 --> 00:17:47,273
I'm sure he'll put you in charge.

226
00:17:47,945 --> 00:17:49,414
Why?

227
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:51,125
You met him at the tailoring exhibition, didn't you?

228
00:17:51,211 --> 00:17:53,688
When you went to buy fabric for my dress?

229
00:17:53,883 --> 00:17:57,696
He said.
You have a nice figure, so I'd like to model for you.

230
00:17:59,657 --> 00:18:01,852
You should go to wake him up.

231
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:02,860
Help me.

232
00:18:03,235 --> 00:18:04,422
Hey,Ando.

233
00:18:05,438 --> 00:18:06,313
I'm counting on you.

234
00:18:06,977 --> 00:18:08,547
There is one better than me.

235
00:18:15,649 --> 00:18:18,681
Hello, this is Kasahara from the Women's Club. Is there Uno?

236
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:21,571
Oh you are.

237
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:25,587
I'm in a bit of a panic over Tsurumaki Sensei.

238
00:18:25,681 --> 00:18:26,985
I don't know that guy.

239
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:29,767
After the Eve party , he left me in Ginza...

240
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:33,509
I knew you were with him.

241
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,071
I know.

242
00:18:35,423 --> 00:18:36,985
Why?

243
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:39,751
Tsurumaki's in love with your sister too!

244
00:18:42,957 --> 00:18:44,168
How was it?

245
00:18:44,894 --> 00:18:45,535
I couldn’t.

246
00:18:45,988 --> 00:18:48,691
You'd better catch him at the party tonight.

247
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:54,951
I'm the editor.
It's me.

248
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:00,068
Mr. Machida?
Thank you for the evening.

249
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,045
Have you done your research yet?
What about the mystery people?

250
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:11,172
Four?
That's not so many.

251
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:14,680
Shall we go to the Journalist Club's New Year's Eve party tonight?

252
00:19:15,782 --> 00:19:17,969
I'm sure all four of them will be there.

253
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:19,618
I'll see you there.

254
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:02,149
We are in the middle of a party, and Mr. SAJIKI is here.

255
00:20:09,024 --> 00:20:16,875
He's got a thousand or so chapters all over the country, hundreds of thousands of students. He's a modern-day monster, a kind of religious guru.

256
00:20:18,149 --> 00:20:20,501
He's doing other things besides teaching ikebana.

257
00:20:30,598 --> 00:20:32,317
Reiko Sajiji is the one dancing with SENO.

258
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:35,192
That's Sajiki hakuun's only daughter.

259
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:48,458
Is that Dr. Santaro Nishiwaki of Cosmetic Surgery?

260
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:52,794
He's the Sajiki family's doctor and very trusted by the ladies.

261
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:57,286
Rumor has it that his hospital is much capitalized by the ladies.

262
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:12,298
Women are cute.

263
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:15,572
No matter how much they say bad things to me, I can't hate them.

264
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:20,516
Women are cute.

265
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:23,938
Sajiki Nishiwaki SENO TSURUMAKI

266
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,400
Can we narrow down the suspects to these four after all?

267
00:21:26,611 --> 00:21:30,126
If it was those four guys, it would have been in the employee handbooks of two of them.

268
00:21:30,611 --> 00:21:33,197
They are people of high social status who care about their appearance.

269
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:36,072
Well, then, I'll start looking into alibis tonight.

270
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:39,470
Aren't you going to go to your sister's funeral?

271
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:44,438
Funerals don't mean a thing unless the killer's up there.

272
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:47,591
I'll check Tsurumaki at the beginning.

273
00:21:49,646 --> 00:21:51,364
I'll give it a try.

274
00:22:01,456 --> 00:22:03,425
I'm jealous of you.

275
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:05,308
You're funny.

276
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:09,667
Where did you go after the Christmas party?

277
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,206
Why?

278
00:22:11,846 --> 00:22:13,706
I'm annoyed.

279
00:22:14,315 --> 00:22:17,362
Seno thought I was with you.

280
00:22:17,471 --> 00:22:20,823
There's no problem with that either.

281
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:23,674
Where did you go after the Christmas party?

282
00:22:24,198 --> 00:22:27,003
I'll tell you if you stay with me tonight.

283
00:22:27,297 --> 00:22:28,445
What do you think?

284
00:22:32,047 --> 00:22:34,617
Oh, you're here.
Come dance with me

285
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:50,149
I've been asked to go back to France next year as a cultural envoy.

286
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:54,375
But even if I go there, I can't do any business.

287
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:59,093
I don't actually want to go to France.

288
00:23:00,656 --> 00:23:02,843
Have a nice day

289
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:07,101
It was a nice timing.
Why don't you guys come in?

290
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:10,653
Please come in.

291
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,716
Hello, may I ask you a few questions?

292
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,872
You'll be in Kyoto and Osaka next month for a workshop.
You've been busy since the beginning of the New Year

293
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:24,310
How have you spent Christmas?

294
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:29,715
After the party, ONO, Sakurako-san and I went to a bar.

295
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:30,506
Then?

296
00:23:30,716 --> 00:23:32,318
I think I was just walking around Ginza.

297
00:23:32,343 --> 00:23:33,310
Alone?

298
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:35,881
Yes.
I was just trying to relax.

299
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:38,115
It's like secret.

300
00:23:38,287 --> 00:23:39,256
What time you back home?

301
00:23:41,388 --> 00:23:44,771
I thought it was just gravure photos?
That's not what was promised.

302
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,310
I guess it's up to the reporter to make the most of the photogravure.

303
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:49,912
I'm interested in you, so I'd like to ask you a lot of questions.

304
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:50,959
Sekiya.

305
00:23:56,674 --> 00:23:59,221
Hey!

306
00:24:34,715 --> 00:24:36,028
I'm sorry to bother you.

307
00:24:36,053 --> 00:24:37,294
Hello?

308
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:40,208
But I'm sick of office girls these days.

309
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:44,107
They want you to have a nose like Elizabeth Taylor.

310
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:46,161
Have a seat.

311
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:48,613
The manuscript is ready.

312
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:53,786
I know my schedule's a little crowded and I'm a little weak, but I feel bad for your sister that I'm bothering you.

313
00:24:53,888 --> 00:24:56,099
I'm sorry. That's very kind of you.

314
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:00,466
I'm going to Yokohama now.
Wanna go?

315
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:03,396
I have to deliver this to the company.

316
00:25:04,342 --> 00:25:07,490
Tomorrow will be fine.
Wanna go to night club?

317
00:25:07,826 --> 00:25:09,006
I'm a gentleman.
You don't have to worry.

318
00:25:09,498 --> 00:25:11,896
But I don't go such a place.

319
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,420
Well, that's too bad.
Your sister used to come here all the time.

320
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:30,090
Did my sister spend a lot of nights out with you?

321
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:35,489
She was a friendly person.
She would come wherever I invited her.

322
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:38,759
Where?

323
00:25:39,517 --> 00:25:41,017
What kind of places?

324
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:46,291
Don't be so sure.

325
00:25:51,578 --> 00:25:53,008
I'll light the cigarette.

326
00:26:13,415 --> 00:26:14,071
You can dance.

327
00:26:14,274 --> 00:26:17,274
Your step is nice.

328
00:26:17,962 --> 00:26:21,446
I bet you had a lot to drink and dance about on Christmas Eve.

329
00:26:22,141 --> 00:26:24,321
I was at your office party.

330
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:28,727
You weren't there.
Out with your girlfriend?

331
00:26:29,618 --> 00:26:30,915
I'll leave that to your imagination.

332
00:26:31,532 --> 00:26:35,946
I heard that the party ended around 8:00 p.m. What did you do afterwards?

333
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:38,665
I'll leave that to your imagination too.

334
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,899
Then I'll decide that you went somewhere with a beautiful woman.

335
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,016
Don't make fun of me.

336
00:26:51,258 --> 00:26:52,039
Excuse me.

337
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,969
I'm sorry you couldn't make it tonight.

338
00:26:58,063 --> 00:27:01,227
Well, that's why my plans have changed.
Can I get you something to drink?

339
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,813
I hear something about you.

340
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:07,571
Don't get me wrong.

341
00:27:07,664 --> 00:27:09,446
It's up to you.

342
00:27:09,938 --> 00:27:14,618
I hope you haven't forgotten that you're a major shareholder in your hospital.

343
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:16,312
Madam.

344
00:27:19,566 --> 00:27:20,355
I hate women.

345
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:28,831
I hate everyone you fall for.

346
00:27:29,878 --> 00:27:34,144
Don't bully me.
I was just playing around her.

347
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:38,070
Trust me.

348
00:27:38,414 --> 00:27:42,234
Women these days are so mean.

349
00:27:46,072 --> 00:27:48,150
Dr. Nishiwaki asked you out, didn't he?

350
00:27:48,845 --> 00:27:49,353
Yes.

351
00:27:49,924 --> 00:27:51,157
Don't get too close.

352
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:55,587
He's dangerous.

353
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,896
Oh Madam.

354
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:01,919
Good day to you.

355
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,333
This way, please.

356
00:28:03,802 --> 00:28:06,005
I have an appointment. Excuse me.

357
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,321
Excuse me.
SENO is here often?

358
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:23,829
You know him?

359
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:28,102
Then I could have met him if I had come here on Christmas Eve, too.

360
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:32,125
He drank till dawn that day and passed out.

361
00:28:32,516 --> 00:28:33,766
I was tried.

362
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:36,852
Welcome.
Thank you for coming.

363
00:28:38,766 --> 00:28:41,531
I wanted to talk to you more last night, but...

364
00:28:41,696 --> 00:28:46,165
I was about to leave.
But when I found the doctor and you, I got curious.

365
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:49,532
I think Dr. Nishiaki is a good person.

366
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:53,547
What's so dangerous about him?

367
00:28:53,672 --> 00:28:54,586
Yeah.

368
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:58,875
He'll make you feel familiar and secure, and then he'll go for that opening.

369
00:29:00,141 --> 00:29:04,461
I know you think I'm lying.
Dr. Nishiaki's relationships with women are wildly unpredictable.

370
00:29:08,182 --> 00:29:10,940
He's definitely secretive, right?

371
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:16,557
He's a champion of sex medicine.
If a scandal broke, he'd be dead on his feet.

372
00:29:17,706 --> 00:29:18,221
So.

373
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,253
No way.

374
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:23,010
He's so afraid that Mrs. Sajiki will find out about it.

375
00:29:23,651 --> 00:29:27,440
He is trying so hard to please her, He looks like a man-maid.

376
00:29:27,534 --> 00:29:29,284
You're so mean.

377
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,424
I don't want to slander people, but...

378
00:29:34,705 --> 00:29:36,682
Do you know the Asahi Hotel in Shinjuku?

379
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,518
That's where they meet every night.

380
00:29:40,604 --> 00:29:43,174
I wonder if Dr. Sajiki knows about this.

381
00:29:43,268 --> 00:29:44,448
He knows.

382
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,901
He likes Sekiya, the secretary.

383
00:29:49,846 --> 00:29:51,409
That makes two of us.

384
00:29:55,979 --> 00:29:59,401
Why are you telling me all this?

385
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,339
Well..

386
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:05,292
Because I don't want Nishiaki to take someone like you

387
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:09,721
I like you.

388
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,573
I like you.

389
00:30:13,471 --> 00:30:15,987
Sachiko-san, Sachiko-san...

390
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:22,307
You say that because I'm like my sister.

391
00:30:25,076 --> 00:30:26,576
Sachiko-san

392
00:30:30,802 --> 00:30:31,974
Hello!

393
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,435
Good morning.

394
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:38,029
Good morning.

395
00:30:38,115 --> 00:30:39,865
How's it?

396
00:30:40,162 --> 00:30:41,349
Well, I'm getting there.

397
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,591
You think we're close to finding out who did it?

398
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:46,826
You'll just have to wait and see.
The word "impossible" is not in my dictionary.

399
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,294
Yes, sir. Weekly Times.

400
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:54,364
Yes, yes, he's here.
Machida, call for you.

401
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:55,552
3rd times.

402
00:30:55,747 --> 00:30:58,036
Hello. Oh, Sachiko.

403
00:30:58,528 --> 00:30:59,896
I've just come here.

404
00:31:00,591 --> 00:31:02,419
Yes, yes, I'll be right there.

405
00:31:07,466 --> 00:31:09,568
Husband and Wife do affair?

406
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:13,201
Sajiki and Sekiya Shizuko.
Mrs. Sajiki and Nishiaki.

407
00:31:13,505 --> 00:31:14,614
I'm flabbergasted.

408
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:18,443
That's how it is with people, even people of culture

409
00:31:18,966 --> 00:31:20,044
I don't know if it's like that.

410
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:24,451
Anyway, I'll take care of the alibi checks for these two couples.

411
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:26,146
You'll sure about Seno?

412
00:31:26,294 --> 00:31:28,334
That's what he clearly said at the club.

413
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:31,248
Then TSURUMAKI is the only one who doesn't know who's accompanying him on Christmas Eve.

414
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:35,748
He was not with his lover, Yuriko Uno.

415
00:31:36,732 --> 00:31:39,185
I wasn't with him.

416
00:31:42,111 --> 00:31:43,509
The most suspicious one is Tsurumaki.

417
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:44,720
Welcome

418
00:31:45,283 --> 00:31:46,337
Is he here?

419
00:31:46,525 --> 00:31:48,595
He'll be back soon.

420
00:31:49,884 --> 00:31:53,275
The fabric for the clothes will arrive from Paris, so I want a good design.

421
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,384
I will do this work hard for you.

422
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,040
Please make it as soon as possible

423
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:01,009
We will.

424
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:03,611
Thank you very much.

425
00:32:04,876 --> 00:32:05,501
What can I do for you?

426
00:32:06,298 --> 00:32:10,079
I'd like to clear up a misunderstanding.
I'd like to take a moment of your time.

427
00:32:17,472 --> 00:32:21,784
 I didn't even go to the party on Christmas Eve. I went straight back to my apartment.

428
00:32:24,918 --> 00:32:29,200
So... I'd like to find out who Tsurumaki's girlfriend is.

429
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:35,528
I'm pissed off.
He's so playboy.

430
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:41,157
Tsurumaki was with who  ?

431
00:32:42,024 --> 00:32:43,751
I'd bite him if I knew that.

432
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,743
I think it's because you can't control him.

433
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,915
On Christmas Eve. I heard you were with Sajiki and his secretary Sekiya.

434
00:32:54,736 --> 00:32:59,165
After Tsurumaki escaped, they were caught, so I had no choice.

435
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:02,642
So you were with him all night?

436
00:33:03,493 --> 00:33:06,618
We split up... after 10 o'clock

437
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,548
What's wrong with that?

438
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:14,657
Because you two seem to be getting along so well.

439
00:33:15,439 --> 00:33:17,939
I thought you might have been disturbed.

440
00:33:18,775 --> 00:33:19,400
Yeah.

441
00:33:21,354 --> 00:33:25,425
Two people with a rented room at a tourist hotel in Oku-Nikko.

442
00:33:41,001 --> 00:33:42,009
How was the hotel?

443
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:46,337
I knew it! Sajiki came and stayed with his secretary, Shizuko Sekiya, on Christmas Eve!

444
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:48,144
What time?

445
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:53,777
The time around midnight, almost the same time as the murder of the sister.

446
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:59,356
Nishiaki and Mrs. Sajiki have an alibi at a hotel in Shinjuku.

447
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:01,919
SENO was at a nightclub in Yokohama

448
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,294
Now all that's left is Kanzo Tsurumaki.

449
00:34:07,465 --> 00:34:11,051
I'll look into Tsurumaki.

450
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,622
I doubt you'll find any clues that easily.

451
00:34:14,044 --> 00:34:16,434
I'll find out.

452
00:34:17,971 --> 00:34:21,346
For my sis..

453
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:24,807
But it's not like your sister was murdered.

454
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:33,666
I mean... if he really was with my sister... On the bus in Hamamatsu...

455
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:40,577
I want to ask him why he left her injured and ran away by himself.

456
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,875
I'll give you back your New Year's break and we'll work together.

457
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:02,055
Thank you.

458
00:35:08,171 --> 00:35:10,874
Do you know Sachiko Kasahara's room?

459
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:19,718
If it's Kasahara-san, she's in room 31. but she left this morning.

460
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,218
To where?

461
00:35:21,796 --> 00:35:24,273
To Naked island in Yamanashi.

462
00:35:25,015 --> 00:35:25,921
To Naked island

463
00:35:34,735 --> 00:35:36,126
Yes she was.

464
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,970
My sister was in the front seat of the bus once.

465
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:45,044
I thought she was beautiful.

466
00:35:45,574 --> 00:35:50,147
She was about third from the front.
She was across the aisle from me.

467
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:53,710
She was with a man?

468
00:35:54,687 --> 00:36:00,060
Yes, I thought it was a companion, but the woman moved to the back before I knew it.

469
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:05,018
She was in a lot of pain when the accident happened.
I asked the guy if he was her boyfriend.

470
00:36:05,473 --> 00:36:07,246
But he said, "No, no, no...

471
00:36:09,121 --> 00:36:12,141
You don't remember what he looked like?

472
00:36:20,351 --> 00:36:21,264
Is he in here?

473
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:23,728
I'm sure he is.

474
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:31,403
I don't know.

475
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,993
Take a good look at him.

476
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:36,881
I've forgotten.

477
00:36:38,942 --> 00:36:42,968
Maybe you'd recognize him if you saw him in front of you.

478
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:46,478
I'm sure you'll understand when you see him.

479
00:36:46,586 --> 00:36:49,213
Then why don't you go to Tokyo?

480
00:36:49,855 --> 00:36:52,041
I'm glad to go to Tokyo.

481
00:36:56,357 --> 00:36:58,644
I'm sorry to hear that.
You've been twice.

482
00:36:59,281 --> 00:37:01,841
Maybe he'll stay today.

483
00:37:02,256 --> 00:37:04,862
No. He's going for a day trip, that's for sure.

484
00:37:07,616 --> 00:37:09,049
Oh Sachiko.

485
00:37:09,534 --> 00:37:12,034
I'm back.
Oh machida.

486
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,480
Oh, thank God.
I was just about to leave.

487
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:15,859
I'm sorry.

488
00:37:15,991 --> 00:37:17,211
I heard you went all the way to Yamanashi.

489
00:37:17,431 --> 00:37:21,491
I met her.
I've asked her to come to Tokyo on the Hakuba train the day after tomorrow.

490
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:44,533
She's not here.

491
00:37:45,946 --> 00:37:47,679
Go to ticket gate.

492
00:37:59,386 --> 00:38:08,838
Tsuneko Saito of Naked Island, if you are here
Please come to the office.

493
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:15,638
Tsuneko-san, what time did you catch the train?

494
00:38:17,817 --> 00:38:18,597
I hope that's all right.

495
00:38:19,621 --> 00:38:21,081
Please describe Tsuneko Saito.

496
00:38:21,311 --> 00:38:21,945
What are you going to do?

497
00:38:22,305 --> 00:38:24,198
I'm going to investigate.

498
00:38:24,793 --> 00:38:25,880
What do you mean?

499
00:38:33,931 --> 00:38:35,191
Hi, Editorial Department

500
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:38,328
Kasahara?

501
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,505
Call for you.

502
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:41,545
I'm sorry

503
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,288
Hello, this is Kasahara

504
00:38:45,028 --> 00:38:45,628
Hello?

505
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,103
Hello?

506
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:50,888
Sachiko Kasahara?

507
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:56,498
You'd rather not do a boring investigation.

508
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:01,017
You'll lose your life.

509
00:39:02,768 --> 00:39:03,521
See?

510
00:39:05,164 --> 00:39:06,537
You'll lose your life.

511
00:39:09,604 --> 00:39:10,144
Ok?

512
00:39:50,377 --> 00:39:51,470
Hi, Editorial Department

513
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:53,037
Call for you.

514
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:57,530
Hello, this is Kasahara

515
00:40:00,561 --> 00:40:01,381
Machida?

516
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:06,611
Did you get a reply telegram?
Tsuneko-san is sure she took the Hakuba train.

517
00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:10,305
Tsuneko-san was dead...?

518
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,680
She's Tsuneko-san for sure.

519
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,151
Then Tsuneko Saito, the victim...
Tsuneko Saito was going straight to Shinjuku?

520
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:34,247
But she got off at Tachikawa Station.

521
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,167
The crime scene is near Yanoguchi Station on the Nambu Line.

522
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:42,352
Maybe the victim knew someone there.

523
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:47,391
But Tsuneko knew I was coming to Shinjuku Station to pick her up.

524
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:50,463
I didn't think she got off at Tachikawa Station.

525
00:40:50,577 --> 00:40:54,117
I see.
Someone must have gotten her off at Tachikawa Station.

526
00:40:55,127 --> 00:41:00,234
And is it not conceivable that the Nanbu Line took him from Tachikawa Station to Yannoguchi Station, which is even closer to the site?

527
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:02,622
No, the victim never got off at Yanokuchi Station.

528
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,834
No one at the station claims to have seen her.

529
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:16,803
He's been making strange phone calls to you.
That means the killer knows we're on to him.

530
00:41:17,988 --> 00:41:22,835
That's right.
Ms. Tsuneko was killed because I called her.

531
00:41:23,991 --> 00:41:28,597
He's so bad.
Maybe you should be careful for a few days.

532
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:35,573
I'll do whatever it takes to find out who did it.

533
00:41:36,413 --> 00:41:38,526
If I don't, I'll feel bad for Ms. Tsuneko.

534
00:41:39,784 --> 00:41:43,130
But if anything should happen to you...

535
00:41:48,194 --> 00:41:51,414
Don't worry.
I have a mascot for good luck.

536
00:41:51,687 --> 00:41:52,827
Mascot for good luck?

537
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,177
It's really supposed to protect me.

538
00:41:57,831 --> 00:41:58,457
Funny?

539
00:42:00,263 --> 00:42:00,977
No.

540
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:03,510
Don't laugh?

541
00:42:09,311 --> 00:42:10,011
I'm not laughing.

542
00:42:11,585 --> 00:42:13,945
I'll give you one.

543
00:42:16,669 --> 00:42:19,842
You have to be careful too.

544
00:42:22,137 --> 00:42:23,691
Thank you.

545
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,343
Train is coming.

546
00:42:35,527 --> 00:42:36,120
Hi.

547
00:42:37,626 --> 00:42:40,080
What a incident.

548
00:42:40,163 --> 00:42:42,797
Same here.
Where have you been?

549
00:42:43,318 --> 00:42:44,638
Martial Arts Garden

550
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:47,710
I haven't sketched in a while.

551
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:51,238
Is the seat free?

552
00:42:52,229 --> 00:42:55,182
Someone was sitting here.
Maybe he went to the bathroom.

553
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:58,361
I'm here again.

554
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,949
Who's that woman now?

555
00:43:20,509 --> 00:43:23,342
She's a girl for Uno.
Her name is Machiko.

556
00:43:24,414 --> 00:43:27,934
So Tsurumaki wasn't traveling alone.

557
00:43:28,665 --> 00:43:29,298
Why?

558
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:33,610
Tsurumaki is like Uno's boss.

559
00:43:34,644 --> 00:43:39,271
Of course he knows.
How can he be sitting in the same car with that woman, sitting so far away from her?

560
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:44,902
How about this theory?

561
00:43:45,962 --> 00:43:48,962
He was sitting side by side with her until Tachikawa.

562
00:43:49,816 --> 00:43:54,536
But when he saw us, he said, "This is a bad idea.
She was the only one who moved to the back.

563
00:44:01,401 --> 00:44:02,494
It must be so.

564
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:06,422
I bet they're sitting side by side right now.

565
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:25,996
What's wrong?

566
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:31,985
I was thinking that Machida-san's reasoning earlier applies to my sister.

567
00:44:32,373 --> 00:44:37,086
I see.
That's why your sister moved to the back of the bus in Hamamatsu.

568
00:44:38,398 --> 00:44:39,438
But if that's the case.

569
00:44:40,113 --> 00:44:45,213
Your sister, her companion, and someone who knew them both boarded the bus.

570
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:47,754
A bit too coincidental, don't you think?

571
00:44:48,177 --> 00:44:51,504
But the coincidence is real right now.

572
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,587
Let's get that woman and find out what his alibi is.

573
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:00,019
Tell me.

574
00:45:02,134 --> 00:45:04,601
It's Christmas.
Don't tell me you've forgotten.

575
00:45:06,257 --> 00:45:09,071
If MADAM gets to know, I won't be able to stay in here.

576
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:10,541
I won't be able to do my sewing.

577
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:12,268
We won't tell anyone.

578
00:45:13,351 --> 00:45:15,684
Just answer if you were with Tsurumaki on Christmas Eve.

579
00:45:17,261 --> 00:45:18,374
I went to Atami.

580
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:19,769
With him.

581
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,849
You sure?
Where were you at 12?

582
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,055
Take a bath at the inn in Atami

583
00:45:25,616 --> 00:45:28,149
I'll check with the inn and see if you're lying.

584
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:29,336
Trust me.

585
00:45:37,275 --> 00:45:37,835
Go home.

586
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:41,699
I won't tell Madam, so please don't tell Tsurumaki about today.

587
00:45:42,127 --> 00:45:44,235
I'm sorry about that.

588
00:45:44,836 --> 00:45:45,842
I'll take this.

589
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:47,167
Here you go.

590
00:45:49,859 --> 00:45:50,805
All clean.

591
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,852
How is this possible?

592
00:45:53,385 --> 00:45:53,985
Wait a minute.

593
00:45:54,857 --> 00:46:05,357
You, me and Tsuneko Saito's family were the only ones who knew she was coming to Tokyo on the Hakuba train yesterday.

594
00:46:05,757 --> 00:46:06,510
There's someone else.

595
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:07,117
Who?

596
00:46:07,921 --> 00:46:08,841
The woman in the apartment.

597
00:46:25,524 --> 00:46:26,538
Did something happen?

598
00:46:26,563 --> 00:46:29,017
The caretaker's aunt was killed in a car accident.

599
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:29,630
Hello?

600
00:46:29,786 --> 00:46:33,642
She got pulled over right out front.

601
00:46:34,191 --> 00:46:35,118
It was around 5:00.

602
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,777
I was just passing by and I got the license plate number right.

603
00:46:39,269 --> 00:46:44,096
But the police found that the car with the license plate number was driving somewhere else.

604
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:47,357
It was a fake license plate number.

605
00:46:47,664 --> 00:46:49,171
Police said same.

606
00:46:49,196 --> 00:46:50,717
Do you remember what the car looked like?

607
00:46:50,958 --> 00:46:53,125
Polices asked me same things.

608
00:46:53,771 --> 00:46:57,311
It was dark, and I only focused the number.

609
00:46:58,261 --> 00:47:00,074
But I'm pretty sure it was a mid-size car.

610
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:02,484
It was a mid-size car.
Are you sure?

611
00:47:03,301 --> 00:47:05,468
Everyone else who saw it said so, too.

612
00:47:06,361 --> 00:47:07,821
Are you newspaper reporter?

613
00:47:08,141 --> 00:47:08,627
Yes.

614
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,811
Wanna take a rest?

615
00:47:12,705 --> 00:47:17,591
Find someone who can drive a mid-size car.

616
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:21,503
Saito Tsuneko and my sis must have been taken there in that car.

617
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,733
The hit-and-run on the woman in the apartment must have been planned by that guy.

618
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:28,571
Why would he do that?

619
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:32,545
He used her as a spy to protect himself.

620
00:47:33,254 --> 00:47:38,134
But he already killed TSUNEKO.
When there was nothing she could do, he killed her to keep her quiet.

621
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,104
Yoshii

622
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,217
Ah, seniority.

623
00:47:51,364 --> 00:47:53,004
Do you have something to be guilty about?

624
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,024
No, I don't.

625
00:47:55,607 --> 00:47:57,887
The Weekly Times circulation seems to be up quite a bit.

626
00:47:58,231 --> 00:47:59,997
Well, thanks to you.

627
00:48:01,285 --> 00:48:04,405
You've got a reputation for being the top story there.

628
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,406
Machida,Sorry I'm late.

629
00:48:15,616 --> 00:48:20,163
I found out.
Nishiaki is the only one of the four who has a medium size car.

630
00:48:20,446 --> 00:48:21,346
How about Seno?

631
00:48:21,626 --> 00:48:23,673
He doesn't have one.
He's got a license, though.

632
00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:27,103
So Dr. Nishiaki is the one who pulled you over yesterday?

633
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:29,287
That's the thing...
Strange thing is...

634
00:48:30,314 --> 00:48:33,048
Nishiaki took a cab to and from the hospital yesterday.

635
00:48:35,431 --> 00:48:37,104
He left the hospital in a cab around 4:00.

636
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:41,023
The woman was attracted to a mid-size car with a fake license plate around 5:00.

637
00:48:42,295 --> 00:48:46,509
So somewhere along the way, he got out of the cab and into his own car.
It all fits together.

638
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:53,343
I'll see what I can find out about his behavior yesterday.

639
00:48:57,516 --> 00:49:00,283
I didn't expect you to ask me out.

640
00:49:01,003 --> 00:49:03,403
I was frustrated about my job.

641
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:06,788
I'm sure with someone like you, I'll be able to find some relief and distraction.

642
00:49:07,615 --> 00:49:09,121
You've changed.

643
00:49:09,278 --> 00:49:12,471
No way.
I kind of want to be a punk.

644
00:49:12,944 --> 00:49:15,624
No, no, no. I'm saying you're becoming more and more attractive.

645
00:49:16,406 --> 00:49:17,093
Hello?

646
00:49:21,868 --> 00:49:23,268
Fake culturist.

647
00:49:27,905 --> 00:49:29,251
You have to be careful with that guy.

648
00:49:33,252 --> 00:49:35,112
He's play boy.

649
00:49:35,845 --> 00:49:36,618
No way.

650
00:49:39,455 --> 00:49:40,655
No, it's true.

651
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:44,352
There was a woman who came to me, asking me to take care of his children.

652
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:51,359
The one who was close to you.

653
00:49:53,682 --> 00:49:57,515
You mean she was my sister?

654
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:06,252
No way.

655
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,196
He just loved your sis.

656
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:14,275
Machida didn't think much of your sister.

657
00:50:17,026 --> 00:50:20,166
Sachiko, I want you to dance with you.

658
00:50:20,973 --> 00:50:21,639
Kasahara,.

659
00:50:24,117 --> 00:50:27,051
Go home.
I'll send you.

660
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:35,458
Nice car, isn't it?

661
00:50:36,398 --> 00:50:37,538
First time?

662
00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:44,050
It's a domestic car.
If I had the money, I'd trade it in for a foreign car.

663
00:50:44,482 --> 00:50:46,849
You drove this car to the hospital every day?

664
00:50:47,522 --> 00:50:47,935
Yeah.

665
00:50:53,872 --> 00:50:56,166
Yesterday you took a cab.

666
00:50:57,901 --> 00:51:00,941
Yesterday my car broke down and I had to take it to the shop.

667
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:07,202
He's my family repairman.
If I leave it there for half a day, they'll take care of it.

668
00:51:09,576 --> 00:51:10,570
Is it in your neighborhood?

669
00:51:33,356 --> 00:51:34,023
Damn it.

670
00:51:34,663 --> 00:51:35,369
What's wrong?

671
00:51:36,313 --> 00:51:37,233
It's broken.

672
00:52:38,687 --> 00:52:39,400
It's fixed.

673
00:52:53,365 --> 00:52:56,518
I've been having a little trouble with the engine lately.

674
00:53:06,522 --> 00:53:07,162
Well..

675
00:53:09,788 --> 00:53:11,755
It's still early. Let's go have a drink somewhere.

676
00:53:12,521 --> 00:53:14,695
I know good restaurant.

677
00:53:16,558 --> 00:53:17,411
But..

678
00:53:19,484 --> 00:53:19,984
Let's go.

679
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:33,269
Let go of me!

680
00:53:35,209 --> 00:53:36,516
Stop it!

681
00:53:38,076 --> 00:53:38,996
Let go of me!

682
00:53:40,113 --> 00:53:41,267
Let go of me!

683
00:54:00,244 --> 00:54:01,844
I'd hate for you to get the wrong idea.

684
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:03,984
I think I was joking too much.

685
00:54:04,643 --> 00:54:07,283
You think I'm the kind of person who would seriously do something like this?

686
00:54:30,448 --> 00:54:31,041
Good night.

687
00:55:06,709 --> 00:55:07,349
Who?

688
00:55:07,879 --> 00:55:08,492
It's me.

689
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:10,725
Oh right.

690
00:55:14,871 --> 00:55:17,424
It's late.
Where did you go?

691
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,124
At a nightclub.
Yokohama.

692
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:19,924
That's it?

693
00:55:20,184 --> 00:55:20,824
Yes, that's it.

694
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:23,518
Nishiaki was so scary.

695
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:24,925
What's wrong with Nishiaki?

696
00:55:26,395 --> 00:55:27,322
Tell me.

697
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,451
I didn't tell you.
No matter what happens, I have a mascot.

698
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:35,620
Damn it..Nishiaki.
Did you find out anything about the car?

699
00:55:36,272 --> 00:55:39,959
He said his car broke down yesterday and he had to take it to the shop.

700
00:55:40,112 --> 00:55:40,493
where?

701
00:55:40,872 --> 00:55:43,038
I heard it's his family's shop.

702
00:55:44,144 --> 00:55:44,910
Wanna come in?

703
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,837
Anyway, I'm gonna check out this factory.

704
00:55:47,114 --> 00:55:47,954
Now?

705
00:55:48,253 --> 00:55:49,627
The sooner the better.

706
00:55:58,826 --> 00:56:00,499
No repairs.

707
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:02,927
I hope you didn't take it to another factory.

708
00:56:02,952 --> 00:56:03,841
Not at all.

709
00:56:04,438 --> 00:56:07,318
We've been repairing Dr. Nishiaki's car for a long time.

710
00:56:07,805 --> 00:56:11,925
One phone call and we're on the road.
We've been taking care of him for a long time.

711
00:56:12,624 --> 00:56:13,184
I see.

712
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:41,497
Seno loved your sister.

713
00:56:42,237 --> 00:56:46,703
Machida didn't think much of your sister.

714
01:00:29,066 --> 01:00:29,713
Who?

715
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,799
The door was open.

716
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,833
I'm the caretaker now, coming on behalf of my sister.

717
01:01:04,267 --> 01:01:05,020
That car.

718
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:09,359
You said it looked like Nishiaki's car?

719
01:01:10,588 --> 01:01:12,971
It was too dark to make out but..

720
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,830
Then I guess Nishiaki is the culprit after all.

721
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:18,986
It was a complete lie that he went to his family's repair shop.

722
01:01:19,549 --> 01:01:25,330
But your sister was murdered on Christmas Eve.
Dr. Nishiaki has an alibi, right?

723
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:32,424
That's the thing. I spent all night last night trying to figure it out.
The final conclusion I came to was that he had an accomplice.

724
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:35,359
Who's an accomplice?

725
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:40,108
Someone who can drive.
I mean, Seno.

726
01:01:40,632 --> 01:01:44,968
Well, they don't seem to get along.
They're always bad-mouthing each other.

727
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:49,335
That's what's suspicious.
They could be making it look that way, but behind the scenes, they could be holding hands.

728
01:01:49,773 --> 01:01:52,999
But then again, maybe Seno has an alibi for Eve.

729
01:01:53,406 --> 01:01:54,609
At a nightclub in Yokohama.

730
01:01:54,945 --> 01:01:59,281
That's very suspicious.
Nightclubs are very crowded on Christmas Eve.

731
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,351
If he leaves in the middle of the night and comes back after the crime, he won't even know what he's doing.

732
01:02:03,859 --> 01:02:04,702
I see

733
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:06,906
I think I need to go to the hostess and check it out.

734
01:02:07,898 --> 01:02:11,827
Anyway, I'll see you soon.
I'm trying to set a trap for Nishiaki.

735
01:02:12,218 --> 01:02:12,929
What kind?

736
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:14,515
I'll tell you at the Lunar.

737
01:02:15,085 --> 01:02:17,054
Okay.
I'll be right there.

738
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:20,992
300,000yen.

739
01:02:21,476 --> 01:02:24,187
Machida's severance pay
She can't get it if she's killed.

740
01:02:24,249 --> 01:02:25,617
It's big money.

741
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:27,999
If you quit tomorrow, I'll pay you a severance package.

742
01:02:28,382 --> 01:02:29,015
Oh.

743
01:02:31,054 --> 01:02:32,281
Send here.

744
01:02:32,421 --> 01:02:34,101
Her mom?

745
01:02:34,367 --> 01:02:37,304
Kotani Village, Tsuru District, Yamanashi Prefecture

746
01:02:37,499 --> 01:02:40,234
If it's okay, I'll deliver it.

747
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:41,827
I'll see her son.

748
01:02:42,288 --> 01:02:42,718
Where?

749
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:43,835
Right there.

750
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,100
That's funny.

751
01:02:45,187 --> 01:02:45,726
for what?

752
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:49,609
Machida's brother isn't in Tokyo.

753
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:52,132
Yes, he is.
He's in the Times Weekly.

754
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:54,726
What?
He's still in high school.

755
01:02:55,023 --> 01:02:56,827
Eh?
High school student?

756
01:03:00,288 --> 01:03:02,999
You saw him yesterday, too.

757
01:03:03,718 --> 01:03:04,226
Where?

758
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,757
At Tsukihashi Park.

759
01:03:07,523 --> 01:03:11,609
Masami Yoshii, my junior in college.

760
01:03:11,836 --> 01:03:12,578
Oh.

761
01:03:17,246 --> 01:03:18,316
Why not?

762
01:03:18,456 --> 01:03:19,151
I won't.

763
01:03:20,301 --> 01:03:22,082
Even the case isn't closed yet.

764
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:25,246
It's just the weekly one.
I'm having a hard time finding a top story.

765
01:03:25,707 --> 01:03:26,660
Write the article.

766
01:03:28,824 --> 01:03:31,191
You pretended to be Ms. Machida's brother for our work.

767
01:03:31,738 --> 01:03:33,418
Yeah,but.

768
01:03:34,972 --> 01:03:36,519
But now I regret it.

769
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:39,879
Hey, you love her?

770
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:45,519
That's not so you.

771
01:03:47,402 --> 01:03:48,191
Write the article.

772
01:03:51,004 --> 01:03:52,105
Write the article.

773
01:03:52,215 --> 01:03:54,285
Is this fine?

774
01:03:55,051 --> 01:03:56,855
You made it.
I'm going out for a minute.

775
01:03:58,886 --> 01:03:59,551
Yoshii

776
01:04:00,386 --> 01:04:02,590
He really love her.

777
01:04:04,582 --> 01:04:06,496
This is a picture of the trap I'm going to set for Nishiaki.

778
01:04:06,879 --> 01:04:10,191
I asked the photo department to get one that looks as much like Nishiaki's car as possible.

779
01:04:10,894 --> 01:04:14,035
Seno and Sajiki's daughter is getting married tonight.

780
01:04:14,269 --> 01:04:17,004
After that, they're going on their honeymoon to France!

781
01:04:17,761 --> 01:04:19,785
I'm going to finish this today, whatever it takes.

782
01:04:20,746 --> 01:04:21,496
What's wrong?

783
01:04:22,722 --> 01:04:23,527
Yoshii

784
01:04:27,418 --> 01:04:28,722
You are terrible.

785
01:04:28,918 --> 01:04:33,324
You impersonated Ms. Machida's brother to reassure me.
You were trying to get material for the top story.

786
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:39,097
I was so stupid.
I can't believe I was fooled by you.

787
01:04:40,805 --> 01:04:41,477
No, it's not.

788
01:04:41,962 --> 01:04:43,032
What do you mean by that?

789
01:04:44,212 --> 01:04:45,454
I love you.

790
01:04:47,532 --> 01:04:48,610
Don't say that.

791
01:04:49,602 --> 01:04:52,712
I'm here to tell you that I won't be indebted to you.

792
01:04:52,737 --> 01:04:53,852
I'm sorry I deceived you.

793
01:04:54,321 --> 01:04:55,454
But what I just said is true.

794
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:58,329
That's enough.

795
01:04:58,354 --> 01:04:59,384
Wait a minute.

796
01:05:01,344 --> 01:05:03,227
Don't worry.
I have this.

797
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:06,344
Bring this.

798
01:05:58,129 --> 01:05:59,403
Sorry I'm late

799
01:06:00,723 --> 01:06:02,395
I was busy preparing to go to the wedding.

800
01:06:02,762 --> 01:06:04,114
For seno's wedding?

801
01:06:05,294 --> 01:06:05,950
Yes

802
01:06:08,476 --> 01:06:11,687
I thought you wouldn't go

803
01:06:13,266 --> 01:06:13,836
Why?

804
01:06:15,007 --> 01:06:18,609
Because you don't like him,Seno

805
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:24,922
But It can't be helped.

806
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:26,797
What do you want?

807
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:31,592
Yes.

808
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:33,139
Tell me.

809
01:06:34,764 --> 01:06:37,827
Actually, sir, there's something I'd like to show you.

810
01:06:42,977 --> 01:06:44,837
It's a picture of a car.

811
01:06:45,524 --> 01:06:46,790
It's a car that got pulled over.

812
01:06:49,081 --> 01:06:52,964
The photographer in my apartment took it by accident.

813
01:07:02,093 --> 01:07:05,976
But why did you come to me to show me these pictures?

814
01:07:08,083 --> 01:07:12,115
I thought it looked a lot like your car.

815
01:07:14,005 --> 01:07:17,294
The photographer says he's going to report it to the police.

816
01:07:18,896 --> 01:07:21,505
He's very funny.

817
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:53,184
I get it.

818
01:07:54,192 --> 01:07:57,200
By the way, what time did you leave Seno on Christmas Eve?

819
01:07:57,739 --> 01:08:01,856
Oh, I don't know... a little after 10:00, maybe 1:00.

820
01:08:02,114 --> 01:08:02,887
10:00 to 1:00.

821
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:07,961
I was wondering if he'd gone home, and then I found him passed out on the couch.

822
01:08:08,765 --> 01:08:13,586
He told me I thought you were gone, I was sad.

823
01:08:15,093 --> 01:08:17,797
He pretested to be cool.

824
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:24,687
I even went to a hotel with him, but that was stupid.

825
01:08:24,899 --> 01:08:26,516
You left here together?

826
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:27,375
Yes.

827
01:08:28,102 --> 01:08:29,953
Well, didn't SENO have a car at that time?

828
01:08:30,070 --> 01:08:32,477
Yes he had.
Nishiaki's car.

829
01:08:34,546 --> 01:08:37,531
Nishiaki's car?
You sure?

830
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:04,734
I would like to propose a toast to the prosperity of the bride and groom and their families.

831
01:09:05,086 --> 01:09:06,820
Congratulation!

832
01:09:10,878 --> 01:09:13,097
Mr. Nishiaki is on the phone.

833
01:09:13,511 --> 01:09:14,550
Again?

834
01:09:16,613 --> 01:09:18,339
He's kind of rude.

835
01:09:23,303 --> 01:09:25,538
Still no end to the party?

836
01:09:26,522 --> 01:09:28,358
I need you.

837
01:09:29,092 --> 01:09:31,022
No way.
I'm a doctor.

838
01:09:32,130 --> 01:09:35,528
Hello, please... I made your marriage happen, just like we promised.

839
01:09:37,911 --> 01:09:39,880
I'm about to give her another dose of anesthesia.

840
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:46,462
Oh you're still here.

841
01:09:47,298 --> 01:09:49,189
I have to work.

842
01:09:49,939 --> 01:09:51,298
Hello?

843
01:09:52,962 --> 01:09:54,267
Sachiko Kasahara?

844
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:56,329
From Yoshii

845
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,790
She's not here

846
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:02,310
She hasn't visited us.

847
01:10:02,779 --> 01:10:04,123
See you.

848
01:10:05,752 --> 01:10:08,025
I'm about to leave, so you guys should go, too.

849
01:10:22,771 --> 01:10:24,045
You look so nice.

850
01:10:26,014 --> 01:10:27,975
Oh Dr.Nishiaki

851
01:10:38,031 --> 01:10:38,796
Seno

852
01:10:40,062 --> 01:10:44,734
I'm so glad you took the time to come.

853
01:10:44,759 --> 01:10:46,249
You're in danger.

854
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:47,937
Congratulations.

855
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:53,203
Anesthesia is working?

856
01:10:54,835 --> 01:10:55,804
Anyway, please come right away

857
01:10:56,781 --> 01:10:58,656
Just wait until this party's over.

858
01:10:58,820 --> 01:10:59,601


859
01:10:59,671 --> 01:11:01,562
Another an hour.

860
01:11:01,938 --> 01:11:03,626
We don't have time.

861
01:11:08,313 --> 01:11:09,837
Please think about the location.

862
01:11:10,595 --> 01:11:14,603
This is a big wedding for me.
You know as well as I do.

863
01:11:15,126 --> 01:11:19,423
You've already forgotten how much I helped you with that wedding.

864
01:11:21,916 --> 01:11:24,073
Are you saying I didn't return the favor?

865
01:11:30,685 --> 01:11:34,904
When NOBUKO died in a bus accident in Hamamatsu
And now you're just cringing.

866
01:11:35,545 --> 01:11:38,904
What do you think would have happened if I hadn't happened to get on that bus and help you?

867
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:41,935
It would have been best if you hadn't gotten on that bus.

868
01:11:42,529 --> 01:11:46,209
It would have been best if you hadn't stolen Madam Sajiki's eye and gone on that trip with that woman.

869
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:53,787
I killed three women because of you.

870
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:54,490
No.

871
01:11:55,927 --> 01:11:58,052
You killed Tomoe Machida for your convenience.

872
01:12:00,513 --> 01:12:04,545
That's true.
But to get Sajiki's daughter and his fortune, I had no choice.

873
01:12:05,146 --> 01:12:07,099
She was going to tell Reiko about our relationship.

874
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:09,521
And in the middle of a Christmas party too!

875
01:12:11,091 --> 01:12:13,576
But tomorrow I'm flying to Paris with Reiko.

876
01:12:13,873 --> 01:12:16,271
So everything's fine with me.

877
01:12:16,296 --> 01:12:17,498
Then what about me?

878
01:12:17,763 --> 01:12:18,560
Up to you.

879
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,802
By my calculations, we don't owe each other anything.

880
01:12:26,498 --> 01:12:28,810
What if you solve the problem alone?

881
01:12:33,006 --> 01:12:36,053
If I could do it on my own, I wouldn't have asked for your help in the first place.

882
01:12:37,201 --> 01:12:41,318
Yes, you can. Make the best of what you do.

883
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:45,076
You know, you could do her face and dig in the ocean.

884
01:12:46,412 --> 01:12:49,498
So you want me to kill people too?

885
01:12:56,018 --> 01:13:00,565
In today's society, people are victims unless they're perpetrators.

886
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:04,952
You're a coward.

887
01:13:06,202 --> 01:13:08,319
Crime is an intellectual sport.

888
01:13:09,132 --> 01:13:13,921
If you're cool, you're on your feet, and you're seemingly careless, you won't get caught.

889
01:13:15,132 --> 01:13:16,569
You're a lunatic.

890
01:13:18,046 --> 01:13:18,780
You're crazy.

891
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:22,647
That's right.
But it's the only way to survive.

892
01:13:23,515 --> 01:13:24,226
Dr.

893
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,101
Why don't you get these white hands dirty once in a while?

894
01:13:30,991 --> 01:13:33,976
Hey, do me a favor, please.

895
01:13:35,093 --> 01:13:37,069
Please, please, come with me.

896
01:13:37,874 --> 01:13:40,718
I don't know what to do.

897
01:13:45,316 --> 01:13:46,605
You're in trouble, aren't you?

898
01:14:37,237 --> 01:14:38,534
Where's Seno?

899
01:14:38,972 --> 01:14:40,948
I think he went out.

900
01:14:41,097 --> 01:14:42,019
Went where?

901
01:14:42,448 --> 01:14:44,019
I heard he went to see Dr. Nishiaki.

902
01:14:44,339 --> 01:14:45,136
Nishiaki?

903
01:15:20,246 --> 01:15:24,918
This is the police, please say your location.

904
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:28,371
Hello?

905
01:15:28,988 --> 01:15:30,293
Hello?

906
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:56,484
She's not here.

907
01:16:01,390 --> 01:16:03,038
Hello?

908
01:16:03,554 --> 01:16:04,890
please say your location.

909
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:06,741
This is the police

910
01:16:06,766 --> 01:16:08,233
She's calling the police.

911
01:16:08,468 --> 01:16:11,335
This is the police, please say your location.

912
01:16:16,592 --> 01:16:19,670
You think these pictures are proof?
She tricked you.

913
01:16:51,198 --> 01:16:53,003
She doesn't need any more plastic surgery.

914
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:57,011
She had a severe nervous breakdown and crashed accidentally.

915
01:16:57,573 --> 01:17:00,081
We tried to save her, but we couldn't get to her in time.

916
01:17:02,644 --> 01:17:05,589
You're good at making people die in accidents, aren't you?

917
01:17:05,636 --> 01:17:07,331
Go around there now.

918
01:17:07,683 --> 01:17:08,339
But..

919
01:17:08,402 --> 01:17:11,613
I'm leaving my wedding to come here.

920
01:17:12,242 --> 01:17:13,695
I can go back now.

921
01:17:13,758 --> 01:17:14,461
Seno.

922
01:17:14,523 --> 01:17:16,398
Okay, so you're just gonna get out of here?

923
01:17:17,609 --> 01:17:20,203
You ambush her at that window over there and push her down.

924
01:18:45,170 --> 01:18:46,631
Hurry up.

925
01:19:21,182 --> 01:19:22,353
Speed up.

926
01:20:51,032 --> 01:20:52,407
Where's Sachiko?

927
01:21:00,236 --> 01:21:00,907
Sachiko!

928
01:21:18,025 --> 01:21:18,986
Yoshii!

929
01:21:24,834 --> 01:21:25,537
Sachiko!

930
01:22:49,166 --> 01:22:49,869
Sachiko!

931
01:22:54,414 --> 01:22:55,023
Sachiko!

932
01:22:56,461 --> 01:22:59,922
Sachiko! Sachiko!

933
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:04,180
Sachiko!

934
01:23:16,446 --> 01:23:25,039
Sister. I finally found the person who abandoned her sister and ran away from the scene of the bus accident in Hamamatsu.

935
01:23:26,173 --> 01:23:30,001
Dr. Nishiaki
I think I hate Dr. Nishiaki

936
01:23:31,204 --> 01:23:33,219
But I hate Seno even more

937
01:23:34,938 --> 01:23:40,728
Seno, who happened to be on the bus, got Dr. Nishiaki to arrange a meeting with Sajiki's daughter on the condition that Dr. Nishiaki,

938
01:23:41,454 --> 01:23:53,297
who was in a panic after the accident, would abandon my sister and not tell anyone, and killed Tomoe Machida, who got in the way of the meeting.

939
01:23:55,657 --> 01:23:59,142
On the other hand, he used the woman in the apartment as a spy.

940
01:24:00,321 --> 01:24:06,313
Tsuneko Saito was the only witness who knew that my sister and Dr. Nishiaki were on the bus together.

941
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:12,078
When he found out Tsuneko Saito was coming to Tokyo, he killed her.

942
01:24:13,188 --> 01:24:17,298
He also killed the woman who maintain in the apartment

943
01:24:19,821 --> 01:24:22,712
But then Seno died too.

944
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:28,594
He left his bride on their honeymoon in Europe.

945
01:24:46,016 --> 01:24:48,165
I'm here to apology you.

946
01:24:48,649 --> 01:24:49,985
I cheated on you, and I'm really sorry.

947
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,181
That's why I didn't write about this case.

948
01:25:08,019 --> 01:25:09,714
Then see you.

949
01:25:43,888 --> 01:25:52,973
THE END

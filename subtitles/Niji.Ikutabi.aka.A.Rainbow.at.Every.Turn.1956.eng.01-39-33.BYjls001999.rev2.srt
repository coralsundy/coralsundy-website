00:00:18,673 --> 00:00:24,485
(A rainbow at every turn)

3
00:01:59,176 --> 00:02:00,293
Hi, Little boy

4
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,504
No rainbows today, huh?

5
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:07,172
I passed by here in the evening soon after she was born

6
00:02:08,938 --> 00:02:13,149
It was winter, but suddenly there was a rainbow over the lake

7
00:02:13,477 --> 00:02:16,258
Oh really?
Rainbows in winter are rare

8
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,352
Yes true

9
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:21,235
The colors of that rainbow were like spring and summer

10
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,891
When I see a big rainbow, I feel like happiness is coming

11
00:02:27,953 --> 00:02:29,922
I showed it to this kid

12
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:31,719
He didn't seem to get it

13
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:33,250
Because he's a little boy

14
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:35,422
How old is he now?

15
00:02:35,649 --> 00:02:37,633
He is 5 month plus a few months years old

16
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:45,107
Would you excuse me a minute?

17
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:48,022
I will take care of him

18
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:49,537
Can you?
Thank you very much

19
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:06,756
Chu chu

20
00:03:14,264 --> 00:03:15,561
Thank you very much

21
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,279
Shall I do it for you?

22
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,475
I'm used to it

23
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:24,107
ooh-la-la!

24
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,889
His mother is in Kyoto now

25
00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:32,279
Have you ever taken care of a baby?

26
00:03:32,857 --> 00:03:33,748
No No

27
00:03:34,084 --> 00:03:35,787
But I learnt it at school

28
00:03:35,818 --> 00:03:36,897
Oh! at school!

29
00:03:36,982 --> 00:03:37,662
Yes

30
00:03:37,772 --> 00:03:41,139
Someone'll make you do it soon enough

31
00:03:45,045 --> 00:03:47,311
Well..Are you living in Tokyo?

32
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,654
Yes,
I had some business in Kyoto

33
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:51,287
I'm on the way to return to Tokyo

34
00:03:51,334 --> 00:03:52,881
I see, I understand

35
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:56,147
Oh,lalalala

36
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:19,513
Stop here

37
00:04:31,318 --> 00:04:32,482
Why did you go to Kyoto?

38
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:36,334
I went to see my friend who got married

39
00:04:36,623 --> 00:04:37,475
You are lying

40
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:38,881
I'm not lying

41
00:04:40,897 --> 00:04:42,529
But the real purpose is different

42
00:04:46,826 --> 00:04:50,045
The sister that you went to look for, did you find her in Kyoto?

43
00:04:51,787 --> 00:04:52,732
Did you find her?

44
00:04:56,115 --> 00:04:56,748
I see

45
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,990
I think She's lucky you didn't find her

46
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,334
Sister,
Our father does not know about it at all

47
00:05:04,803 --> 00:05:06,639
Asako went to Kyoto with that in mind

48
00:05:07,803 --> 00:05:08,826
I can't say

49
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:14,451
Our father has a good intuition

50
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:16,451
I also have a good intuition

51
00:05:16,772 --> 00:05:17,982
What did our father say?

52
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,037
He didn't say anything

53
00:05:24,647 --> 00:05:26,951
For whom did you go to Kyoto?

54
00:05:27,529 --> 00:05:28,647
For our father?

55
00:05:29,154 --> 00:05:30,623
Or for us?

56
00:05:31,615 --> 00:05:33,553
For your mother? or

57
00:05:34,654 --> 00:05:35,842
For the sister in Kyoto?

58
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:39,287
It's not for anyone

59
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:42,217
So did you feel morally responsible?

60
00:05:43,748 --> 00:05:45,162
If not, For your viewing pleasure?

61
00:05:47,834 --> 00:05:49,107
I don't know...

62
00:05:53,029 --> 00:05:57,561
Before Asako's mother died, she was worried about her child in Kyoto

63
00:05:58,904 --> 00:06:00,178
So you went there?

64
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:03,514
But..

65
00:06:03,553 --> 00:06:06,350
I'm sorry I need to leave now

66
00:06:23,037 --> 00:06:24,240
Sister

67
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:25,681
I have a favor of you.

68
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:29,178
Please don't make a distinction
between Asako's mother and your mother.

69
00:06:30,326 --> 00:06:33,178
Asako's mother is your mother now

70
00:06:33,607 --> 00:06:34,607
I hope you understand

71
00:06:35,584 --> 00:06:36,420
Right

72
00:06:37,404 --> 00:06:39,357
She was very nice

73
00:06:41,388 --> 00:06:44,513
I had a mother of my own who committed suicide

74
00:06:44,764 --> 00:06:46,006
There is no choice to say it

75
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:51,412
Don't cry.
You don't have to cry

76
00:06:58,248 --> 00:07:00,022
You are sweet,Asako

77
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,006
You went to see her because you have feelings for your sister in Kyoto

78
00:07:06,178 --> 00:07:07,139
But Asako

79
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,225
Before your mother die

80
00:07:10,873 --> 00:07:14,802
I don't know if she meant it when she acknowledged the girl from Kyoto as our sister

81
00:07:15,154 --> 00:07:16,826
Why do you think so?

82
00:07:17,068 --> 00:07:18,639
She's dying, herself...

83
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:21,607
Asako's mother is miserable

84
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:24,928
If the Kyoto kid comes into our house later

85
00:07:25,436 --> 00:07:28,436
She might as well acknowledge the Kyoto girl while she's still alive, she thought.

86
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,584
You are going to Kyoto for your mother

87
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:33,959
You are stupid

88
00:07:34,014 --> 00:07:34,881
Sister...

89
00:07:36,506 --> 00:07:39,904
Everyone has their own way of life and their own environment

90
00:07:41,678 --> 00:07:45,818
I think the girl in Kyoto will be confused when they enter the house

91
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,334
Brothers are just the beginning of strangers

92
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:50,225
Let her do whatever she wants

93
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:34,787
Go home!
Go home!

94
00:08:55,115 --> 00:08:56,772
Why aren't you waiting in your usual spot?

95
00:08:57,295 --> 00:08:58,936
I had been waiting you there

96
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:02,232
Why are you snooping around my house like a thief?

97
00:09:02,443 --> 00:09:05,264
Because you often skip our dates

98
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:25,365
Our father's car

99
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,600
Where is Momoko?

100
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:10,334
She has just let house

101
00:10:16,764 --> 00:10:17,873
Oh welcome home

102
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:18,857
When did you back home?

103
00:10:18,936 --> 00:10:19,654
Just now

104
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,943
Mmmm..
You must be tired

105
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,147
Not at all

106
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,537
Shall we prepare the meal?

107
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:28,811
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

108
00:10:28,967 --> 00:10:29,459
Not yet

109
00:10:29,951 --> 00:10:31,881
I bought your favorite boiled rice soaked with tea

110
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:33,787
Really? Thank you very much

111
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:37,608
Please prepare a meal for him

112
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,561
Yes

113
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,170
Where are the hangers,Sumi?

114
00:10:57,295 --> 00:10:58,615
Was it cold in Kyoto?

115
00:10:58,904 --> 00:11:00,553
It was not cold much

116
00:11:04,475 --> 00:11:07,412
Miss, the spinach is cooked

117
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,381
Did you drain it well?

118
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:09,107
Yes

119
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:10,849
Okay, you can cut up the bacon.

120
00:11:10,982 --> 00:11:11,373
Yes

121
00:11:11,544 --> 00:11:13,982
Then open a can of olive oil.

122
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:14,779
Yes

123
00:11:18,029 --> 00:11:20,154
It's inconvenient and annoying without Asako

124
00:11:21,334 --> 00:11:22,217
For a meal

125
00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:24,803
and for everything

126
00:11:25,427 --> 00:11:27,091
Because my mother taught me

127
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:33,537
I'm thinking of going to Atami for work in a couple of days

128
00:11:34,553 --> 00:11:35,303
Do you want to come with me?

129
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,295
Yes I would like to go

130
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,483
Shall we ask my sister too?

131
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:39,826
Um

132
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,381
But...I wonder she wants to come

133
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,194
It's a tragedy to be thrown away after just a few peeks at your house

134
00:11:58,264 --> 00:11:59,404
What are you talking about?

135
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:02,561
You're just passing through me

136
00:12:03,045 --> 00:12:04,279
Passing through you?

137
00:12:05,748 --> 00:12:07,811
You will like another student girl soon

138
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:10,889
No way, you think so?

139
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,561
I'd have to die if you left me

140
00:12:14,014 --> 00:12:14,740
I'm serious

141
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,584
You don't have to say that

142
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:19,678
So You don't get angry anymore?
Please promise it

143
00:12:21,537 --> 00:12:23,256
Ok, I do

144
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:24,951
In exchange, I'll take you to Hakone

145
00:12:24,983 --> 00:12:25,678
Really?

146
00:12:26,404 --> 00:12:28,108
I'm glad,You really should take me to Hakone

147
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,240
It's quiet here

148
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,311
Yes

149
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,553
You changed your mind suddenly

150
00:12:54,717 --> 00:12:56,194
You preferred Hakone to Atami

151
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:59,029
I think this change would have been better

152
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:03,662
Excuse me

153
00:13:05,725 --> 00:13:07,045
The bath is ready

154
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,686
Oh, Thank you

155
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:11,498
Shall we take a bath?

156
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:13,287
I'm shy

157
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:14,951
You will be shy with me?

158
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:15,912
Because

159
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:18,514
Then I will take first

160
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:19,225
I see

161
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,069
Ah...

162
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:34,076
Father

163
00:13:35,498 --> 00:13:36,998
I will take a bath with you too

164
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,233
I will go for a walk there

165
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:50,131
Yes

166
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:56,928
I will take care of your luggage

167
00:13:58,576 --> 00:13:59,225
Take care

168
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:07,639
Ah...

169
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:11,365
I'm going to build Asako a house

170
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:13,631
My house?

171
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:16,201
I will live there alone?

172
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,295
Is there anyone you want to live with yet?

173
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:22,967
I have no idea

174
00:14:25,334 --> 00:14:27,076
If so, you can live there alone

175
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:30,670
A home worthy of your beauty

176
00:14:32,084 --> 00:14:33,584
I'm an architect

177
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,936
Even in a small house for my daughter

178
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:39,186
I want to leave you a house, like will testament

179
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:41,897
A house like a will?

180
00:14:42,092 --> 00:14:43,568
I don't like it

181
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:46,639
But listen to me

182
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:51,475
Recently I feel something...

183
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:56,404
I feel the fate of architects in the age of atomic and hydrogen bombs

184
00:14:56,514 --> 00:14:59,334
You say the loneliest things

185
00:15:00,912 --> 00:15:03,850
To build a house for my daughter...

186
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:06,561
It's fatherly love

187
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:08,545
or rather I should say

188
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:10,694
It's a fatherly touch

189
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:12,880
Yes, It's a fatherly touch

190
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:39,670
Hey you

191
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:40,295
Yes

192
00:15:40,819 --> 00:15:42,553
Where is the best view spot?

193
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,584
It's a badminton court there

194
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:54,397
Father

195
00:15:55,842 --> 00:15:56,233
Hum?

196
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,170
You have three houses to build for your daughters

197
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,030
What?

198
00:16:06,913 --> 00:16:07,983
For my sister

199
00:16:08,491 --> 00:16:09,999
For my younger sister in Kyoto too

200
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,084
Oh

201
00:16:33,772 --> 00:16:34,303
Asako

202
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:36,905
Don't go there, let's go back

203
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:49,499
You know what?

204
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:54,272
My sister thinks we've been to Atami

205
00:16:55,131 --> 00:16:57,811
It's like we're doing something wrong and hiding

206
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,538
What are you going to do with my sister?

207
00:17:02,444 --> 00:17:04,225
Can you just leave my sister alone?

208
00:17:06,413 --> 00:17:07,538
Is that OK with you?

209
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:43,874
Thanks for the meal

210
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:44,709
Not at all

211
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:18,913
She seduced such a young boy

212
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:23,741
I don't understand what she thinks

213
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:30,569
Find the real wound in Momoko's mind

214
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,280
Find the real wound ?

215
00:18:34,163 --> 00:18:37,006
I don't know what to do too

216
00:18:40,123 --> 00:18:44,153
She would only confide in her real mother,I think...

217
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,053
Who knows?

218
00:18:47,069 --> 00:18:49,991
And She's strong-minded

219
00:18:52,459 --> 00:18:53,264
But father....

220
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:54,116
Asako

221
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:59,256
I've been in love twice, married once

222
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:02,686
Momoko is the child of my first love

223
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:06,030
You are the child of the woman I married.

224
00:19:08,029 --> 00:19:10,499
And the last child, Wakako

225
00:19:21,991 --> 00:19:25,249
Am I dirty man?

226
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,866
Anyway each my daughters are very beautiful

227
00:19:36,147 --> 00:19:38,944
Whenever I see you,I forget my sins

228
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:42,975
That's just another selfish thought on my part

229
00:19:46,827 --> 00:19:49,467
I took Momoko in despite your mother's presence

230
00:19:50,194 --> 00:19:52,186
Because Momoko's mother committed suicide

231
00:19:54,475 --> 00:19:59,326
That may broke Momoko's heart

232
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,280
You have 3 children

233
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:07,850
In truth, I'm the only one

234
00:20:08,694 --> 00:20:09,436
You are right

235
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:11,608
If so...

236
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:14,084
I feel sorry for you

237
00:20:14,764 --> 00:20:15,717
But,Asako

238
00:20:16,866 --> 00:20:20,217
Children and parents cannot be separated from each other

239
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,936
I would like to see my sister in Kyoto

240
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:28,069
I want you to meet her

241
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,202
But Momoko won't allow it

242
00:20:32,506 --> 00:20:33,631
Want to eat some?

243
00:20:40,249 --> 00:20:43,522
Who would take out a motorboat this late in the day?

244
00:21:05,905 --> 00:21:08,295
Close the door,Asako.
It's cold

245
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:19,702
What's wrong?

246
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,655
I thought that person was my sister

247
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:28,217
But I don't see the boat. I only can hear the sound

248
00:21:28,842 --> 00:21:30,928
Are you thinking the same thing?

249
00:21:31,514 --> 00:21:32,811
The same thing?

250
00:21:34,155 --> 00:21:37,967
Momoko plays with dangerous men because she has bad experiences in the past

251
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,577
Momoko resents that you're a filthy man

252
00:21:43,053 --> 00:21:43,639
So

253
00:21:43,664 --> 00:21:44,686
It might be so

254
00:21:45,514 --> 00:21:48,350
Whenever I've been watching her behavior

255
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:52,663
I think she's willing to try to kill herself.

256
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:53,803
kill herself?

257
00:22:03,475 --> 00:22:06,452
Father,Not only for my sister but

258
00:22:07,405 --> 00:22:11,366
What if I and my sister in Kyoto are three like my sister?

259
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,186
Such as Suicide, hating their father,

260
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,717
being far away from you

261
00:22:17,772 --> 00:22:19,241
What are you talking about,Asako?

262
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:21,920
I don't like our current situation

263
00:22:22,194 --> 00:22:23,045
We are sister

264
00:22:23,186 --> 00:22:25,569
I want everyone to be happy

265
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:09,225
Oh,I wondered who you were, but I guess you're Mizuhara.

266
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:10,295
It's been a whole

267
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:12,334
You came here all of a sudden

268
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:13,006
Yes

269
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:14,600
Anyway Please come in

270
00:23:27,077 --> 00:23:28,381
Nothing has changed here

271
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,420
No way

272
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:31,858
I don't take much care of it

273
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,420
You came here alone tonight?

274
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:37,452
No.
We came here with my daughters

275
00:23:37,592 --> 00:23:39,202
I see.
That would be nice

276
00:23:40,499 --> 00:23:43,217
There is someone who wants to build a tea house here

277
00:23:43,342 --> 00:23:44,834
I came here for the work

278
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:45,717
I see

279
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:54,905
In fact, I wanted to meet Kikue

280
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,108
What?

281
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:58,428
I used to come here with her

282
00:23:59,022 --> 00:23:59,788
I see

283
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,116
I once came holding a child

284
00:24:02,553 --> 00:24:03,334
I see

285
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,819
She left me during the war.

286
00:24:07,233 --> 00:24:08,889
She sometime comes here?

287
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,952
Yes maybe

288
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:14,116
I see.
I'll serve tea when she comes in

289
00:24:14,294 --> 00:24:14,818
Yes

290
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:19,405
I'll go get Oku-san
She'll be happy to know that Mr. Mizuhara is here.

291
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,459
Are you still sleeping?

292
00:24:42,701 --> 00:24:43,678
Asako

293
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:46,178
I feel sleepy

294
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:48,053
Do you know what time is it now?

295
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:50,022
It's past ten o'clock

296
00:24:50,647 --> 00:24:52,389
Oh really?

297
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:54,217
Where is father?

298
00:24:54,413 --> 00:24:55,702
He's already gone

299
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:56,592
To where?

300
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,748
I have no idea

301
00:24:58,702 --> 00:25:00,811
There are two tickets on the desk

302
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:01,905
I see

303
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,155
This?

304
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:09,124
Yes

305
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,561
He meant for us to watch it

306
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:22,139
You know what?

307
00:25:23,366 --> 00:25:26,374
I think he's making arrangements to meet your sister in Kyoto

308
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,288
I don't like it

309
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:31,147
You came all this way to be with me, didn't you?

310
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:34,928
I refused to go to atami last time. so this time I have no choice to come here

311
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:38,733
But I want to meet her, so you should meet her

312
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:43,116
Hey Asako

313
00:25:44,741 --> 00:25:46,999
My father wants us to meet your sister in Kyoto

314
00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:49,725
He doesn't want you to meet her, he wants me to meet her

315
00:25:51,741 --> 00:25:53,663
You have come here to meet her before

316
00:25:53,912 --> 00:25:55,623
Our father does not care

317
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,397
I don't want to acknowledge her as my sister

318
00:25:58,834 --> 00:26:00,616
So I think he'd really like me to have her

319
00:26:01,624 --> 00:26:03,014
It's complicated

320
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,967
It's complicated... for your mother?

321
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,365
Because your mother was a stepmother?

322
00:26:08,888 --> 00:26:09,716
She was not

323
00:26:10,733 --> 00:26:13,459
Asako's mother was very good to me

324
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:15,810
How many times I should tell you about it?

325
00:26:16,532 --> 00:26:20,946
The reason our father took us to here is not for meeting my sister

326
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:22,868
He feels lonely if he comes here alone

327
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,579
Why our father feels lonely?

328
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:26,337
Because you are..

329
00:26:26,563 --> 00:26:27,954
Me what?

330
00:26:29,204 --> 00:26:32,188
I don't know what he is doing in Kyoto

331
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,040
(singing)

332
00:26:56,056 --> 00:26:57,954
How old are you right now?

333
00:26:58,259 --> 00:26:59,063
I have no idea

334
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:00,954
Ha?

335
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,897
In this temple,There is no cherry blossom

336
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:06,592
Hahaha

337
00:27:07,272 --> 00:27:10,131
Cherry blossoms mess up the garden

338
00:27:11,373 --> 00:27:13,670
I see you've lost your hearing

339
00:27:13,967 --> 00:27:15,357
It's true

340
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:21,404
Cherry blossoms are too flashy for a temple

341
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,717
It's strange for a priest to pay to plant cherry trees

342
00:27:34,295 --> 00:27:35,311
She has come

343
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:35,912
Thanks

344
00:27:36,084 --> 00:27:38,951
I put her through to the sitting room

345
00:27:39,014 --> 00:27:39,529
Thanks

346
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,662
It's nice to see you again

347
00:28:01,553 --> 00:28:02,357
It's nice to see you again too

348
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,397
It's been a long time

349
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,061
When was the last time you saw me?

350
00:28:19,803 --> 00:28:21,561
It was long time ago

351
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:26,216
In this morning,I have come here while our daughter was sleeping

352
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,342
Oh I see.
That sounds tough

353
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:31,311
You have not changed yourself anything

354
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:33,865
No way,
I'm so tired from all the hard work

355
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:35,795
I've aged

356
00:28:37,178 --> 00:28:40,084
Actually, my wife was dead last year

357
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:41,982
I'm sorry to hear it

358
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:45,670
Of the three parents of my daughter, you are the only one still alive

359
00:28:47,201 --> 00:28:50,357
You are the only ex-wife who reminds me

360
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:53,326
Don't be so lonely

361
00:28:54,678 --> 00:28:57,240
It's not what I want you to think of me when I'm dead

362
00:28:58,381 --> 00:29:00,795
I regret that I should have been better to you

363
00:29:01,967 --> 00:29:02,959
I feel regret

364
00:29:03,131 --> 00:29:05,006
What are you saying?

365
00:29:05,342 --> 00:29:07,193
You'll have to tell that to your wife

366
00:29:08,107 --> 00:29:09,662
You took care of me well

367
00:29:10,756 --> 00:29:12,803
I never forgot what you did to me

368
00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:17,967
Would you like something to eat?

369
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:19,576
I'll take it

370
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:40,389
Wakako must have grown up

371
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:42,725
Thanks to you

372
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,529
I'm being raised with great care

373
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:48,053
I should have brought her

374
00:29:50,984 --> 00:29:51,671
If...

375
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:56,163
If I ever met her, though, I wouldn't be her father

376
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:57,859
No way

377
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:02,077
She hasn't forgotten how to be pretty.

378
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,132
She said she was going to see my father.

379
00:30:06,015 --> 00:30:09,460
She said this with tears in her eyes

380
00:30:10,499 --> 00:30:12,015
I escorted her out

381
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:14,226
I see

382
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:26,882
Ah

383
00:31:36,507 --> 00:31:37,241
I will take care

384
00:31:43,132 --> 00:31:43,733
Hi

385
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:52,857
I met you on the train before

386
00:31:54,054 --> 00:31:55,561
Ummm...

387
00:31:55,819 --> 00:31:57,733
Olalalala

388
00:32:20,554 --> 00:32:22,264
Oh,take your seat

389
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:23,295
Never mind

390
00:32:23,491 --> 00:32:24,460
Please sit down

391
00:32:24,804 --> 00:32:25,342
Please

392
00:32:28,178 --> 00:32:29,827
You take your baby everywhere

393
00:32:29,852 --> 00:32:32,796
I'm not going to show the dance to the baby

394
00:32:33,108 --> 00:32:34,710
I'm going to show the dance to this babysitter

395
00:32:35,014 --> 00:32:36,194
Hmmmm

396
00:32:39,647 --> 00:32:40,522
She is my sister

397
00:32:41,764 --> 00:32:43,077
This is Mr.Otani

398
00:32:43,483 --> 00:32:44,335
Nice to meet you

399
00:32:44,475 --> 00:32:48,374
The other day, I had your sister care for my baby

400
00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:49,771
I see

401
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,304
What a cute baby

402
00:32:58,741 --> 00:32:59,929
Cute ears

403
00:33:00,718 --> 00:33:03,241
Her ears look a lot like her mother

404
00:33:03,624 --> 00:33:04,554
Oh I see

405
00:33:04,788 --> 00:33:08,530
This babysitter is my mother's sister

406
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:10,929
She takes care my baby better

407
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:14,788
Older sister isn't kind everywhere

408
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:17,936
No..No at all

409
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:25,538
By the way how do you know my name is Otani?

410
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:28,233
Did I give you my business card?

411
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,054
No

412
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:31,460
I saw your name tag on your luggage at the time

413
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,405
Is that so

414
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,796
Asako

415
00:33:42,702 --> 00:33:44,749
This is our father's business card by the way

416
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:45,546
Thanks

417
00:33:46,811 --> 00:33:48,257
Mr. Tsuneo Mizuhara...

418
00:33:49,733 --> 00:33:52,796
Ah! That famous architect

419
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:04,248
If I remember currently..his office is around here

420
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:05,069
Yes

421
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,843
Waka-Chan! Waka-Chan!

422
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:26,436
What happened?

423
00:34:27,374 --> 00:34:28,210
I have no idea

424
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,217
Hmmm

425
00:35:09,061 --> 00:35:11,983
(Baby crying)

426
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:28,733
Actually Asako was last year...

427
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:33,202
She came here to find her sister without asking me and Momoko

428
00:35:33,475 --> 00:35:35,092
Oh I see

429
00:35:36,295 --> 00:35:39,389
I don't think it's just the sentiment of losing her mother

430
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,295
If Wakako knows it, I'm sure she'd glad

431
00:35:43,686 --> 00:35:45,897
I want Asako to meet Wakako at this opportunity

432
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,928
I know Wakako will be glad but..

433
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:51,826
Momoko won't be happy

434
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:15,991
I don't make Wakako feel embarrassed

435
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,202
I will ask her to meet Asako

436
00:36:18,788 --> 00:36:19,936
I would really appreciate it

437
00:36:20,163 --> 00:36:21,920
It's not big deal

438
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,264
This is a souvenir I got from a temple

439
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:27,779
Can you show this to Wakako?

440
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:28,514
Sure

441
00:36:29,038 --> 00:36:31,085
This petals are wonderful

442
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:33,913
I think she will be glad

443
00:36:53,655 --> 00:36:55,139
Did u see our father?

444
00:36:55,624 --> 00:36:58,639
Did you come back without seeing the dance?

445
00:36:59,772 --> 00:37:01,624
Mr.Otani worried about you

446
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,358
Mom

447
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:09,467
Did you come by Kaburenjo?

448
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:13,452
What hell you talk about?
You escaped from there

449
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:15,444
I didn't escape from there

450
00:37:16,077 --> 00:37:19,170
I met my sisters in Tokyo

451
00:37:20,505 --> 00:37:21,209
What?

452
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:24,085
They are so beautiful girls

453
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:28,475
Oh really? then why did you escaped from there?

454
00:37:28,881 --> 00:37:31,913
I don't know..but it was hard to stay

455
00:37:32,038 --> 00:37:34,608
Both of them are your sister

456
00:37:35,288 --> 00:37:36,624
But I...

457
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:39,178
If I said too them I am your younger sister at that time

458
00:37:39,272 --> 00:37:41,670
I felt that I would have the same fate as my mother

459
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:44,467
What do you mean,Wakako?

460
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:49,335
She was always reluctant

461
00:37:51,038 --> 00:37:54,436
My mother always gave up something

462
00:37:55,217 --> 00:37:57,749
But I don't like it

463
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:02,100
If my sisters really want to meet me,I'd happy to meet them

464
00:38:02,928 --> 00:38:04,577
Otherwise I don't want to meet them

465
00:38:10,608 --> 00:38:14,178
Your father gives this to you

466
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:20,655
Let me display it in my room

467
00:38:20,905 --> 00:38:21,960
Is that so?

468
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:06,006
Our father has gone again?

469
00:39:06,194 --> 00:39:07,592
Yes he has gone to Nara

470
00:39:08,006 --> 00:39:10,733
He said there is something helpful for work

471
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:11,944
I see

472
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:16,663
I got tired with Kyoto

473
00:39:18,694 --> 00:39:19,756
Excuse me

474
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:20,677
Yes

475
00:39:22,092 --> 00:39:23,608
Someone visit you

476
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:24,655
Who?

477
00:39:25,217 --> 00:39:27,702
His name is Natsuji Aoki

478
00:39:31,444 --> 00:39:32,483
Who is he?

479
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,803
He is a student

480
00:39:36,405 --> 00:39:38,631
I invited him to room over there

481
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:39,725
I see

482
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,538
Do you know him?

483
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:49,780
Do you know?

484
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:54,835
I was successfully deceived by my father

485
00:39:56,506 --> 00:39:57,475
I should have come here

486
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:07,717
What's wrong with you?

487
00:40:15,881 --> 00:40:17,170
I finally get it

488
00:40:17,913 --> 00:40:22,311
The person who asked my father to design a tea room is Aoki's father

489
00:40:22,991 --> 00:40:23,404
Eh?

490
00:40:24,499 --> 00:40:27,897
Natsuji is Keita's younger brother

491
00:40:30,522 --> 00:40:32,389
Kita is my ex boyfriend

492
00:40:33,366 --> 00:40:35,085
He died in Okinawa at WW2

493
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:36,311
Oh...

494
00:40:38,577 --> 00:40:41,210
You didn't know anything because you were small

495
00:40:42,592 --> 00:40:45,319
My dad doesn't even know the truth

496
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,397
Please go to see him ,Asako

497
00:40:48,624 --> 00:40:49,475
Why me?

498
00:40:49,553 --> 00:40:50,889
Please talk with him

499
00:40:51,303 --> 00:40:53,210
But what should we talk about...

500
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,264
It is ok if you just listen to him

501
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:56,241
Ok?

502
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:57,366
What you will do then?

503
00:40:58,639 --> 00:40:59,936
I will go after calming down

504
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:25,936
Momoko!

505
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,303
Recently I'm always like this!

506
00:42:30,029 --> 00:42:31,350
When I'm up for it

507
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,178
I felt hot all over my body

508
00:42:33,608 --> 00:42:35,037
I suddenly feel like drawing my sword

509
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,772
People trust their lives to this sword

510
00:42:40,544 --> 00:42:41,209
I feel ridiculous

511
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:45,662
The room upstairs, that's the problem

512
00:43:02,467 --> 00:43:03,881
I'm a suicide bomber

513
00:43:05,272 --> 00:43:07,194
I am ready to die

514
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:10,592
I remember my baby sometimes

515
00:43:11,764 --> 00:43:12,608
Why is that?

516
00:43:14,647 --> 00:43:19,084
Babies don't know the horror and terror of war

517
00:43:21,576 --> 00:43:23,358
I sometime think of it

518
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,522
Am I a coward?

519
00:43:28,529 --> 00:43:29,865
I know how you feel

520
00:43:35,897 --> 00:43:36,834
Momoko-san

521
00:43:37,928 --> 00:43:39,858
I want to see your face under the light

522
00:44:16,076 --> 00:44:16,764
Ah...

523
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:30,983
Momoko-san!

524
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:33,670
I want to mold your breasts

525
00:44:33,975 --> 00:44:34,490
What?

526
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,944
I'll make a bowl out of a mold of your breasts

527
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:40,358
I want to finish my last life drinking from that bowl

528
00:44:40,444 --> 00:44:42,944
No! No I don't like it!

529
00:44:43,069 --> 00:44:44,951
With the bowl of your breast

530
00:44:45,912 --> 00:44:47,295
I want to finish my life

531
00:44:47,381 --> 00:44:49,139
No! No I don't like it!

532
00:44:49,506 --> 00:44:51,310
Momoko-san! May I?

533
00:45:33,686 --> 00:45:35,717
She is my sister.
This is Natsuji-san

534
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:41,209
Natsuji's father invited us over for dinner.

535
00:45:41,959 --> 00:45:43,287
Are you university student now?

536
00:45:43,514 --> 00:45:45,420
Yes. and I will graduate next year

537
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:49,795
His school is in Tokyo, but He is here for his graduation thesis

538
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:50,920
I see

539
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:54,920
So you're the same age as your dead brother

540
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,209
Yes

541
00:45:57,295 --> 00:45:59,342
You two are very much alike

542
00:45:59,897 --> 00:46:00,842
It's like copycat!

543
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:02,935
Yes, many people say that

544
00:46:06,256 --> 00:46:08,576
Is that your brother's hat?

545
00:46:08,889 --> 00:46:09,678
Yes

546
00:46:10,201 --> 00:46:13,858
It was small at first, but gradually it became just right

547
00:46:43,295 --> 00:46:43,944
I've made it!

548
00:46:48,201 --> 00:46:49,717
Look, Momoko-san!

549
00:47:15,617 --> 00:47:16,961
Ah, so delicious!

550
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:21,484
Your blood runs through here

551
00:47:23,094 --> 00:47:23,984
Please drink it

552
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:25,274
No...

553
00:47:28,953 --> 00:47:30,281
Do not be hesitate

554
00:47:37,227 --> 00:47:38,844
Oh! it's cold!

555
00:48:04,703 --> 00:48:06,297
(air-raid alarm)

556
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:09,938
(air-raid alarm)

557
00:48:10,117 --> 00:48:11,133
Oh..eh!!

558
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:13,008
Stop it!

559
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,336
No!

560
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:17,133
(air-raid alarm)

561
00:49:20,281 --> 00:49:22,094
(air-raid alarm)

562
00:49:30,609 --> 00:49:33,320
Oh my god, You are bad

563
00:49:38,789 --> 00:49:41,484
Maybe it would have been better if we'd broken up instead of letting this happen

564
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:44,586
I find other women much more interesting

565
00:49:49,656 --> 00:49:50,796
I have to leave now

566
00:49:52,336 --> 00:49:53,524
Wait!

567
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:08,195
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

568
00:50:12,836 --> 00:50:14,203
Because I feel disappointed

569
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:20,750
You are terrible

570
00:50:23,063 --> 00:50:23,977
I'm going

571
00:50:24,031 --> 00:50:24,844
Please

572
00:50:26,250 --> 00:50:27,484
Tell me the season

573
00:50:29,703 --> 00:50:30,680
Please

574
00:50:32,258 --> 00:50:32,836
Because

575
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,758
You are not a woman!

576
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:41,149
Keita-san!

577
00:51:09,625 --> 00:51:11,086
So What you will do?

578
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,664
If you want to refuse, you have to tell Natsuji-san

579
00:51:17,797 --> 00:51:19,000
I will visit you

580
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:20,547
I feel at ease

581
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:28,141
Thank you for visiting us

582
00:51:35,867 --> 00:51:36,625
Momoko-san

583
00:51:37,649 --> 00:51:40,766
I'm sorry I didn't inform you of Keita's death in battle

584
00:51:42,297 --> 00:51:44,336
I didn't inform you on purpose

585
00:51:45,133 --> 00:51:48,805
I'm sorry for his loss too

586
00:51:52,688 --> 00:51:57,274
I just wanted to thank you for what you did for Keita

587
00:51:57,984 --> 00:51:59,531
and I wanted to apologize too

588
00:52:00,766 --> 00:52:02,930
It's between him and me.

589
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:08,352
I don't want anyone else to apologize to me

590
00:52:09,305 --> 00:52:11,297
Yes you are right..but

591
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:14,788
Anyway

592
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:17,734
I want to say thank you, and apologize to you

593
00:52:18,555 --> 00:52:23,305
I will forget everything

594
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,563
It is not easy to forget for me

595
00:52:28,781 --> 00:52:31,219
Ok, Let's forget it

596
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:39,289
After Keita's death, I'll miss you

597
00:52:40,711 --> 00:52:43,109
I can't wait to see you

598
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,141
I was going to kill myself

599
00:52:47,836 --> 00:52:49,078
Oh, sister...

600
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:53,102
At that time,I had just been drafted too

601
00:52:53,695 --> 00:52:56,586
I had cyanide from the factory, just in case

602
00:52:57,945 --> 00:52:59,141
I took it

603
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:00,469
When was it?

604
00:53:01,844 --> 00:53:03,446
But it was sugar

605
00:53:05,133 --> 00:53:07,532
Before I knew it, the contents had been replaced

606
00:53:08,446 --> 00:53:10,719
Your mother replaced it for me

607
00:53:12,563 --> 00:53:14,821
When I felt it tasted sweet

608
00:53:15,368 --> 00:53:16,680
 It hit me

609
00:53:18,016 --> 00:53:20,336
My mother killed herself with cyanide

610
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:25,899
I thanks to Asako's mother

611
00:53:28,516 --> 00:53:31,001
I've always found human life to be a strange thing.

612
00:53:32,235 --> 00:53:34,657
And then I'll never think of dying again

613
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,297
I licked the sugar with the intention of dying

614
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,469
Your mother probably doesn't know either

615
00:53:44,204 --> 00:53:45,954
No one knows

616
00:53:46,594 --> 00:53:48,110
They don't know anything

617
00:53:49,649 --> 00:53:52,094
Why you planned to suicide?

618
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:57,008
Even if I talk to you, I won't forget

619
00:54:06,422 --> 00:54:06,727
Um

620
00:54:26,156 --> 00:54:27,226
Please take your seat

621
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:37,555
You were supposed to come here

622
00:54:37,852 --> 00:54:38,360
Um

623
00:54:54,258 --> 00:54:55,501
What's wrong,Aoki-san?

624
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:58,290
You're very quiet

625
00:54:58,493 --> 00:55:00,820
We have been tried of waiting for  you

626
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:04,001
Please drink

627
00:55:17,250 --> 00:55:18,297
What are you looking at?

628
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:19,868
Pictures of Katsuyagi-kyu

629
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,821
Natsuji-san who was there with me took photos of me

630
00:55:25,102 --> 00:55:28,360
Asako read the book as soon as she got home

631
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,891
Asako is always like that

632
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:35,251
You listen to Mozart, then studies Mozart's history

633
00:55:35,454 --> 00:55:36,602
Yes..No choice

634
00:55:36,969 --> 00:55:39,188
What if you investigate him after you're married?

635
00:55:39,446 --> 00:55:40,352
You are too bad

636
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:45,352
I'm sure you talk with Natsuji-san about me

637
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:47,196
Because Sister..

638
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:48,727
Even though you don't know anything

639
00:55:49,149 --> 00:55:51,422
I never talk about you badly

640
00:55:51,836 --> 00:55:53,149
I don't like the attitude!

641
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:55,938
You always pretend to be nice

642
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:01,657
I'm sure Natsuji-san pretend to talk nicely about his brother

643
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:04,328
That's not true

644
00:56:09,266 --> 00:56:10,501
You know what,Asako?

645
00:56:11,446 --> 00:56:15,626
If you're going to talk about me, you should talk about the world

646
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:20,180
I am..

647
00:56:21,915 --> 00:56:26,008
If Keita had died in that war, I wish I had killed him

648
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:29,899
I hated Keita

649
00:56:31,626 --> 00:56:32,563
My mother also...

650
00:56:33,493 --> 00:56:36,180
If she wanted to kill herself, she should have killed my father

651
00:56:37,001 --> 00:56:37,641
Why you say that?

652
00:56:37,821 --> 00:56:39,805
She probably hates my father

653
00:56:40,743 --> 00:56:42,915
That's for my mother?

654
00:56:45,415 --> 00:56:46,860
Because you are sweet

655
00:56:47,758 --> 00:56:52,579
You try to help the sister in Kyoto,me and out father

656
00:56:52,618 --> 00:56:53,743
I didn't mean I try to help you

657
00:56:54,094 --> 00:56:56,101
I've never had a cheeky thought like that

658
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,563
You know what,Asako?

659
00:56:59,243 --> 00:57:01,360
Shall I tell you that you don't know?

660
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:02,524
What is that?

661
00:57:02,876 --> 00:57:04,258
About my health

662
00:57:04,493 --> 00:57:05,415
Tell me

663
00:57:05,594 --> 00:57:08,055
I want to know all about you

664
00:57:08,594 --> 00:57:09,688
Let me pass this time

665
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:11,032
You are too bad

666
00:57:11,057 --> 00:57:12,352
You tried to say..

667
00:57:12,422 --> 00:57:13,805
It's not your business

668
00:57:15,016 --> 00:57:17,969
By the way You will invite Natuji-san Tomorrow, Sunday?

669
00:57:18,118 --> 00:57:19,868
Our father said that

670
00:57:20,243 --> 00:57:21,602
But I won't be here

671
00:57:21,719 --> 00:57:22,469
Why?

672
00:57:23,165 --> 00:57:24,641
I will go on trip a few days

673
00:57:26,407 --> 00:57:28,313
You should take care of him

674
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:31,282
Why do you always pick on me?

675
00:57:32,102 --> 00:57:33,258
I probably envy you

676
00:57:34,047 --> 00:57:37,399
You should meet Natsuji-san then remind of Keita-san

677
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:39,782
What the hell you talk about?

678
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:43,024
Natsuji-san wants to know about you

679
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,297
He worries about you

680
00:57:46,399 --> 00:57:49,235
I don't want your sympathy

681
00:57:49,813 --> 00:57:51,797
I don't like the way you talk to me

682
00:57:52,219 --> 00:57:53,094
Sister

683
00:57:53,227 --> 00:57:53,969
What?

684
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:58,227
So You will go to Hakone

685
00:57:59,422 --> 00:58:01,665
Then you will drive motorboat at night

686
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:39,836
Why you don't look at me?

687
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:41,641
Sister

688
00:58:44,149 --> 00:58:47,735
I worry as if I get after your back

689
00:58:48,922 --> 00:58:50,727
You act like a girl

690
00:58:52,071 --> 00:58:54,516
Because you read book all the time

691
00:58:55,633 --> 00:58:57,446
I've been arguing with Asako

692
00:58:57,852 --> 00:58:58,571
Is that so?

693
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,891
Hey Miya-Chan, for us

694
00:59:03,782 --> 00:59:05,727
There is a sister in Kyoto too

695
00:59:06,532 --> 00:59:08,594
But each sister has different mother

696
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,109
That doesn't matter right now

697
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:12,805
That does matter for me

698
00:59:13,501 --> 00:59:15,766
That doesn't matter for you and me

699
00:59:21,946 --> 00:59:22,461
I feel pain

700
00:59:24,172 --> 00:59:25,360
I feel pain

701
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:27,672
What are you going to do to me?

702
00:59:28,704 --> 00:59:30,001
Give me your necklace

703
00:59:30,641 --> 00:59:31,290
What you will use it for

704
00:59:34,196 --> 00:59:37,235
I will kill myself with that necklace if you left me

705
00:59:39,258 --> 00:59:40,180
Miya-Chan

706
00:59:41,352 --> 00:59:44,266
Have you ever lived in resistance to your own sadness?

707
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:47,290
sadness?

708
00:59:49,454 --> 00:59:51,696
It's sad that You and me do like this

709
00:59:52,196 --> 00:59:54,485
Oh..you are kidding

710
00:59:54,969 --> 00:59:56,805
You try to make me sad

711
00:59:57,266 --> 00:59:58,594
You try to dump me

712
01:00:00,719 --> 01:00:01,946
You are annoying baby

713
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:05,102
I give you

714
01:00:10,829 --> 01:00:13,024
You mean I have to suicide

715
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:16,993
I got letter from your mother

716
01:00:18,743 --> 01:00:21,352
She said in the letter Please make him back home

717
01:00:22,883 --> 01:00:23,626
What the hell

718
01:00:25,547 --> 01:00:29,992
I probably forget that you have your parents

719
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,274
I'm sorry for that

720
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:02,415
I will be bad boy if you dump me

721
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,157
I will play with girl as many as possible

722
01:01:06,032 --> 01:01:08,297
But I am better than you

723
01:01:10,321 --> 01:01:11,844
Yes you are good boy

724
01:01:15,266 --> 01:01:16,344
I won't leave from you!

725
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:19,586
You may be a demon, but you can't leave me

726
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:21,165
Can you dump me?

727
01:01:21,415 --> 01:01:22,993
You will dump me?

728
01:01:23,782 --> 01:01:24,235
Ah...

729
01:01:32,001 --> 01:01:34,009
This is the only thing left of my brother

730
01:01:35,774 --> 01:01:38,759
Did Keita do this kind of plasterwork?

731
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:41,977
Yes,My father used to make tea bowls from clay

732
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:44,595
He made it by imitation

733
01:01:46,251 --> 01:01:49,595
But What is this shape?

734
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,837
You will know if you ask to Momoko

735
01:01:54,751 --> 01:01:56,876
She always talk with Asako

736
01:01:57,454 --> 01:01:59,493
As his brother, I feel responsible for him

737
01:01:59,915 --> 01:02:02,501
I feel responsible for Momoko too

738
01:02:06,196 --> 01:02:07,453
Sorry for keeping you wait

739
01:02:07,532 --> 01:02:08,188
Not at all

740
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,680
You know what,Asako?

741
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,845
I think...

742
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:30,266
Momoko is afraid of normal love

743
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:33,321
She's rebelling against it

744
01:02:34,587 --> 01:02:36,048
My brother abused her

745
01:02:38,001 --> 01:02:39,579
And my brother was dead

746
01:02:40,157 --> 01:02:42,548
So She's fighting the ghost of my brother

747
01:02:43,766 --> 01:02:44,555
In her mind

748
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,696
So She doesn't want to see you because you're just like your brother.

749
01:02:48,790 --> 01:02:49,704
I think so

750
01:02:50,282 --> 01:02:52,602
But How bad he did to her?

751
01:02:52,712 --> 01:02:53,845
I don't know that

752
01:02:54,305 --> 01:02:56,360
Because Momoko never talk about that

753
01:02:58,759 --> 01:02:59,735
You know what,Asako?

754
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:02,845
Whenever I see you, we always talk about Momoko

755
01:03:03,712 --> 01:03:07,774
I'm glad because you think of my sister very much

756
01:03:08,477 --> 01:03:11,509
But we should talk about us at least

757
01:03:11,837 --> 01:03:13,610
That's true.  It must be fun

758
01:03:16,493 --> 01:03:17,626
What's wrong?

759
01:03:17,673 --> 01:03:18,790
I'm ok

760
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:19,970
Let's go back

761
01:03:57,016 --> 01:03:57,766
I'm back

762
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,961
Welcome back

763
01:03:59,399 --> 01:04:00,595
It's cold

764
01:04:01,782 --> 01:04:02,868
It's warm today

765
01:04:03,251 --> 01:04:04,845
I feel a chill

766
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:09,055
Good evening

767
01:04:09,259 --> 01:04:09,813
Welcome

768
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:13,751
Oh that's for our dad

769
01:04:14,282 --> 01:04:14,985
Just a passing fancy

770
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:16,595
I will stop when I feel tiered

771
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:21,165
I will have nothing to do if you work like that

772
01:04:22,134 --> 01:04:24,680
It is ok if you play with Natsuji

773
01:04:26,266 --> 01:04:29,977
Natsuji-san will go back to Kyoto for job interview

774
01:04:30,446 --> 01:04:31,375
I see

775
01:04:32,196 --> 01:04:35,415
Asako, Did you show her the item my brother made?

776
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:38,524
Oh.. That is in my father's room

777
01:04:43,938 --> 01:04:45,868
What is that? Natsuji

778
01:04:48,063 --> 01:04:50,329
That is the only thing left of my brother

779
01:04:55,548 --> 01:04:57,540
Natsuji  brought this the other day

780
01:05:01,266 --> 01:05:02,149
Oh..

781
01:05:12,805 --> 01:05:13,766
What's wrong with it?

782
01:05:15,134 --> 01:05:16,235
It arrived from his war zone

783
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,415
Why you have brought this!

784
01:05:22,938 --> 01:05:26,704
I have brought this to ask you what this bowl

785
01:05:28,290 --> 01:05:30,313
Do you know it,Sister?

786
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:33,837
Please tell me what is this

787
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:36,891
My...

788
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,165
That bowl is in the shape of my breasts.

789
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,321
Where was it?

790
01:05:49,602 --> 01:05:51,079
He had it in the war

791
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:52,321
That's not true

792
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,180
That's not true

793
01:05:55,305 --> 01:05:57,087
He died with it in his arms

794
01:05:57,891 --> 01:05:59,602
No....You are lying

795
01:06:00,446 --> 01:06:02,501
He died with it in his arms on his chest

796
01:06:03,977 --> 01:06:06,751
I don't know what happened between you and he

797
01:06:07,587 --> 01:06:09,727
But He loved you!

798
01:06:10,407 --> 01:06:11,759
This is the evidence

799
01:06:11,977 --> 01:06:13,071
I don't believe it

800
01:06:13,259 --> 01:06:14,149
Sister!

801
01:06:14,688 --> 01:06:18,134
Do you know how he felt to look at that?

802
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:19,891
You never know about it!

803
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:20,970
But Momoko-san

804
01:06:21,048 --> 01:06:24,048
Don't defend your brother when you don't know anything about him

805
01:06:24,805 --> 01:06:26,446
You go home!

806
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:33,102
I can't be calm if you are here Because I feel like Keita is here

807
01:06:35,876 --> 01:06:38,055
There is a phone call for you,Momoko

808
01:06:40,399 --> 01:06:41,337
I see

809
01:06:44,868 --> 01:06:45,555
I will go home

810
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:52,423
Hello?

811
01:06:53,188 --> 01:06:54,860
Ah..Miya-Chan

812
01:06:55,852 --> 01:06:58,423
Why you don't want to see me?

813
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:04,345
I feel lonely

814
01:07:04,813 --> 01:07:05,977
That's not good

815
01:07:07,079 --> 01:07:08,086
No, I can't

816
01:07:26,782 --> 01:07:27,696
Where is Natsuji?

817
01:07:31,001 --> 01:07:31,876
He has left

818
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:37,626
Why did you bring that?

819
01:07:38,470 --> 01:07:40,993
Because you loved Keita

820
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:43,227
I didn't love him

821
01:07:44,032 --> 01:07:45,274
I hated him!

822
01:07:47,751 --> 01:07:50,430
I know that's not true.
You said something you didn't mean

823
01:07:51,001 --> 01:07:52,470
I know how you feel

824
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:58,821
You loved him so you let him to mold your breasts

825
01:08:00,477 --> 01:08:02,587
It was probably just happening

826
01:08:03,485 --> 01:08:05,720
Oh my god..you say that...

827
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:10,055
You don't feel sorry for the person who was dead,Sister?

828
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:17,290
I thought you and Keita has been loved each other

829
01:08:18,141 --> 01:08:20,298
But you say like that..

830
01:08:21,149 --> 01:08:21,962
I hate you!

831
01:08:42,524 --> 01:08:44,407
Asako got serious fever.

832
01:08:44,868 --> 01:08:46,649
She's lying in the kitchen

833
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:10,805
Oh Doctor, How is her?

834
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,454
Oh don't worry

835
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:13,462
Thank you very much

836
01:09:13,641 --> 01:09:14,266
Take care

837
01:09:20,993 --> 01:09:22,087
Thanks for taking care of her

838
01:09:22,602 --> 01:09:24,032
I have brought this drawing

839
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:24,962
Thanks

840
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:28,891
Dad,When will that tea house in Kyoto be build?

841
01:09:29,501 --> 01:09:30,923
It will take time more

842
01:09:32,884 --> 01:09:34,884
I wish I could go to Kyoto too

843
01:09:36,141 --> 01:09:37,524
I want to see my sister

844
01:09:38,321 --> 01:09:39,352
You can see her soon

845
01:09:39,970 --> 01:09:43,477
I haven't seen her after you have grown

846
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,610
That's bad

847
01:09:45,899 --> 01:09:47,845
I give up to see her

848
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:55,899
A rainbow in the spring

849
01:09:58,884 --> 01:10:03,305
Dad...Why My sister does not understand how Keita was thinking..

850
01:10:04,579 --> 01:10:07,899
She does not understand men feeling, not only Keita...

851
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:10,462
Time will solve everything

852
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:14,352
You don't have to think about it.
You should get better your health, OK?

853
01:10:17,759 --> 01:10:19,102
Then, I will go home

854
01:10:19,641 --> 01:10:21,001
Thank you for coming to see me

855
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:36,516
Oh You have come here

856
01:10:36,672 --> 01:10:37,672
How is Asako?

857
01:10:37,789 --> 01:10:40,594
She will be fine.
I will go back to my office

858
01:10:49,172 --> 01:10:49,875
How are you?

859
01:10:50,086 --> 01:10:51,188
I'm good

860
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:51,868
Good

861
01:10:52,329 --> 01:10:53,399
I feel at ease

862
01:10:55,024 --> 01:10:58,430
Didn't you inform Natsuji in Kyoto that you were hospitalized?

863
01:10:58,766 --> 01:11:00,500
No..I have not...

864
01:11:01,047 --> 01:11:02,375
You want to see him, don't you?

865
01:11:02,743 --> 01:11:04,743
He is busy with job hunting

866
01:11:06,071 --> 01:11:07,875
You are very thoughtful

867
01:11:09,477 --> 01:11:12,485
OH that drawing is Mirei no haru

868
01:11:12,649 --> 01:11:15,282
Yes, our father has brought this

869
01:11:17,774 --> 01:11:19,977
I have a lot of feelings about this painting

870
01:11:20,391 --> 01:11:20,860
Really?

871
01:11:22,813 --> 01:11:27,813
When my father returned from abroad with this,
I was taken into your home.

872
01:11:28,493 --> 01:11:29,797
Oh really

873
01:11:31,133 --> 01:11:35,063
When did you know our mother is different?

874
01:11:36,422 --> 01:11:38,196
It was when I was 7 years old

875
01:11:40,094 --> 01:11:42,274
You started crying when I told you about it

876
01:11:43,579 --> 01:11:45,157
I felt very sad

877
01:11:46,266 --> 01:11:48,149
I remember it clearly

878
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:53,047
Then you have started to care me very well

879
01:11:54,735 --> 01:11:56,829
I understood how you feel

880
01:11:57,375 --> 01:12:00,969
I sweared I won't betray you in my mind

881
01:12:02,836 --> 01:12:04,368
But I couldn't

882
01:12:06,047 --> 01:12:09,508
I'll apologize to you when I'm dead and in my bones

883
01:12:10,188 --> 01:12:11,586
Oh Sister...

884
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:15,071
Forget about this talking

885
01:12:24,477 --> 01:12:25,297
You know what,Asako?

886
01:12:27,219 --> 01:12:30,297
Shall I continue with what I was saying the other day?

887
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:36,219
Ah! About your health?

888
01:12:37,110 --> 01:12:37,633
Yes

889
01:12:41,704 --> 01:12:43,094
Actually...

890
01:13:16,563 --> 01:13:18,125
It looks like pouring rain tonight

891
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:18,977
Really?

892
01:13:47,938 --> 01:13:50,422
Sister! Sister!

893
01:14:00,938 --> 01:14:03,125
Sister.. I have come here

894
01:14:06,157 --> 01:14:06,813
Come in

895
01:14:33,039 --> 01:14:35,493
Oh cold! cold..

896
01:14:38,164 --> 01:14:39,180
What's wrong?

897
01:14:44,102 --> 01:14:45,047
What do you mean?

898
01:14:47,235 --> 01:14:48,258
You mean say good bye?

899
01:14:53,563 --> 01:14:54,399
I see

900
01:14:57,516 --> 01:14:58,774
OK then let's do it

901
01:15:00,907 --> 01:15:03,633
Please be good man, and go for it

902
01:15:05,047 --> 01:15:06,688
This is my farewell word

903
01:15:07,922 --> 01:15:11,196
But.. I don't want to leave you

904
01:15:12,664 --> 01:15:13,930
Sister!

905
01:15:14,391 --> 01:15:15,204
Miya-Chan!

906
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:17,657
I will die with you

907
01:15:17,860 --> 01:15:19,938
What the hell you do,Miya-Chan!

908
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,102
Stop it

909
01:15:39,750 --> 01:15:42,953
Miya-Chan.. Miya-Chan's

910
01:15:44,805 --> 01:15:47,641
Your baby is in my body

911
01:15:53,047 --> 01:15:54,829
I'm having your baby

912
01:15:58,782 --> 01:16:00,008
You are kidding

913
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:03,024
What is baby?

914
01:16:04,907 --> 01:16:06,391
I'm still baby

915
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:08,711
You are already mature

916
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:12,180
Sister..It's joking,right?

917
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:14,758
It's not joking

918
01:16:16,227 --> 01:16:17,633
He is not my baby!

919
01:16:19,993 --> 01:16:21,282
He is not my baby!

920
01:16:27,735 --> 01:16:31,633
You are probably right.
He is not your baby

921
01:16:32,055 --> 01:16:32,938
My baby

922
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:34,063
No!

923
01:16:34,485 --> 01:16:35,797
You are lair!

924
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:38,555
I won't be cheated

925
01:16:39,532 --> 01:16:40,641
Oh shit!

926
01:16:58,938 --> 01:16:59,985
I'm already back home

927
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:10,680
Momoko...

928
01:17:11,375 --> 01:17:13,243
I need to talk with you tonight

929
01:17:14,414 --> 01:17:15,797
Go to my room and wait for me

930
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:27,133
Welcome back home

931
01:17:30,422 --> 01:17:32,078
Lock up the house and get some rest

932
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:32,782
Thank you!

933
01:17:48,954 --> 01:17:49,852
I see

934
01:17:51,672 --> 01:17:53,743
Keita and You did such a thing

935
01:17:55,993 --> 01:17:57,797
Thanks for telling me ,anyway

936
01:18:08,664 --> 01:18:09,821
But Momoko..

937
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:17,789
I think he said that because he wanted to let you free

938
01:18:21,539 --> 01:18:23,188
What do you mean?

939
01:18:24,274 --> 01:18:26,118
He was going to die soon

940
01:18:26,657 --> 01:18:31,641
He said bad on purpose, then He wanted you to stop loving him

941
01:18:34,579 --> 01:18:38,852
Because he didn't want you to be sad

942
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:44,094
He did it because he loved you so much

943
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:47,727
This is what I think

944
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,860
You're not qualified to decide

945
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:55,414
Why you say that?

946
01:18:57,375 --> 01:19:01,446
If you loved my mother...

947
01:19:02,602 --> 01:19:04,305
She didn't committed suicide

948
01:19:05,633 --> 01:19:06,774
Momoko!

949
01:19:26,868 --> 01:19:27,641
Oh!

950
01:19:27,922 --> 01:19:29,383
I hear you are hospitalized

951
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,266
Who told you?

952
01:19:31,344 --> 01:19:31,907
Momoko

953
01:19:32,329 --> 01:19:33,586
She said to me to see you in this hospital

954
01:19:33,883 --> 01:19:35,969
Oh..My sister is in Kyoto?

955
01:19:36,016 --> 01:19:37,735
Yes, she visited us last night

956
01:19:38,164 --> 01:19:40,977
Oh.. since pouring rain day, she disappeared..

957
01:19:41,758 --> 01:19:43,297
My father worried about her

958
01:19:43,586 --> 01:19:45,883
I made a phone call from Kyoto as soon as she visited us

959
01:19:46,524 --> 01:19:48,391
Your father will be in Kyoto soon

960
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:53,727
She goes to Kyoto.. After all she can't forget about your brother

961
01:19:54,336 --> 01:19:55,508
I think so

962
01:19:56,399 --> 01:20:01,148
I showed her the bowl,I felt she still love him.

963
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:07,079
There was a big trouble after she disappeared

964
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:07,954
What was it?

965
01:20:08,329 --> 01:20:10,906
Well.. Do you remember the little boy called Takemiya?

966
01:20:10,961 --> 01:20:11,680
Yes

967
01:20:12,633 --> 01:20:16,219
He committed suicide in Hakone after he left my sister

968
01:20:17,726 --> 01:20:18,571
Oh really...

969
01:20:19,891 --> 01:20:23,750
I feel sorry for my sister... There are many problem

970
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:51,797
Oh?

971
01:20:56,399 --> 01:20:57,329
What's wrong?

972
01:21:05,274 --> 01:21:06,344
I was looking for you

973
01:21:11,149 --> 01:21:12,664
I shouldn't have come here?

974
01:21:22,555 --> 01:21:27,243
I was writing testamentary letter if I commit suicide

975
01:21:31,016 --> 01:21:32,375
You are distressed

976
01:21:38,555 --> 01:21:41,016
At that night, You got angry and left.

977
01:21:42,336 --> 01:21:43,680
I'm distressed too

978
01:21:53,079 --> 01:21:54,743
Takemiya committed suicide

979
01:21:54,859 --> 01:21:55,492
Eh?

980
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:01,282
He loved you?

981
01:22:02,797 --> 01:22:03,532
No..

982
01:22:07,344 --> 01:22:11,664
Because I'm having his baby..

983
01:22:12,586 --> 01:22:13,047
Hum?

984
01:22:16,766 --> 01:22:17,672
Dad...

985
01:22:19,907 --> 01:22:23,688
My mother wasn't a woman?

986
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:26,391
What the hell you say?

987
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,289
Dad.. I...

988
01:22:33,399 --> 01:22:35,149
While thinking of Keita

989
01:22:37,024 --> 01:22:39,813
I slept with him to be his woman

990
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:43,032
About Miya-Chan, same things

991
01:22:46,930 --> 01:22:48,813
I sew your Kimono dress

992
01:22:49,532 --> 01:22:51,321
I cooked Miso soup for you

993
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:55,149
But the Kimono dress looks ugly

994
01:22:55,563 --> 01:22:57,477
Miso soup I cooked taste bad

995
01:22:59,954 --> 01:23:00,516
I...

996
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:03,297
Your mother was not good at them

997
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:07,461
She gave up on herself and killed herself

998
01:23:08,977 --> 01:23:11,407
In doing so, She thought it would free me

999
01:23:14,086 --> 01:23:16,079
But Momoko...

1000
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:23,125
Affection requires a deep love for each other

1001
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:29,344
Your mother didn't understand me

1002
01:23:31,446 --> 01:23:32,977
About Keita

1003
01:23:33,579 --> 01:23:37,665
You should think of his pure mind deeply

1004
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:43,204
This is the only way how to save you from your suffering

1005
01:23:43,266 --> 01:23:44,266
Stop talking!

1006
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:48,899
You never know what is real love

1007
01:23:52,274 --> 01:23:55,766
Please leave me alone

1008
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:00,196
I see

1009
01:24:02,547 --> 01:24:04,641
There is no words to say

1010
01:24:06,727 --> 01:24:09,016
I don't think I ask you to forgive me

1011
01:24:14,665 --> 01:24:17,915
I will go home without meeting Wakako and her mother

1012
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:23,774
But can you see Keita's dad again?

1013
01:24:34,579 --> 01:24:35,344
Momoko

1014
01:24:36,688 --> 01:24:40,500
I want to read the letter what you write on the train

1015
01:25:13,219 --> 01:25:13,704
Awwww

1016
01:25:15,055 --> 01:25:15,594
Awwww

1017
01:25:18,297 --> 01:25:20,266
Awwwww

1018
01:25:26,985 --> 01:25:28,407
Awwwww

1019
01:25:51,915 --> 01:25:56,821
I talked with your father all over the night

1020
01:25:57,454 --> 01:25:59,063
Anyway take your seat

1021
01:26:04,391 --> 01:26:07,610
I probably will remind you

1022
01:26:10,906 --> 01:26:12,757
I'm crazy about my kids

1023
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:19,102
I want to feel same with Mr.Mizuhara about Keita

1024
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:25,532
In a short... It was bad that Keita was dead

1025
01:26:27,141 --> 01:26:30,024
People says when you die, all is forgiven

1026
01:26:30,907 --> 01:26:31,727
Momoko

1027
01:26:33,297 --> 01:26:36,313
Let's make the dead person pay for their sins

1028
01:26:38,868 --> 01:26:40,540
Your mother too

1029
01:26:42,141 --> 01:26:44,790
I don't know why she commuted suicide

1030
01:26:47,196 --> 01:26:48,079
Momoko

1031
01:26:49,805 --> 01:26:54,797
If I forgive those who died,and I'm going to hell.
What do you think about this?

1032
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:03,508
People who live must forgive people who was dead

1033
01:27:04,407 --> 01:27:06,415
You're going to have a baby so

1034
01:27:09,735 --> 01:27:13,016
You know about I am having baby

1035
01:27:17,415 --> 01:27:21,032
Mr. Mizuhara told me about it just before he left

1036
01:27:21,500 --> 01:27:22,250
Momoko

1037
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:27,540
It might be good if you think the child you will have is your truly love

1038
01:27:33,477 --> 01:27:34,930
I know this is selfish of me, but...

1039
01:27:35,383 --> 01:27:38,040
May I consider your child as my grandchild?

1040
01:27:41,235 --> 01:27:42,493
Aww..Aww..

1041
01:27:56,047 --> 01:27:58,133
I'm sorry for being selfish

1042
01:27:58,696 --> 01:28:00,024
Not at all

1043
01:28:13,493 --> 01:28:16,797
By the way How do you think about your father?

1044
01:28:22,047 --> 01:28:25,836
Well...This is my own imaginaion

1045
01:28:27,086 --> 01:28:31,063
Your father is in memory of your mother

1046
01:28:32,844 --> 01:28:35,610
You have your own mother

1047
01:28:36,883 --> 01:28:39,883
Wakako has her own mother

1048
01:28:41,297 --> 01:28:44,047
That is typically men's selfish

1049
01:28:45,391 --> 01:28:48,532
Yes you probably right

1050
01:28:49,704 --> 01:28:53,305
But this happens often in the world

1051
01:28:54,672 --> 01:28:57,782
There is no way to help your father...

1052
01:29:10,110 --> 01:29:15,727
You are too young to feel what I talk

1053
01:29:16,836 --> 01:29:21,407
I'm sorry that you blame your father for this

1054
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:26,219
Recently ,Everyday I...

1055
01:29:28,368 --> 01:29:31,461
I feel the joy of being alive today

1056
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,836
To live

1057
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:36,954
you can get over your pain and sorrow

1058
01:29:38,047 --> 01:29:40,297
I think this is the joy of life

1059
01:29:40,805 --> 01:29:41,922
What do you think?

1060
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:48,696
Wakako and her mother are the people who lives too

1061
01:29:51,594 --> 01:29:55,063
It seems your father is very tired

1062
01:29:56,477 --> 01:29:58,907
You blame your father too much

1063
01:30:00,344 --> 01:30:01,524
You think so?

1064
01:30:03,585 --> 01:30:04,742
How about this?

1065
01:30:05,977 --> 01:30:07,922
Let's make the dead bad

1066
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:11,579
Then We can feel the joy of life

1067
01:30:13,391 --> 01:30:16,118
You and your coming baby

1068
01:30:16,844 --> 01:30:19,438
Please live your  life as who you are

1069
01:30:20,438 --> 01:30:20,891
OK?

1070
01:30:30,126 --> 01:30:33,438
I can refuse it if you don't like to go

1071
01:30:34,258 --> 01:30:37,540
But my father has come to see me

1072
01:30:37,719 --> 01:30:40,696
Yes An errand boy brought you this ticket.

1073
01:30:44,297 --> 01:30:45,672
Then I'm going

1074
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:47,195
Are you going?

1075
01:30:47,227 --> 01:30:47,790
Yes

1076
01:30:48,001 --> 01:30:51,438
He will be sure to pick you up at Tokyo station

1077
01:30:52,461 --> 01:30:56,032
I'm sad to say good bye this baby

1078
01:30:56,508 --> 01:30:58,790
She has just come to our house

1079
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:04,469
Hello?

1080
01:31:05,063 --> 01:31:07,954
Oh you... from your sister

1081
01:31:09,344 --> 01:31:12,422
Hmm..Hmmm...The room is available

1082
01:31:12,594 --> 01:31:15,399
Hmm..Hmmm...That's just fine

1083
01:31:15,883 --> 01:31:19,555
Wakako prepares to go to Tokyo.
Please come home early

1084
01:31:20,516 --> 01:31:22,626
Hmm..Hmmm...That's right

1085
01:31:26,829 --> 01:31:29,586
I'm going to Tokyo

1086
01:31:32,501 --> 01:31:38,180
Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo Tokyo

1087
01:31:54,501 --> 01:31:56,961
Are you Wakako from Kyoto?

1088
01:31:57,891 --> 01:31:58,719
Yes

1089
01:31:59,141 --> 01:32:00,891
I'm here to pick you up for Mr.Mizuhara

1090
01:32:01,524 --> 01:32:02,727
Please get in the car

1091
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:04,172
Thank you

1092
01:32:06,133 --> 01:32:06,985
Please come this way

1093
01:32:07,469 --> 01:32:08,024
Thank you

1094
01:32:14,954 --> 01:32:17,790
When you see this painting " Haru no niji",Happiness will come to you

1095
01:32:18,016 --> 01:32:18,891
I see

1096
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:19,852
Wanna smoke?

1097
01:32:19,922 --> 01:32:20,695
I don't smoke

1098
01:32:21,290 --> 01:32:22,180
Oh You don't

1099
01:32:26,422 --> 01:32:27,321
Hmm..You've come

1100
01:32:27,633 --> 01:32:30,313
She'll be out of the hospital in a few days

1101
01:32:30,790 --> 01:32:32,071
That's good to hear

1102
01:32:32,430 --> 01:32:33,836
I'm glad to hear that

1103
01:32:34,266 --> 01:32:35,524
Oh Hello

1104
01:32:36,883 --> 01:32:39,282
Do you drink,Natsuji?

1105
01:32:39,313 --> 01:32:40,376
I can't drink

1106
01:32:52,782 --> 01:32:53,657
Come in

1107
01:33:14,610 --> 01:33:15,493
Wakako

1108
01:33:16,485 --> 01:33:17,321
Yes

1109
01:33:19,508 --> 01:33:21,086
Thank you for the ticket

1110
01:33:22,407 --> 01:33:23,157
A ticket?

1111
01:33:23,899 --> 01:33:25,797
Yes train ticket

1112
01:33:26,790 --> 01:33:31,915
But I've been brought here.
I don't know what should I do...

1113
01:33:32,829 --> 01:33:33,899
Who gave her the ticket?

1114
01:33:34,711 --> 01:33:36,391
I sent

1115
01:33:37,070 --> 01:33:38,055
You sent?

1116
01:33:38,094 --> 01:33:38,688
Yes

1117
01:33:40,086 --> 01:33:41,336
Welcome, Wakako

1118
01:33:44,102 --> 01:33:45,805
But It is not the first time to see me

1119
01:33:46,102 --> 01:33:47,008
Yes

1120
01:33:47,649 --> 01:33:50,993
Why did you run away from me when we were on stage dancing?

1121
01:33:51,454 --> 01:33:54,868
I didn't run away. I was just surprised

1122
01:33:55,219 --> 01:33:56,274
Why?

1123
01:33:56,860 --> 01:34:00,899
And...I didn't want to feel ostracized

1124
01:34:02,196 --> 01:34:05,305
I'm crossing the world

1125
01:34:06,360 --> 01:34:10,344
I knew I wouldn't be relying on my sisters in Tokyo.

1126
01:34:12,430 --> 01:34:16,602
And at that time. you looks very scary

1127
01:34:17,743 --> 01:34:18,766
Me?

1128
01:34:19,165 --> 01:34:21,086
Please don't get upset

1129
01:34:21,899 --> 01:34:22,938
I won't

1130
01:34:23,344 --> 01:34:25,024
I'm glad to hear that

1131
01:34:25,626 --> 01:34:28,626
But I could see you again

1132
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:35,493
I will count on you if I have a hard time in the future.

1133
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:41,399
Dad.. It is good to see her,isn't it?

1134
01:34:46,126 --> 01:34:50,047
Oh I will introduce you.
She is your sister,Asako

1135
01:34:53,422 --> 01:34:57,579
The other day, Mr. Otani came to visit me with a baby in his arms

1136
01:34:58,352 --> 01:35:00,540
Oh really? Mr.Otani came

1137
01:35:01,344 --> 01:35:03,422
He is Natsuji,Aoki

1138
01:35:04,172 --> 01:35:05,711
He will be Asako's husband

1139
01:35:06,454 --> 01:35:08,079
Haha, you are kidding

1140
01:35:10,571 --> 01:35:12,586
It's good, you think so,Natsuji?

1141
01:35:14,305 --> 01:35:16,586
Yes, That's good.
Very nice to meet you

1142
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,243
Very nice to meet you too

1143
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:23,946
Dad, Please shake hands with her

1144
01:35:28,133 --> 01:35:29,844
You've grown up

1145
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:18,251
Momoko

1146
01:36:25,415 --> 01:36:26,290
Dad...

1147
01:36:28,297 --> 01:36:30,071
Who do you think of?

1148
01:36:33,313 --> 01:36:34,438
My mother?

1149
01:36:35,477 --> 01:36:36,485
Right?

1150
01:36:43,485 --> 01:36:44,438
Dad...

1151
01:36:46,157 --> 01:36:47,860
I'm going to have a baby

1152
01:36:55,774 --> 01:37:01,758
My mother and Asako's mother also said same things like I said

1153
01:37:03,641 --> 01:37:06,813
At the time You didn't say anything too?

1154
01:37:08,094 --> 01:37:11,930
No... I said both of them like "you can have a baby.."

1155
01:37:13,735 --> 01:37:14,586
I see

1156
01:37:16,141 --> 01:37:18,711
Then you don't have to worry about me

1157
01:37:21,485 --> 01:37:22,868
Dead people are cold

1158
01:37:24,258 --> 01:37:27,602
Everyone who is alive is warm,
You think so,Dad?

1159
01:37:32,133 --> 01:37:33,039
Momoko

1160
01:37:34,914 --> 01:37:38,149
I want to shake hands with you again

1161
01:37:58,852 --> 01:38:02,492
Really? Whenever we see " Haru no niji ( A rainbow in the spring)",
We will be happy?

1162
01:38:02,938 --> 01:38:04,438
Yes, I've heard that

1163
01:38:04,641 --> 01:38:08,024
I've been lucky from the start

1164
01:38:25,555 --> 01:38:26,985
Ah, rainbow...

1165
01:38:27,352 --> 01:38:27,860
What?

1166
01:38:37,781 --> 01:38:39,453
Where is the rainbow,sister?

1167
01:38:39,508 --> 01:38:40,469
I don't see

1168
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:43,414
It was not rainbow

1169
01:38:43,946 --> 01:38:47,922
I'm sorry.. I had a feeling that there is a rainbow

1170
01:38:50,656 --> 01:38:52,179
That was well said

1171
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:55,172
Sorry for my imagination,Asa-Chan

1172
01:38:55,383 --> 01:38:58,117
My sister is good at kidding

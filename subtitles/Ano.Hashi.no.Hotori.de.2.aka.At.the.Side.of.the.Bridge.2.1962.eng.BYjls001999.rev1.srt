2
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:24,230
Are you OK,brother?

3
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,636
brother?

4
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:27,472
He'll be OK?

5
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:30,143
No worries.
His surgery went well.

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:33,592
Yoko...

7
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:34,905
Hello?

8
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,186
Oh,Chikako

9
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:39,163
What happened about Mitsuharu?

10
00:00:39,928 --> 00:00:44,897
I'm alone now.
My brother is saying something on his own.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,366
I feel worry

12
00:00:47,954 --> 00:00:50,517
He keeps saying about Yoko

13
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,173
The nurse says he's fine

14
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,790
The nurse says he's regaining his memory in his dreams.

15
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:59,564
I got relieved

16
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,399
Can you see him again?

17
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,423
I would like to see him

18
00:01:05,235 --> 00:01:05,876
But...

19
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:13,064
Doctors thought the best way to cure his amnesia was to see someone who was around at the time.

20
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,851
That's why I want you to come visit him

21
00:01:18,577 --> 00:01:20,552
OK?
Good night

22
00:01:27,662 --> 00:01:29,771
Did you get a call?

23
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:31,523
No...

24
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:34,436
Shinji hasn't come back yet,right?

25
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:35,200
Not yet

26
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,921
I really can't believe your husband hasn't come home yet.

27
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:49,331
This is a 10,000 yen necklace.
Do you like it?

28
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:19,277
<i>AT THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE (Episode 2)</i>

29
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,219
Yoko

30
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,862
I was dreaming of you all the way

31
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:10,284
Mitsuharu

32
00:03:11,252 --> 00:03:20,816
You and I were talking among beautiful flowers

33
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:24,253
I had such a dream

34
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:29,409
We used to talk in flowers

35
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,114
Then you looked me in the eye and said...

36
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:41,868
You are in my eyes

37
00:03:42,242 --> 00:03:44,564
You are in my eyes too

38
00:03:45,635 --> 00:03:49,686
I love you, Yoko

39
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,471
Mitsuharu

40
00:03:54,385 --> 00:03:55,903
Yes, I know that

41
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,102
Did you remember it?

42
00:03:58,797 --> 00:04:02,859
We went skiing in Shinshu together.

43
00:04:10,154 --> 00:04:11,850
Let's get married,Yoko

44
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,540
as soon as we graduate

45
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:20,053
I'll make you happy

46
00:04:24,236 --> 00:04:30,787
I feel like my memory is slowly coming back but...

47
00:04:31,368 --> 00:04:34,526
Don't worry.
You'll get back soon

48
00:04:35,296 --> 00:04:39,337
I only remember that I love you

49
00:04:41,535 --> 00:04:43,276
Mitsuharu

50
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:50,940
I only remember that I love you

51
00:04:58,312 --> 00:05:05,801
After I graduated from school and got a job at my sister's company, my father fell ill and I had to return to Kyushu.

52
00:05:07,082 --> 00:05:11,580
You came to see me off at Sukiyabashi

53
00:05:12,012 --> 00:05:14,847
Yes,that's right

54
00:05:15,935 --> 00:05:18,636
I was student at the time

55
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:26,437
He told me that he would pick me up after finishing school in half a year.

56
00:05:29,626 --> 00:05:32,260
I feel like my memory is slowly coming back

57
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:37,640
But Your brother opposed our marriage.

58
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:42,606
I was in Kyushu and didn't know that

59
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,948
I wrote a letter to let you know that and that happened

60
00:05:53,151 --> 00:05:55,818
Are you OK?

61
00:05:55,997 --> 00:05:58,664
Doctor!

62
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,522
I am an architectural engineer

63
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:07,836
Doctor!

64
00:06:08,205 --> 00:06:10,247
Don't worry

65
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:12,926
Yoko

66
00:06:13,216 --> 00:06:17,312
I was very confused for half a year

67
00:06:18,584 --> 00:06:22,022
My father got better, so I went back to Tokyo.

68
00:06:22,613 --> 00:06:24,031
I wanted to see you

69
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:30,705
Mitsuharu

70
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:35,459
I am not yet able to walk alone

71
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,585
I'm not what Mitsuharu Sugano used to be

72
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:43,580
Look what my hands are

73
00:06:44,384 --> 00:06:45,935
Look what my legs are

74
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:48,949
I changed myself

75
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,891
I can't believe it

76
00:06:51,696 --> 00:06:55,569
if you have any reason,tell me honestly

77
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:11,357
I regret telling you that

78
00:07:13,864 --> 00:07:14,712
Yeah

79
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:22,648
I injured my right hand and thought I could no longer design.

80
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:32,543
Sorry.
Did I bother you?

81
00:07:33,023 --> 00:07:34,552
No...

82
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:42,770
Toki encouraged me all the way

83
00:07:45,237 --> 00:07:49,590
She was my neighbor in the same apartment and always took care of me.

84
00:07:49,634 --> 00:07:53,630
These croquettes smell so good that I bought a lot.

85
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:55,621
Toki also loved you?

86
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,849
No... I had nothing to do with her

87
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:09,192
But I couldn't believe it until I heard about her

88
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:14,449
I found that out when you came to Hokkaido.

89
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,936
Hokkaido.

90
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:29,077
I was always struggling to forget you then.

91
00:09:10,611 --> 00:09:15,656
I heard you had an arranged marriage.

92
00:09:16,319 --> 00:09:18,216
My brother cheated on me

93
00:09:19,042 --> 00:09:24,321
When Ms. Toki told me about you, I went to see you.
Fujikawa and Aya saw me off

94
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,386
Good luck

95
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,301
Yoko

96
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:03,992
Mitsuharu

97
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,151
I lost my happiness

98
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,186
because of Nobu

99
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,825
This is his watch, you know?

100
00:10:21,012 --> 00:10:25,108
He left this in my bed this morning

101
00:10:25,599 --> 00:10:27,798
I can't believe it

102
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:34,750
Yoko

103
00:10:35,163 --> 00:10:36,078
Hold on

104
00:10:36,591 --> 00:10:37,785
I feel sorry about you

105
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,022
Do you blame me?

106
00:10:41,401 --> 00:10:44,605
I was just being honest.

107
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,006
I blamed her too much

108
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,674
I was too selfish at that time

109
00:10:53,455 --> 00:10:56,926
He broke our relationship

110
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:01,279
he broke our relationship

111
00:11:01,747 --> 00:11:05,486
Please die with me

112
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:07,160
Calm down

113
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:10,609
I'll go to die if you don't like

114
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:12,406
Hold on!

115
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:20,040
You fell off a cliff and you lost your memory.

116
00:11:20,464 --> 00:11:23,957
I can't remember anything from it

117
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:26,993
Don't push yourself too hard

118
00:11:27,477 --> 00:11:30,669
You just had surgery

119
00:11:34,174 --> 00:11:39,810
His memory has fully returned.
But some are still missing

120
00:11:40,357 --> 00:11:42,946
I worry about it

121
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:45,100
Can it be unrecoverable?

122
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:50,118
He doesn't know me at all?

123
00:11:51,491 --> 00:11:52,485
No way

124
00:11:52,510 --> 00:12:00,487
Sometimes people can't remember even if they try

125
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:06,055
I think he will remember if something happens

126
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,865
So he needs your help

127
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,896
Can you see him often?

128
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,787
I would try

129
00:12:21,283 --> 00:12:25,501
I knew immediately what this was when I received this from Mr. Fujikawa.

130
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,801
He told me this was my work

131
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:33,783
I also remember that I was in the middle of designing this

132
00:12:35,033 --> 00:12:38,448
That's good what you remember

133
00:12:41,213 --> 00:12:42,798
But not all

134
00:12:44,438 --> 00:12:45,287
YOKO

135
00:12:46,693 --> 00:12:49,885
You and I parted like that in Hokkaido.

136
00:12:51,533 --> 00:12:53,118
It's been more than a year

137
00:12:56,187 --> 00:13:03,620
I always think of you in this bed

138
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,887
I'm wondering how you're spending the year at that time

139
00:13:11,811 --> 00:13:14,054
Tell me what you think

140
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,525
Why Fujikawa doesn't want to talk about you?

141
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,003
I want to know that

142
00:13:21,818 --> 00:13:24,508
Please tell me everything you know

143
00:13:27,659 --> 00:13:31,677
I met Mitsuharu all the time

144
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:38,463
I visited him when I came to Tokyo

145
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:43,842
I went with him to Sukiyabashi and your apartment in Gotanda.

146
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:51,788
I asked you to remember me, but at that time your memory did not return.

147
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:52,704
Hold on

148
00:13:53,652 --> 00:13:56,331
You guys visited my apartment?

149
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:04,732
Yeah, that was my room

150
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:11,362
I'm Yasuo Tateno.
People call me any way

151
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:18,329
But I don't know what they call me.
I don't even know what name is Mitsuharu

152
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:24,384
Who are you?
And why you are here?

153
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:30,779
I'm wife of Sawano.
I'm here for visiting you

154
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:17,145
I thought Mitsuharu was died

155
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:28,388
After returning from Hokkaido, I did as my brother said.

156
00:15:29,854 --> 00:15:31,115
I see

157
00:15:32,466 --> 00:15:43,020
I got married with Sawano..
So we can't see each other anymore

158
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,659
Yoko

159
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,786
Take care of your health

160
00:15:55,907 --> 00:15:57,101
Sis

161
00:17:47,536 --> 00:17:48,384
Welcome back

162
00:17:48,473 --> 00:17:50,002
I'm home

163
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,639
Yoko

164
00:17:56,862 --> 00:17:58,034
I'm back now

165
00:17:58,347 --> 00:18:01,327
You were always with Omori's older brother, weren't you?

166
00:18:01,352 --> 00:18:02,060
Yes

167
00:18:02,171 --> 00:18:03,767
His sister was at his house?

168
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:05,452
Yes

169
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,863
I see.
Come with me

170
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,226
Yoko

171
00:18:18,112 --> 00:18:20,936
Where have you been?
You cheated me

172
00:18:25,775 --> 00:18:27,963
Say sorry to her

173
00:18:28,052 --> 00:18:30,306
I won't forgive her

174
00:18:30,451 --> 00:18:31,445
Yoko

175
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,360
I know where have you been

176
00:18:32,996 --> 00:18:34,949
I knew you visited him at the hospital

177
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,959
Are you sure,Yoko?

178
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:43,550
she tricked me into going to see him

179
00:18:44,789 --> 00:18:46,642
I didn't mean that

180
00:18:47,093 --> 00:18:48,745
Why did you trick me?

181
00:18:50,218 --> 00:18:53,187
I feel bad for lying to you

182
00:18:53,801 --> 00:18:57,149
I thought I shouldn't be honest

183
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:02,402
You are the wife of Shinsuke.
You can't see other men

184
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,114
I'm sorry

185
00:19:05,292 --> 00:19:07,863
I'll teach her.
Please forgive her

186
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:11,168
I won't forgive her,
So I asked you pick her up

187
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:21,334
Please talk to her and Kenjiro.
I'll discuss about her with Shinsuke too

188
00:19:32,528 --> 00:19:37,595
Hi Sugano.
You know who I am?

189
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,006
What's wrong,Chikako?

190
00:19:40,129 --> 00:19:44,693
You know my name?
Who told you?

191
00:19:45,485 --> 00:19:48,364
No worried.
My memory got return

192
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:50,529
Really?

193
00:19:52,002 --> 00:19:54,836
I know you are 13 years old

194
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:55,641
And?

195
00:19:56,578 --> 00:19:57,639
I know you like Steamed bread

196
00:19:58,018 --> 00:19:59,380
Yes,and?

197
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:03,431
you like playing the harmonica

198
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:06,378
Yes but not very good

199
00:20:08,225 --> 00:20:11,684
How's him,Chikako?

200
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:18,493
Her parents died and she was raised by relatives.

201
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:22,895
I drowned in the river and was saved by the relative.

202
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:25,083
That's good you remember it

203
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:29,436
I was worried about his memory

204
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:32,469
Don't cry

205
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:36,788
I haven't forgotten to find your grandfather

206
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:42,357
I'm glad if you are with me even if we can't find my grand father

207
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:51,675
I'm glad you get better.
Get well soon and leave the hospital

208
00:20:53,036 --> 00:20:56,251
Mr. Imura was worried about his work.

209
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:06,942
Mr. Imura says he will be able to leave the hospital in a few days.
Will Mitsuharu Sugano be able to work immediately after being discharged from the hospital?

210
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,552
He needs some rest

211
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:16,132
if he needs a month rest

212
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,526
If so, the design will be delayed.

213
00:21:20,062 --> 00:21:26,078
Our office will work with you on that and try to get it done as soon as possible.

214
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:34,756
He has a brain disorder, so I'm worried about putting him in charge of this design.

215
00:21:34,991 --> 00:21:40,582
I wanted to build a building with a new feel, so I recommended Mr. Sugano.

216
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:44,856
I will judge whether he is in charge of this work.

217
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:46,888
What do you think?

218
00:21:47,078 --> 00:21:53,852
You're right. but it'll be inconvenienced if this work delay

219
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:02,292
You work so hard

220
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,370
No worries.
I'm happy to work

221
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:10,993
I would like to see the building you designed

222
00:22:18,217 --> 00:22:20,527
What's wrong?

223
00:22:20,728 --> 00:22:22,926
Sugano will be discharged from the hospital tomorrow.

224
00:22:23,328 --> 00:22:25,917
I see.
He'll stay here?

225
00:22:25,942 --> 00:22:30,237
Yes.
Fujikawa visited me and asked me to clean the room

226
00:22:30,538 --> 00:22:33,295
She's so cheeky

227
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,081
You're in a lot of trouble.

228
00:22:40,085 --> 00:22:40,476
Eh?

229
00:22:40,755 --> 00:22:45,632
Mr. Fujikawa said that even if he leaves the hospital, he won't worry as long as he stays here.

230
00:22:47,641 --> 00:22:50,040
He know nothing about us

231
00:22:53,333 --> 00:22:56,447
I want to go back to my hometown

232
00:22:56,472 --> 00:22:57,775
Why?

233
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,822
I'm really sorry that Yoko caused you trouble.

234
00:23:05,847 --> 00:23:08,266
I'm not upset about it

235
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:13,463
I'm here because our president was worried about you.

236
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,331
Sorry for the inconvenience.

237
00:23:16,711 --> 00:23:18,050
I want sweets

238
00:23:18,217 --> 00:23:21,097
I'll give you later.
Go outside and play

239
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:24,209
you apologize to her

240
00:23:27,887 --> 00:23:31,575
I'm sorry I lied to you

241
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:35,466
But it can't be helped

242
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,563
Please understand me

243
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,438
What should I understand?

244
00:23:44,173 --> 00:23:48,946
The doctor told me to come to him to cure his disease.

245
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,852
Don't get me wrong

246
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,813
He already know about it

247
00:23:54,907 --> 00:23:59,407
But I think it would be very sad to take his job away from him.

248
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:00,329
Job?

249
00:24:01,001 --> 00:24:01,977
What the hell?

250
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:03,001
Yoko

251
00:24:03,056 --> 00:24:06,204
I think it's very sad that they won't let him design the building.

252
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,255
I hope you understand about my feeling

253
00:24:10,255 --> 00:24:11,098
Miura

254
00:24:12,348 --> 00:24:16,161
The company has not yet made that decision.
What the hell?

255
00:24:16,637 --> 00:24:19,473
I'm sorry but you should scold her

256
00:24:20,512 --> 00:24:24,434
You have nothing to do with the Sugano now

257
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,063
You want me to understand that?

258
00:24:27,406 --> 00:24:32,914
You have nothing to do with the Sugano now.
Why you care about him?

259
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,594
He's saying right

260
00:24:38,071 --> 00:24:41,242
You can't go home unless you forget him

261
00:24:41,852 --> 00:24:42,461
I'm leaving now

262
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:43,875
You should apologize to him.

263
00:24:44,227 --> 00:24:44,922
Miura

264
00:24:45,313 --> 00:24:46,414
Leave her alone

265
00:24:48,248 --> 00:24:48,904
Boss

266
00:24:50,474 --> 00:24:52,169
I am very sorry today

267
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,927
What the hell?

268
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,537
I am very sorry today

269
00:25:05,857 --> 00:25:07,865
why did you argue with him?

270
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,013
He came to pick you up

271
00:25:10,294 --> 00:25:13,794
I wanted him to understand my feelings

272
00:25:13,857 --> 00:25:14,920
Don't be too selfish

273
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:19,826
You are wife of Shinsuke Sawano.
You are so happy woman

274
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:22,842
you have to be patient

275
00:25:23,818 --> 00:25:27,053
Do you think I’m really happy?

276
00:25:27,795 --> 00:25:28,412
What?

277
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:32,498
Does it mean that I am happy to have money?

278
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:33,326
Stop saying

279
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:35,170
I know what's in your mind

280
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:38,053
You stupid!

281
00:25:38,521 --> 00:25:39,514
Stop it

282
00:25:41,584 --> 00:25:46,631
You mean you're getting in the way of my career, right?

283
00:25:55,435 --> 00:25:57,490
Thank you for coming

284
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,350
Let's toast for Fujikawa

285
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:03,662
Take care of your health

286
00:26:07,239 --> 00:26:09,060
I'm glad Sugano is here

287
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:09,864
How about me?

288
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,997
I'm more glad

289
00:26:16,222 --> 00:26:18,402
I am very much indebted to you too

290
00:26:18,628 --> 00:26:21,121
Don't be too serious

291
00:26:21,535 --> 00:26:26,160
I couldn't do anything for you.

292
00:26:27,175 --> 00:26:28,300
No way

293
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:32,865
It can't be helped

294
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,365
I can only comfort you

295
00:26:39,912 --> 00:26:41,232
That's enough

296
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:47,889
How long do you plan to stay in Hokkaido, Mr. Fujikawa?

297
00:26:48,568 --> 00:26:49,537
At least half year

298
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,357
I think it will take a year

299
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:52,537
It's too long

300
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:54,209
She'll miss him

301
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:56,436
No way.
I feel glad

302
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:58,831
Shut up

303
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,885
Bros

304
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:10,342
Where's Yoko?

305
00:27:11,413 --> 00:27:12,592
What's wrong with her?

306
00:27:12,858 --> 00:27:14,788
She went to see you

307
00:27:15,024 --> 00:27:15,579
I have no idea

308
00:27:15,604 --> 00:27:16,532
You don't know?

309
00:27:16,557 --> 00:27:18,329
She's left home

310
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,087
Are you sure?

311
00:27:20,962 --> 00:27:22,876
Don't lie to me

312
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:24,712
Calm down

313
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:26,759
you said terrible things to him

314
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:31,008
Is she really not here?

315
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:33,438
Call Sugano and ask about it

316
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,399
I was misunderstood

317
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:40,274
Call me when you find her

318
00:27:41,511 --> 00:27:42,433
Hold on

319
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,065
Why she's left home?

320
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,566
It's none of your business

321
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:49,308
Tell me

322
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,378
We need to know why so we can find her.

323
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:53,640
Reason?

324
00:27:54,898 --> 00:27:57,234
Because of Sugano

325
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,634
Are you leaving?

326
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,486
I'm sorry I'm late

327
00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:14,079
Yoko's left home

328
00:28:15,001 --> 00:28:19,595
I thought Yoko was happy

329
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:22,954
I have been concerned about this for some time.

330
00:28:22,986 --> 00:28:26,009
Did you find her?

331
00:28:27,567 --> 00:28:30,653
It seems that Yoko is not in the apartment

332
00:28:30,817 --> 00:28:32,340
Where she's gone?

333
00:28:37,704 --> 00:28:40,360
Please adjust the money

334
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:43,485
This is an admission ticket.
Where are you going?

335
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:45,907
To Sasebo,Kyushu

336
00:28:46,048 --> 00:28:47,071
Hold on

337
00:28:48,728 --> 00:28:50,627
Yoko

338
00:28:58,408 --> 00:29:01,549
I think it's hard to forget her

339
00:29:02,346 --> 00:29:04,947
But I think she'll contact you later

340
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:08,027
Sugano

341
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:16,566
I want you to be happy.
Please stay honest

342
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:20,923
See you

343
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:23,111
Good luck

344
00:29:24,705 --> 00:29:26,017
Don't cry

345
00:29:26,377 --> 00:29:27,838
I wanna go with you

346
00:29:28,134 --> 00:29:30,744
You can go with him for Hokkaido

347
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:32,447
Get off

348
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:34,306
I'll be honest

349
00:29:34,666 --> 00:29:37,134
He said about Yoko and Sugano.
Not you

350
00:29:37,393 --> 00:29:39,463
It's OK

351
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,209
Get off now.
You don't have package

352
00:29:41,234 --> 00:29:43,600
I have already sent the package

353
00:29:43,857 --> 00:29:45,592
Madam said to me that

354
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:49,452
See you,Sis

355
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:51,178
Good luck

356
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,131
Good luck

357
00:29:54,046 --> 00:29:57,108
See you

358
00:30:00,566 --> 00:30:01,824
She'll be happy

359
00:30:03,082 --> 00:30:05,738
They are nice.
I'm sure they'll be happy

360
00:30:06,785 --> 00:30:07,660
Let's go home

361
00:30:21,408 --> 00:30:23,556
Shimonoseki is Toki's home town

362
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:29,861
I found out Yoko was here from Fujikawa's letter

363
00:30:45,229 --> 00:30:46,948
Sorry for the unexpected visit.

364
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:52,174
My house is small but wanna come in?

365
00:30:52,284 --> 00:30:54,557
Yoko is not here

366
00:30:56,844 --> 00:31:00,462
She left yesterday.
She's gone to Kyushu

367
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:08,516
Here is my home town.
I graduated from that school

368
00:31:13,981 --> 00:31:14,731
Toki

369
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:18,785
What did Yoko say?

370
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:24,457
Well..She told me she regretted a lot

371
00:31:25,012 --> 00:31:25,996
Like what?

372
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:30,621
So I told her

373
00:31:31,481 --> 00:31:35,184
It was fate that Mitsuharu died once.

374
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,293
So no one will blame you if you get married with other man

375
00:31:40,371 --> 00:31:42,723
You should get your life again

376
00:31:46,877 --> 00:31:49,010
But She is stubborn

377
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:55,283
She told me It was fate that Mitsuharu died, but It was not fate that I got married to Sawano

378
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,172
It was my responsibility

379
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:04,633
I felt irritating about her

380
00:32:06,662 --> 00:32:10,694
Yoko left to Kyushu because of me

381
00:32:11,491 --> 00:32:13,342
Why?

382
00:32:14,373 --> 00:32:19,334
I blamed her when she was in trouble

383
00:32:19,803 --> 00:32:20,436
Toki

384
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:22,288
You know what

385
00:32:24,311 --> 00:32:29,436
If I were her, I would act like her

386
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:40,001
I was serious to get married with someone when you've gone to Hokkaido

387
00:32:44,237 --> 00:32:46,386
But no one wanna get married with me

388
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,443
That's Kyushu

389
00:32:57,904 --> 00:32:59,521
Yoko is there

390
00:33:04,132 --> 00:33:08,672
You should go to see her whatever Yoko feels

391
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:11,648
You should go to see her

392
00:33:12,912 --> 00:33:15,342
I boarded this ship 3 years ago too

393
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:19,224
You and I were lovers at that time

394
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:24,295
You are married woman now.
I'm here for you

395
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:31,201
Her Brother Kenjiro picked her up.
They headed to Miyazaki

396
00:33:32,092 --> 00:33:32,725
Miyazaki?

397
00:33:33,014 --> 00:33:38,248
They left this morning.
Her husband Sawano seems to be there

398
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:43,483
I see.
Yoko made up her mind to see her husband

399
00:33:44,444 --> 00:33:47,881
Do they solve the problem?

400
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,412
I see.
That's good for them

401
00:33:54,001 --> 00:33:57,798
I worried about what she is doing

402
00:33:59,188 --> 00:34:01,743
I wonder she is happy now

403
00:34:04,637 --> 00:34:13,402
I scolded her to support her husband once they were married.

404
00:34:14,854 --> 00:34:17,557
I regret what I said to her

405
00:34:22,284 --> 00:34:28,252
I was in trouble,
I didn't feel like going back to Tokyo

406
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:32,637
So I visited in Miyazaki

407
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,551
I can't forget about Yoko

408
00:34:39,081 --> 00:34:43,612
I wanna see you in person

409
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,458
Welcome back

410
00:34:58,843 --> 00:35:01,788
So she would go home?

411
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:05,163
My father and I talked to her

412
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:09,850
She decided to go home.
She was concerned about public perception.

413
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,421
Welcome back

414
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,405
Your boss is with you

415
00:35:18,593 --> 00:35:21,507
Why you left earlier?

416
00:35:21,764 --> 00:35:24,530
I can't play golf

417
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:26,524
I need to talk with him

418
00:35:27,445 --> 00:35:28,156
OK

419
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:41,522
It's inconvenient that Kobayashi stay at this inn

420
00:35:41,678 --> 00:35:42,686
Why?

421
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:45,944
Yoko feels strange.
You stay here

422
00:35:46,733 --> 00:35:48,491
I'll go to see her

423
00:36:03,196 --> 00:36:04,899
I was sorry

424
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,384
When did you get arrived?

425
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,118
Around noon

426
00:36:13,241 --> 00:36:14,523
Never mind

427
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:19,898
Are you here for work?

428
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:24,026
We are building a factory on the coast.

429
00:36:25,229 --> 00:36:28,495
Secretaries should stay in a separate hotel while on business trips.

430
00:36:28,815 --> 00:36:30,995
That's inconvenient

431
00:36:32,012 --> 00:36:34,301
And your boss asked me to stay here

432
00:36:35,364 --> 00:36:36,755
You're so cheeky

433
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:42,380
Ok I will stay at another hotel

434
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,278
I will find it

435
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,458
No thanks.
I will find it

436
00:36:58,626 --> 00:36:59,993
Give me some beers

437
00:37:00,368 --> 00:37:01,908
Here's too boring

438
00:37:05,259 --> 00:37:08,103
There is no place where I play at night

439
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:13,882
Quiet tourist destinations are rare.

440
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:18,039
You sound like an old man.

441
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:23,226
I feel so boring

442
00:37:23,914 --> 00:37:24,992
Have you been to sightseeing?

443
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:26,531
Little

444
00:37:26,765 --> 00:37:29,500
You're lying

445
00:37:31,392 --> 00:37:34,431
Sorry I'm drunk

446
00:37:35,642 --> 00:37:37,235
Are you on trip too?

447
00:37:37,931 --> 00:37:39,454
Kind of

448
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:46,581
She went on a school trip.
My classmates said this place is great.

449
00:37:47,097 --> 00:37:50,136
So I decided to come here

450
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,495
You didn't go on a school trip.

451
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,269
I had no money

452
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:04,830
Sorry, I'm getting sleepy

453
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,486
I need to go back

454
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:20,886
I have one request for you

455
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:29,313
Don't get angry.
I would like to ask you about the design of the new building.

456
00:38:32,627 --> 00:38:35,651
Please let Sugano-san handle that job.

457
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:40,551
He did nothing wrong.
Is that bad?

458
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:45,033
Well..that'll be fine

459
00:40:03,711 --> 00:40:05,519
Yoko!

460
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:31,175
As long as you are truly happy I am fine. So tell me if you are happy or not

461
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,375
You don't answer..that means you are not happy,right?

462
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:55,729
I got married for various reasons

463
00:40:57,422 --> 00:41:04,710
I don't have the confidence to throw them away and start over.

464
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:10,372
we'll be fine if we work together

465
00:41:12,057 --> 00:41:17,492
Now you and I are in different positions

466
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:25,249
Why you got married?

467
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:30,394
Why you were missing in Hokkaido?

468
00:41:32,001 --> 00:41:35,930
Why did you lie to me at SUKIYABASHI two years ago?

469
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:47,788
I came to Shimonoseki, Sasebo, and Miyazaki in search of you.

470
00:41:49,183 --> 00:41:53,871
It's been a long journey, but I had hope

471
00:41:54,663 --> 00:41:58,491
I also went to Hokkaido to find you

472
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:07,226
I traveled alone by train and ship.
I was lonely

473
00:42:08,113 --> 00:42:15,970
I loved you then more than I love you now.

474
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:26,534
Oh Madam

475
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,196
Wait

476
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,235
let's go back to Tokyo with me

477
00:42:47,238 --> 00:42:48,622
You don't love me now?

478
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:50,508
I love you

479
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:00,300
Yoko..then..

480
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:04,050
It's too late

481
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,279
Good morning

482
00:43:36,502 --> 00:43:37,685
Good morning

483
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:41,312
It's been a age.
You arrived here yesterday

484
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:49,343
I'll leave first.

485
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:52,368
We'll have meeting today

486
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,013
But you don't need me

487
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:58,049
Please contact Yoshida Construction Company when you return.

488
00:43:58,283 --> 00:44:00,604
do you have a meeting with the design engineer?

489
00:44:00,812 --> 00:44:02,687
I will say hello to the manager

490
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,395
Thanks

491
00:44:05,411 --> 00:44:10,455
Have you decided who will be the architect of the new building?

492
00:44:10,757 --> 00:44:12,565
Yes we've decided

493
00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:15,925
Do you still worry about it?

494
00:44:17,912 --> 00:44:21,327
He cheated me

495
00:44:22,611 --> 00:44:25,367
I was suddenly kicked out of my house

496
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:32,164
I was just surprised that my wife came suddenly.

497
00:44:32,447 --> 00:44:34,624
Did you get along with her again?

498
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:39,222
It's ok if you wanna leave here

499
00:45:10,022 --> 00:45:16,439
You were able to reconcile with your husband.
I'm sorry

500
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,582
Don't get upset

501
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:22,733
I'll keep it a secret what happened this morning

502
00:45:34,437 --> 00:45:35,910
Yoko

503
00:45:41,005 --> 00:45:41,964
Dad

504
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,337
Yoko

505
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,255
Did you meet with Sugano?

506
00:45:48,761 --> 00:45:53,996
I regret saying something terrible to you

507
00:45:54,576 --> 00:46:00,814
I came here to worry about you.
I'd like to bring you back home if that's okay with you.

508
00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:04,348
Dad

509
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:35,299
I regret not letting you marry Mr. Sugano

510
00:46:39,053 --> 00:46:42,624
Forget about that

511
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:51,960
I won't cry anymore,Mitsuharu

512
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,893
Happiness doesn't come from crying

513
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:21,913
A year later

514
00:47:28,103 --> 00:47:36,831
Your wife wants a divorce because of marital differences and her relationship with your mother-in-law.

515
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:42,735
So you think it was Mitsuharu Sugano

516
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,963
yeah

517
00:47:45,023 --> 00:47:51,508
I think you're jealous of him

518
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,070
That's not true

519
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:56,678
I loved her

520
00:47:56,703 --> 00:48:03,933
But you guys have already been separated for more than half a year.

521
00:48:03,958 --> 00:48:05,167
No way

522
00:48:06,335 --> 00:48:07,552
I loved her

523
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:08,467
But

524
00:48:08,578 --> 00:48:12,663
I loved her.
she is poor but I got married with her

525
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:19,990
I want you guys to make up

526
00:48:21,006 --> 00:48:24,957
If you can't do that, then I hope you get an amicable divorce.

527
00:48:26,211 --> 00:48:31,077
we have been talking about it for half a year

528
00:48:32,986 --> 00:48:35,932
I wanna ask you one thing

529
00:48:38,686 --> 00:48:48,708
Do you intend to withdraw your divorce request and think again

530
00:48:50,478 --> 00:48:53,168
No at all

531
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,018
Come in,Sawano

532
00:49:01,968 --> 00:49:03,575
Have a seat

533
00:49:09,925 --> 00:49:15,762
We have been trying for a long time to find an amicable solution.

534
00:49:16,309 --> 00:49:19,233
But We couldn't make it

535
00:49:19,747 --> 00:49:28,731
As far as the court is concerned, there is no further progress in this conversation, so I would like to terminate it now.

536
00:49:31,571 --> 00:49:32,442
madam

537
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:37,721
Divorce is not allowed unless your husband allows it

538
00:49:38,334 --> 00:49:46,839
Your husband doesn't want to live with you and wants to rent a house somewhere and have you live there.

539
00:49:47,937 --> 00:49:48,941
tashiro

540
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:50,515
See you again

541
00:50:01,015 --> 00:50:02,242
Welcome

542
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:03,794
Thank you for coming

543
00:50:03,819 --> 00:50:06,316
I've been looking for your house

544
00:50:06,997 --> 00:50:13,202
CHIKAKO rushes home from school on Saturday and goes to Hamamatsu right away by train!

545
00:50:13,537 --> 00:50:19,285
The Brother asked me to come because he is lonely.

546
00:50:19,796 --> 00:50:24,796
You are good.
How's Mitsuharu?

547
00:50:24,897 --> 00:50:26,526
He's fine

548
00:50:30,582 --> 00:50:34,020
You should go to Hamamatsu too.

549
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:40,404
You should meet him and talk about various things

550
00:50:41,575 --> 00:50:43,104
It's the time

551
00:50:43,406 --> 00:50:46,486
I can't go

552
00:50:46,776 --> 00:50:50,850
You've failed in divorce mediation, and now you're going to a divorce trial, right?

553
00:50:51,564 --> 00:50:56,654
I can't help you.
I don't think you can solve it by yourself

554
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,415
I don't know what to do too

555
00:51:02,078 --> 00:51:04,600
It is my responsibility to marry with Sawano

556
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:09,042
I said good bye to Mitsuharu in Kyushu

557
00:51:11,002 --> 00:51:13,356
I will be patient as my divorce is finalized.

558
00:51:15,488 --> 00:51:16,973
It can't be helped

559
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:22,285
Keep this story a secret from him

560
00:51:24,138 --> 00:51:28,189
I find it painful for her to lie to him

561
00:51:29,692 --> 00:51:31,009
I'm sorry

562
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:41,410
Are you Sawano's wife from Toyo Light Metal?

563
00:51:43,105 --> 00:51:43,752
Yes

564
00:51:44,087 --> 00:51:45,795
I see

565
00:51:47,513 --> 00:51:50,717
Do you know about him?

566
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:53,306
He is a client of ours and I have met him a few times.

567
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:55,367
Thanks

568
00:52:00,891 --> 00:52:04,039
he is a very good lawyer

569
00:52:04,418 --> 00:52:06,070
Don't make me laugh

570
00:52:06,148 --> 00:52:07,387
Am I bothering you?

571
00:52:07,412 --> 00:52:09,820
It's OK.
I can't be loud

572
00:52:10,166 --> 00:52:14,682
Do we settle in district court?

573
00:52:14,917 --> 00:52:15,464
Yes

574
00:52:15,587 --> 00:52:18,031
I will support you

575
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:20,654
Can we pay in installments?

576
00:52:21,123 --> 00:52:24,225
Ok that'll be fine

577
00:52:24,303 --> 00:52:26,234
I hope my own body recovers.

578
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:29,214
your appendix will heal soon

579
00:52:29,414 --> 00:52:32,015
You'll get well soon

580
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,196
Please take care of me.
I'm old fart

581
00:52:36,056 --> 00:52:38,198
You're still young

582
00:52:38,377 --> 00:52:41,245
you are good at flattery

583
00:52:42,741 --> 00:52:44,147
Bros

584
00:52:48,518 --> 00:52:50,326
You've been raised

585
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:55,080
What's wrong?

586
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:57,312
I just greet you

587
00:53:00,645 --> 00:53:02,665
I tell you before I forget

588
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:04,740
What?

589
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:09,562
Toki told me if you ask me about Yoko

590
00:53:09,663 --> 00:53:10,623
Then?

591
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:16,739
She told me to tell you she is fine.

592
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:19,350
That's good if she is happy

593
00:53:20,975 --> 00:53:22,381
Do you worry about her?

594
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:24,077
Yes

595
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,195
You're already adult

596
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:29,736
Toki is fine?

597
00:53:29,761 --> 00:53:33,653
She's busy.
The patient she is in charge of now is a lawyer.

598
00:53:33,694 --> 00:53:35,870
she said it was convenient

599
00:53:36,417 --> 00:53:37,488
Why?

600
00:53:39,107 --> 00:53:43,035
Well...she's studying law

601
00:53:43,503 --> 00:53:44,307
Really?

602
00:53:47,153 --> 00:53:50,211
I can't believe what you say

603
00:53:53,934 --> 00:54:00,697
We will now begin deliberations on the divorce of Yoko Sawano and Shinsuke Sawano.

604
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,421
where is the plaintiff's attorney?

605
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:04,470
Well

606
00:54:04,715 --> 00:54:06,189
What's wrong?

607
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:13,432
Sorry

608
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:18,130
Sorry I'm late

609
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:22,396
You should be prepared to substantiate.

610
00:54:23,043 --> 00:54:24,796
Wait a min

611
00:54:32,605 --> 00:54:37,214
I will slightly change the purpose and cause of the divorce request.

612
00:54:37,515 --> 00:54:42,080
In short,we will claim 1 million yen from him as compensation.

613
00:54:43,341 --> 00:54:45,439
Yoko..you are so mean

614
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:49,111
Sensei

615
00:54:49,591 --> 00:54:51,388
Leave it to me.
This is the way to win the case

616
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:58,754
Yoko

617
00:54:59,744 --> 00:55:04,264
I think it's a very terrible way to claim alimony from him.

618
00:55:04,365 --> 00:55:06,697
You should speak up on the witness stand it

619
00:55:06,954 --> 00:55:07,735
I will

620
00:55:07,981 --> 00:55:13,327
Thanks.
Because you the judge will know what kind of mother-in-law you are.

621
00:55:17,342 --> 00:55:19,436
you should have divorced her earlier

622
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:21,975
You were also concerned about other people's eyes and opposed the divorce.

623
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,038
Don't get argue

624
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:26,057
What do you think?

625
00:55:26,354 --> 00:55:28,245
No worries.
Leave it to me

626
00:55:34,384 --> 00:55:35,080
Yoko

627
00:55:38,314 --> 00:55:42,564
I consulted with the president.
You have been asked to leave this company.

628
00:55:42,955 --> 00:55:44,345
Eh? Why?

629
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,244
It's a problem with Sawano's house, isn't it?

630
00:55:47,853 --> 00:55:49,040
That's so mean

631
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:55,587
This company does business with our company.
It is not convenient for us to have you working for us.

632
00:55:57,626 --> 00:56:01,220
Are you sure?
I'm not allowed to work here?

633
00:56:02,673 --> 00:56:06,985
Your brother said you wanted to be with Sawano-san again.

634
00:56:07,454 --> 00:56:08,743
That's not true

635
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:13,361
I wanted to divorce him, so I went to court.

636
00:56:13,939 --> 00:56:16,400
I see.
Hold on

637
00:56:17,079 --> 00:56:20,720
Niimuera.
That's what I thought

638
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:26,986
The person I hired is Yoko.
Not Sawano's wife

639
00:56:28,072 --> 00:56:30,220
So forget this issue

640
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,157
Are you sure?
May I report this to the manager?

641
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:37,977
we also have a deal

642
00:56:38,446 --> 00:56:44,524
you are a very big company.
I can't believe you would do something like that, so I'll call your president and see.

643
00:56:44,558 --> 00:56:46,636
Hold on.
You don't have to

644
00:56:50,393 --> 00:56:53,393
The president of your company is a woman, so you seem to understand how women feel.

645
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:54,542
It might be so

646
00:56:54,800 --> 00:56:57,956
That's good she is nice person

647
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,659
We're back

648
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,702
Where did you arrived?

649
00:57:10,556 --> 00:57:12,619
Sis, he is....

650
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:16,424
I'm here because I want to talk to you

651
00:57:16,791 --> 00:57:20,174
I see.
I invited her for dinner

652
00:57:22,107 --> 00:57:23,420
Come in,Yoko

653
00:57:32,637 --> 00:57:35,621
It's been a age,Yoko

654
00:57:41,168 --> 00:57:46,973
Sorry for the unexpected visit.

655
00:57:47,543 --> 00:57:51,168
he is going abroad

656
00:57:51,653 --> 00:57:52,121
Eh?

657
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:55,293
To Ka...what name is it

658
00:57:56,918 --> 00:58:01,551
At the request of Professor Imura, I decided to go to Cambodia.

659
00:58:01,957 --> 00:58:03,293
I'll go for him

660
00:58:04,114 --> 00:58:06,348
Where will you depart?

661
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:11,246
There is a visa issue, but I will be there by the end of next month.

662
00:58:12,418 --> 00:58:15,965
Why don't you tell us anything?

663
00:58:17,887 --> 00:58:19,160
Yoko

664
00:58:19,785 --> 00:58:21,981
What's wrong with her?

665
00:58:22,512 --> 00:58:23,317
Yoko will...

666
00:58:23,403 --> 00:58:23,903
Toki

667
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:27,044
Let me say.
She's working now

668
00:58:28,987 --> 00:58:34,081
She is in court to separate from her and her husband.

669
00:58:34,954 --> 00:58:37,352
Are you sure,Yoko?

670
00:58:51,401 --> 00:58:57,979
I worked hard to forget you this past year

671
00:58:59,182 --> 00:59:01,229
That's also the reason why I go to Cambodia

672
00:59:02,323 --> 00:59:06,346
But the truth is, I thought of you every day.

673
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:11,496
I thought of you every day too

674
00:59:11,941 --> 00:59:16,972
I didn't know you were suffering so much.

675
00:59:17,958 --> 00:59:22,427
I wanted to divorce Sawano on my own.

676
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:27,217
I am trying to solve it myself

677
00:59:28,412 --> 00:59:31,826
I wanted to get back myself, Yoko Niimura, and saw you again

678
00:59:33,186 --> 00:59:37,428
I thought it was the only way I could get you to forgive me

679
00:59:39,445 --> 00:59:43,226
Yoko, don't think too much

680
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,413
Mitsuharu

681
00:59:48,022 --> 00:59:50,967
I haven't changed my mind

682
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,342
Me too

683
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:55,850
I love you

684
01:00:15,223 --> 01:00:18,262
I am happy to meet you after a long time

685
01:00:19,387 --> 01:00:21,035
Be happy

686
01:00:21,684 --> 01:00:23,145
I'll support you from now on

687
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:39,594
The complaint states that your husband SHINSUKE was unreasonable out of jealousy.

688
01:00:41,122 --> 01:00:44,817
do you know why he got jealous?

689
01:00:45,653 --> 01:00:46,325
No

690
01:00:47,192 --> 01:00:48,958
Do you know Mitsuharu Sugano?

691
01:00:50,856 --> 01:00:51,442
I know

692
01:00:51,661 --> 01:00:57,005
Last July, you visited him a lot while he was in the hospital.

693
01:00:57,635 --> 01:00:59,533
That's true

694
01:01:01,737 --> 01:01:08,760
But he had a special disease called amnesia.

695
01:01:09,516 --> 01:01:15,969
I was told by the doctor to come in for his treatment from time to time.

696
01:01:16,954 --> 01:01:23,821
I thought I could tell my husband about it and he would understand.

697
01:01:24,376 --> 01:01:29,141
If his illness is cured, you won't need to see him,right?

698
01:01:29,571 --> 01:01:29,962
No

699
01:01:30,173 --> 01:01:35,063
Have you had anything with him since last July?

700
01:01:35,368 --> 01:01:36,165
Right

701
01:01:36,376 --> 01:01:38,204
Have you never met him since then?

702
01:01:44,212 --> 01:01:49,314
You met him three days before September 15th.

703
01:01:52,635 --> 01:01:57,018
Machida 3-chome, Shinagawa-ku.
Shumpu apartment,Toki machida

704
01:01:57,784 --> 01:02:01,885
You met him and spent two hours in that room.

705
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:08,652
You went to Shinagawa station with him and shook hands on the platform and parted.

706
01:02:10,564 --> 01:02:11,744
Objection!

707
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:14,236
I ask her the truth

708
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:16,299
This is a leading question

709
01:02:16,324 --> 01:02:17,369
This is no!

710
01:02:17,394 --> 01:02:18,158
Be quiet

711
01:02:19,124 --> 01:02:20,405
Keep going

712
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,460
That'll be inconvenient

713
01:02:24,796 --> 01:02:25,663
I'm sorry

714
01:02:26,382 --> 01:02:33,834
I didn't know there was a detective.
It is inconvenient for me to be unfaithful

715
01:02:35,272 --> 01:02:37,600
It was not unfaithfulness

716
01:02:38,022 --> 01:02:38,944
Sorry

717
01:02:40,004 --> 01:02:43,293
you had better not see him for a while

718
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:45,449
I see

719
01:02:48,328 --> 01:02:50,492
what will happen to me?

720
01:02:50,758 --> 01:02:53,617
you have to prove his infidelity

721
01:02:55,156 --> 01:02:57,984
We have to find the address of ASAMI, the secretary.

722
01:02:58,828 --> 01:03:00,617
Leave it to me

723
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:06,609
If possible, I want to be by your side

724
01:03:07,258 --> 01:03:09,664
I don't care if I lose everything

725
01:03:11,476 --> 01:03:20,250
It didn't hold up well in court.
But I was very happy to meet you

726
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:26,774
do you remember when you were a student,Yoko?

727
01:03:27,766 --> 01:03:33,649
we were full of hope

728
01:03:35,174 --> 01:03:39,471
If you win the case we'll be back

729
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,947
We did not obligate ourselves to this matchmaking.

730
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:47,353
this was a natural match

731
01:03:47,994 --> 01:03:49,627
She was glad too

732
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:54,274
My case is not going in my favor.

733
01:03:55,493 --> 01:04:02,446
I feel so miserable when I see them

734
01:04:06,634 --> 01:04:09,688
I'm thinking of you all day long

735
01:04:10,985 --> 01:04:13,165
I'm about to go to Cambodia

736
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:17,887
I consider this work to be rewarding..but

737
01:04:18,629 --> 01:04:23,574
I don't know what to do if your case won't work well

738
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,024
I'm writing happy news today,Mitsuharu

739
01:04:30,328 --> 01:04:31,203
Asami?

740
01:04:32,055 --> 01:04:34,508
We've found her.
Your lawyer met her yesterday

741
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:37,057
Is that true?

742
01:04:37,432 --> 01:04:44,127
I contacted her home but no response.
I found her friend and got her contact

743
01:04:45,137 --> 01:04:51,051
She was working at bar.
Kanzaki lawyer found her

744
01:04:52,505 --> 01:04:57,137
I think our case will work well

745
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:02,059
I got express letter.
Asami will prove you?

746
01:05:02,364 --> 01:05:05,669
Kanzaki lawyer got promised with her

747
01:05:06,770 --> 01:05:09,153
Asami does not feel good about Sawano

748
01:05:09,801 --> 01:05:11,856
That is good news

749
01:05:13,466 --> 01:05:16,466
I will be in Tokyo to see you on the next court date.

750
01:05:17,067 --> 01:05:18,755
I think my lawyer will allow it.

751
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:21,809
I'm looking forward to it

752
01:05:23,887 --> 01:05:28,341
What? telephone bill will be high?
Ok see you then

753
01:05:29,544 --> 01:05:30,614
Hold on

754
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,137
Hi,I'm Chikako

755
01:05:36,442 --> 01:05:37,684
He hanged up the phone

756
01:05:38,374 --> 01:05:41,468
Witnesses must tell the truth.

757
01:05:42,397 --> 01:05:46,343
If you tell a lie, you are committing perjury.

758
01:05:51,326 --> 01:05:54,100
You speak to the presiding judge.

759
01:05:56,397 --> 01:05:59,201
Do you know Shinsuke Sawano?

760
01:05:59,858 --> 01:06:00,233
Yes

761
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:02,506
What relationship you have with him?

762
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:08,484
I was her secretary when I worked at Toyo metal co.

763
01:06:08,617 --> 01:06:09,625
When was it?

764
01:06:10,289 --> 01:06:13,187
It was between Feb to Oct last year

765
01:06:13,218 --> 01:06:14,195
I see

766
01:06:15,265 --> 01:06:20,414
Besides your work, you had a special relationship with him

767
01:06:21,592 --> 01:06:22,131
What?

768
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,295
I mean you were his mistress

769
01:06:24,912 --> 01:06:27,076
No way

770
01:06:27,756 --> 01:06:28,342
No?

771
01:06:30,709 --> 01:06:32,865
You didn't have such a relationship?

772
01:06:35,264 --> 01:06:36,084
No

773
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:44,607
You accompanied him on a business trip to Miyazaki last September.

774
01:06:46,396 --> 01:06:51,412
You stayed with him in a hotel for three days.

775
01:06:52,451 --> 01:06:52,967
Yes

776
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:55,810
Besides you, Was there another co workers?

777
01:06:56,732 --> 01:06:57,974
I was only the worker

778
01:06:58,857 --> 01:07:02,138
You did nothing to do with him?

779
01:07:02,865 --> 01:07:03,685
No

780
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:10,361
You eat and drink in the same room with him.

781
01:07:10,846 --> 01:07:12,971
I can call the maid as a witness.

782
01:07:19,176 --> 01:07:26,426
I felt lonely to eat alone, so I asked him to eat together

783
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,247
There was nothing happen more than that

784
01:07:32,083 --> 01:07:39,223
I met you at bar 1 week ago, 10/3.
You told me different

785
01:07:40,868 --> 01:07:42,407
I have no idea

786
01:07:42,493 --> 01:07:43,837
You should be honest

787
01:07:44,297 --> 01:07:45,914
Witnesses must tell the truth.

788
01:07:46,212 --> 01:07:49,516
presiding judge!
He insults the witness.

789
01:07:50,071 --> 01:07:50,829
Please reject

790
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:54,806
You watch your language.

791
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:56,040
I get it

792
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:01,591
What? She rejected?

793
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:03,419
I can't believe it

794
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:06,240
Kanzaki got in trouble

795
01:08:07,646 --> 01:08:09,130
We got in trouble

796
01:08:09,544 --> 01:08:13,130
I will go there to see her

797
01:08:13,482 --> 01:08:15,271
That's bad

798
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,786
It's not convenient for you to be here.

799
01:08:19,825 --> 01:08:22,450
I'll call you when the court is over

800
01:08:25,070 --> 01:08:29,312
She looks tired.
I will ask her a few questions

801
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:38,398
You changed your hotel 4th of your trip schedule

802
01:08:39,229 --> 01:08:39,721
Yes

803
01:08:40,362 --> 01:08:41,018
Why?

804
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:45,018
Niimua asked me to change my hotel

805
01:08:46,244 --> 01:08:51,526
Did you know Yoko Sawano visited him that day?

806
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,237
I found out it later

807
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:56,518
You didn't meet her that day?

808
01:08:57,642 --> 01:08:58,252
No

809
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,838
She backed in Tokyo,not saw her

810
01:09:01,853 --> 01:09:04,119
I met her

811
01:09:04,322 --> 01:09:05,088
When?

812
01:09:06,103 --> 01:09:08,306
Next day the morning

813
01:09:08,494 --> 01:09:09,908
Damn it.
She was bought up

814
01:09:11,654 --> 01:09:13,436
Oh morning.
Around what time?

815
01:09:14,318 --> 01:09:16,475
Around 5 am

816
01:09:16,795 --> 01:09:19,381
It was too early.
Why?

817
01:09:20,286 --> 01:09:22,068
I just walked around

818
01:09:23,255 --> 01:09:24,802
Then you met her?

819
01:09:27,068 --> 01:09:28,638
She was alone?

820
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:30,154
No

821
01:09:30,427 --> 01:09:32,044
With her husband?

822
01:09:32,505 --> 01:09:33,326
No

823
01:09:33,935 --> 01:09:35,411
She was another man

824
01:09:37,419 --> 01:09:38,599
Not husband

825
01:09:39,583 --> 01:09:41,216
What were they doing?

826
01:09:43,052 --> 01:09:46,083
They were sitting together and talk

827
01:09:46,372 --> 01:09:47,122
Like what?

828
01:09:47,818 --> 01:09:49,083
They seemed to be fun?

829
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:50,779
Yeah

830
01:09:52,005 --> 01:09:53,904
Oh no....

831
01:09:55,146 --> 01:09:59,966
She seemed to be crying

832
01:10:01,659 --> 01:10:06,791
The man seemed to encourage her

833
01:10:07,237 --> 01:10:09,807
It means, they were like lovers

834
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:14,377
presiding judge.
This is an inductive question, so please withdraw it.

835
01:10:14,916 --> 01:10:15,893
This is not

836
01:10:15,918 --> 01:10:16,713
presiding judge.

837
01:10:17,395 --> 01:10:20,372
Please withdraw your questioning.

838
01:10:20,887 --> 01:10:22,137
OK I will

839
01:10:23,465 --> 01:10:27,348
I ask you last question.
Do you know him?

840
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:32,419
I know

841
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:33,021
Who?

842
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:38,740
He is the architect MITSUHARU SUGANO

843
01:10:41,053 --> 01:10:42,209
Ok I finish

844
01:10:44,248 --> 01:10:46,271
Thank you

845
01:11:15,413 --> 01:11:17,835
Why you were lying?

846
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:28,408
You are making my year of hard work go to waste.

847
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:33,389
And moreover, I will be in big trouble for the rest of my life

848
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,936
My bad

849
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:39,864
Don't get angry

850
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,442
I would say Sawano paid you

851
01:11:46,169 --> 01:11:49,841
I won't blame about it

852
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:56,224
I want you to speak the truth.

853
01:11:56,957 --> 01:12:01,433
I am not righteous in your affair.

854
01:12:02,746 --> 01:12:06,840
I didn't do it.
Don't get me wrong

855
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:11,080
I want to divorce with him

856
01:12:11,955 --> 01:12:13,830
I wanna leave from him

857
01:12:15,057 --> 01:12:16,463
I know you love that man

858
01:12:18,057 --> 01:12:19,674
Do whatever you want

859
01:12:20,064 --> 01:12:22,205
You don't know what I feel

860
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:24,908
Yeah. you are happy woman

861
01:12:30,788 --> 01:12:32,381
It was fun Journey

862
01:12:34,366 --> 01:12:37,655
It was first time to get on plane

863
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:41,112
It happened just 1 year ago

864
01:12:53,722 --> 01:12:58,159
I don't care if you guys sue me

865
01:13:02,157 --> 01:13:09,486
You know what.
People want money when they are in trouble

866
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,441
Do you want to postpone your departure date?

867
01:13:18,918 --> 01:13:19,394
Yes

868
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:23,185
YOKO almost lost the case at trial.

869
01:13:23,474 --> 01:13:25,013
I can't leave here

870
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:30,912
I know what's in your mind but We've already arranged with our clients.

871
01:13:31,287 --> 01:13:35,678
I'm sorry to say this but Please turn me down.

872
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:39,394
Turn you down.
Don’t say bullshit

873
01:13:39,517 --> 01:13:42,832
I’m not in the mood to go

874
01:13:42,857 --> 01:13:46,336
this is an international job

875
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:50,968
I recommended you for this job instead of me

876
01:13:51,888 --> 01:13:54,254
Thank you, but

877
01:13:54,690 --> 01:14:00,460
I don't want you to mix women's issues with work either.

878
01:14:01,475 --> 01:14:04,812
What? 1 hour ago?

879
01:14:06,252 --> 01:14:07,703
We’re sorry

880
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:12,137
How was it?

881
01:14:12,162 --> 01:14:16,065
She said she left with a man an hour ago.

882
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:18,587
I think that man is Mitsuharu

883
01:14:19,112 --> 01:14:21,478
It's really bad for them to be together

884
01:14:21,534 --> 01:14:23,029
they are making the same mistake

885
01:14:23,175 --> 01:14:25,931
We are worried about them.
Where have they gone?

886
01:14:26,121 --> 01:14:27,248
I feel worry

887
01:14:27,273 --> 01:14:28,844
do you think they will commit suicide?

888
01:14:29,358 --> 01:14:31,634
Don't say bad joke

889
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:35,449
I think TOki worries about us

890
01:15:39,534 --> 01:15:40,940
I will not go to Cambodia

891
01:15:41,398 --> 01:15:44,009
You have to go

892
01:15:44,277 --> 01:15:46,811
I don't care if your lawyer gets mad at me

893
01:15:50,096 --> 01:15:52,150
What should I do?

894
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:54,248
You just stay with me

895
01:15:54,326 --> 01:16:01,431
If I lose the case, I will always be Sawano's wife.

896
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:06,018
Stop thinking about it,tonight

897
01:16:08,964 --> 01:16:09,723
Yes

898
01:16:30,151 --> 01:16:31,222
Hello

899
01:16:40,445 --> 01:16:42,030
No one here?

900
01:16:42,476 --> 01:16:44,630
He's still sleeping

901
01:16:47,733 --> 01:16:54,463
it's definitely this house.
It was snowing at that time and it was different from now

902
01:16:57,790 --> 01:17:00,045
I remember this house

903
01:17:08,936 --> 01:17:11,816
Yes. it's outside this window

904
01:17:14,048 --> 01:17:16,760
I proposed to you outside this window

905
01:17:24,936 --> 01:17:29,356
We were supposed to be happy

906
01:17:38,995 --> 01:17:42,667
Let's have fun today

907
01:17:44,864 --> 01:17:51,170
Forget everything until the sun goes down and then think about the future

908
01:17:52,487 --> 01:17:54,094
Yeah

909
01:19:59,939 --> 01:20:02,137
It's same with 3 years ago

910
01:20:04,867 --> 01:20:07,925
At the time they were singing in their cabin.

911
01:20:13,684 --> 01:20:18,438
we made a promise to get married outside the window

912
01:20:25,486 --> 01:20:27,673
Can you make a promise again?

913
01:20:30,285 --> 01:20:32,048
Please

914
01:20:34,142 --> 01:20:39,778
And as IMURA said, please go to Cambodia.

915
01:20:42,847 --> 01:20:43,550
Why?

916
01:20:44,164 --> 01:20:48,182
I will continue the trial

917
01:20:48,506 --> 01:20:50,448
I'll fight up to the supreme court

918
01:20:50,727 --> 01:20:51,720
Yoko

919
01:20:53,026 --> 01:20:58,673
I got courage from you

920
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:06,318
I will put up with not seeing you for half a year.

921
01:21:08,984 --> 01:21:13,080
please go to Cambodia.

922
01:21:14,174 --> 01:21:15,435
Thanks

923
01:21:17,098 --> 01:21:22,288
And Promise me again that you will marry me.

924
01:21:41,572 --> 01:21:44,050
You guys won't sleep

925
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:49,244
Day breaks soon.
We'll board the first train

926
01:21:49,791 --> 01:21:52,871
It's cold in the morning so please be careful

927
01:22:01,460 --> 01:22:03,067
2 more hours

928
01:22:05,087 --> 01:22:06,326
Mitsuharu

929
01:22:09,038 --> 01:22:13,737
Replace this in place of the ring.

930
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:33,620
We’re glad to be here

931
01:23:23,044 --> 01:23:26,560
Thanks

932
01:23:38,878 --> 01:23:39,927
Good morning

933
01:23:46,961 --> 01:23:49,662
I'm going to miss Judgment Day.

934
01:23:55,653 --> 01:23:56,490
Chikako

935
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:03,644
I wanted to say good bye

936
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:05,884
I had no time

937
01:24:08,283 --> 01:24:09,221
Chikako

938
01:24:21,785 --> 01:24:23,683
Get along well with Toki

939
01:24:31,401 --> 01:24:33,968
I hand down judgment No. 57

940
01:24:34,381 --> 01:24:36,736
Bros!

941
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:41,543
Good luck

942
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:47,313
I hand down judgment about Sawano Yoko and Shinsuke's case

943
01:24:48,477 --> 01:24:51,814
I dismiss plaintiff's claim

944
01:24:53,176 --> 01:24:55,252
Litigation costs shall be borne by the plaintiff

945
01:24:55,843 --> 01:25:01,290
Our court heard your opinions and made this decision.

946
01:25:16,519 --> 01:25:20,369
Good luck

947
01:25:28,703 --> 01:25:32,375
I'm sorry for my incompetence

948
01:25:35,054 --> 01:25:36,638
what are you going to do next?

949
01:25:38,298 --> 01:25:42,416
I will appeal the decision.

950
01:26:12,045 --> 01:26:13,987
I'm leaving here

951
01:26:14,333 --> 01:26:15,427
Thank you

952
01:27:09,705 --> 01:27:15,397
THE END

00:00:14,844 --> 00:00:24,703
Ninja in a Business Suit

3
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:56,683
Oh my god

4
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,557
Isomura Industrial Research Institute

5
00:02:33,318 --> 00:02:34,436
Good morning,everyone

6
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,186
You guys worked all night

7
00:02:39,757 --> 00:02:41,015
I'm back from Osaka now

8
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,296
welcome back

9
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:46,249
The work of this survey is very difficult, isn't it?

10
00:02:47,046 --> 00:02:49,069
We are doing a demand survey on the fan popularity list

11
00:02:50,077 --> 00:02:53,257
If we talk about fans in winter, people won't be interested in them.

12
00:02:55,368 --> 00:02:59,415
Each manufacturer is now taking measures for summer products

13
00:03:01,154 --> 00:03:04,568
We do our best to investigate and get only a profit of 30,000 yen

14
00:03:06,287 --> 00:03:09,716
This is an unprofitable business

15
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,552
Only big companies make money

16
00:03:15,169 --> 00:03:18,068
But we are subcontractors of big companies

17
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,787
Oh yeah,
How was your job in Osaka?

18
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,107
Did you get the money?

19
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,083
This is 100,000 yen.
This is a severance payment.

20
00:03:29,068 --> 00:03:32,998
It seems that a research company has also been established in Osaka.
So they don't need us anymore

21
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,200
I get paid, right?

22
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:38,825
You can pay the loan

23
00:03:40,012 --> 00:03:44,036
We'd be happy to get some money for the severance payment..

24
00:03:44,184 --> 00:03:46,239
That company is cold to us

25
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:52,598
If a big research company is established in Tokyo, we may go bankrupt

26
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:56,059
I may be dismissed

27
00:03:56,122 --> 00:04:00,872
Our president is a sucker for big business.

28
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,606
Watch the phone

29
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:04,668
I'm sorry

30
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:07,452
I'll answer

31
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,945
Hello?
This is Isomura Industrial Research Institute

32
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:14,468
What? Isomura is our president

33
00:04:19,038 --> 00:04:20,734
Oh...Yes

34
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,538
I see.
I'll go there right now

35
00:04:30,327 --> 00:04:30,859
What's wrong?

36
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,819
What's wrong with our president?

37
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:38,312
He died in a car accident

38
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:39,710
He died ?

39
00:04:40,359 --> 00:04:40,882
Where?

40
00:04:40,937 --> 00:04:41,804
At Nakasen-street

41
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,280
He was hit by a car

42
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,296
Call his daughter now,Furukawa

43
00:04:45,601 --> 00:04:48,460
I don't think she's at home

44
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,077
Let's find out where his daughter might be.

45
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,460
Verification please

46
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:16,695
He's your father, right?

47
00:05:18,343 --> 00:05:18,859
President

48
00:05:20,085 --> 00:05:22,148
Are you sure he is Shohei Isomura?

49
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,741
I'm sorry

50
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:32,109
These are his belongings.

51
00:05:37,116 --> 00:05:37,648
What's this?

52
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:41,023
It was in his jacket pocket

53
00:05:42,195 --> 00:05:43,601
It may have come in by chance

54
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:45,960
It ’s a dead leaf, is n’t it?

55
00:05:46,296 --> 00:05:47,648
This is a leaf of Shiiki

56
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,749
I thought I'd throw it away, but I took it

57
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,882
Can you keep it?

58
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,038
We keep this?

59
00:05:58,554 --> 00:06:01,726
Yes,I want to check this dead leaf

60
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,249
So please keep it as proof

61
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,616
keep it as proof?

62
00:06:06,827 --> 00:06:08,304
Yes,please

63
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:19,093
Please tell us a little more about the situation of the accident

64
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:26,327
According to the driver, he suddenly jumped out in front of the car.

65
00:06:26,937 --> 00:06:28,312
But I think this is his excuse

66
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:32,109
We've referred the driver for manslaughter.

67
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:36,624
He was also a speeding over 10km

68
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,413
I don't think this is a simple accidental death

69
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,116
I think it's a little strange that he dies in a car accident

70
00:06:44,023 --> 00:06:45,484
What do you mean?

71
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:51,843
For example, he may have been taken sleeping pills and taken out in front of the car

72
00:06:52,577 --> 00:06:54,734
Of course we also examined the inside of his stomach

73
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,718
There were no sleeping pills or alcohol in his stomach

74
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:05,148
There was only a little food left in his stomach

75
00:07:06,335 --> 00:07:08,601
His body seems to have been a little weak

76
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:13,062
Anyway don't think too much

77
00:07:26,953 --> 00:07:32,679
The president was very happy to go home

78
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:37,664
Why was he walking alone in that place?

79
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,687
He was walking alone on such a distant road in the middle of the rain.

80
00:07:47,093 --> 00:07:49,796
I can't understand why he walked that way

81
00:07:53,296 --> 00:07:55,554
About The dead leaves in his coat

82
00:07:56,398 --> 00:08:02,250
It seems that trees will die due to exhaust gas near the factory that makes TVs.

83
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,398
Maybe he was in a TV factory

84
00:08:09,898 --> 00:08:13,711
But there is no TV factory in that place

85
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:44,890
We will stop producing science TVs, right?

86
00:08:45,242 --> 00:08:47,773
It was officially decided at yesterday's meeting

87
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:53,695
The new TV we are releasing is called AH4

88
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,671
This TV is still in production and must be kept secret

89
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:03,257
As a means to do that

90
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:13,215
We tell the business industry that our new product is a 16 in flat-screen TV.

91
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:19,848
Keep secret until you are ready for mass production

92
00:09:24,254 --> 00:09:26,246
Hello? It's me

93
00:09:26,543 --> 00:09:27,629
Oh you

94
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:29,418
What?

95
00:09:31,356 --> 00:09:32,903
Ok, good

96
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:46,574
What's wrong? Machida

97
00:09:47,551 --> 00:09:50,020
I was contacted by a subordinate who was spying on Shindai Electric.

98
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,926
Mr.Tsumura

99
00:09:57,387 --> 00:09:58,020
What?

100
00:09:58,762 --> 00:09:59,801
Check that flowerpot.

101
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:01,864
Does it belong to our company?

102
00:10:02,098 --> 00:10:05,324
No,This is a borrow from the outside

103
00:10:05,926 --> 00:10:08,067
They come to replace once a week

104
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:31,606
This is a microphone

105
00:10:44,871 --> 00:10:46,840
This is a small dynamic microphone

106
00:10:46,981 --> 00:10:48,403
Why was this in a flowerpot?

107
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,528
What do you mean?

108
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:53,754
All our conversations are recorded

109
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:57,379
This is a product of Shingai Electric

110
00:10:57,922 --> 00:10:58,790
There is a spy

111
00:11:00,298 --> 00:11:05,423
I think it's a bad spy.
If I'm a spy I use the new radio

112
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:09,032
Anyway I will investigate this gardening company

113
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,376
And

114
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:13,501
I use this the other way around

115
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:14,548
You'll use?

116
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:19,907
We'll leave a recording of the lie conversation.

117
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:35,212
We will start mass production of 16-inch flat-screen TVs next year

118
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:37,204
That's good

119
00:11:37,611 --> 00:11:42,439
From now on, 14-in TVs will be replaced by 16-in TVs.

120
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:47,314
16 in TV information is still a secret in the industry, isn't it?

121
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,743
If they have a female spy,they'll know

122
00:11:51,251 --> 00:11:52,493
That's enough

123
00:11:53,711 --> 00:11:54,875
Good job,Kaneko

124
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:59,087
I gave money to a gardening company and put it on the bottom of the flowerpot.

125
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:02,798
16 in flat-screen TV is fine

126
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:10,680
If it is the same product, we outperform them in terms of capital and productivity.

127
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,454
But we mustn't let our guard down.
Find out until you have a solid confirmation

128
00:12:15,884 --> 00:12:16,283
OK?

129
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:16,970
Yes

130
00:12:17,439 --> 00:12:20,275
Japan's economy is being gobbled up by foreign capital.

131
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,884
This is the conclusion

132
00:12:23,548 --> 00:12:30,111
Even if it is a pure domestic product, We have to use foreign parts.

133
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,853
The future of the Japanese economy is also difficult.

134
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:39,689
Mr. Kazuo Kato, an economic commentator, visited us this morning.

135
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:45,079
We visited the house of Moriichi, a professor at the Doctor of Economics University.

136
00:12:45,212 --> 00:12:48,134
We talked to him about the future of the Japanese economy

137
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,243
I didn't notice that the front door was open

138
00:13:20,017 --> 00:13:22,439
Actually, I opened the front door when the TV sound came out

139
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,993
And I listened to the sound of the TV for a while

140
00:13:26,025 --> 00:13:30,274
You are awesome.
You're doing my best even if your father dies

141
00:13:30,704 --> 00:13:33,626
I'm trying hard to work hard and forget about misery

142
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:39,220
I’m here to pick you up.
Actually I got a cab so I feel it's better if someone go together

143
00:13:40,673 --> 00:13:44,001
The current TV program will continue for a long time, so please do your best

144
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:46,814
This is the bill

145
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:54,103
Here are the rent and food expenses

146
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:55,908
What can we do?

147
00:13:56,532 --> 00:13:57,430
What do you mean?

148
00:13:58,626 --> 00:14:00,837
Please extend the payment well

149
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:06,939
You know that this company doesn't have a job, right?

150
00:14:07,993 --> 00:14:09,376
I wonder if I will be freelance

151
00:14:10,275 --> 00:14:10,806
freelance?

152
00:14:11,837 --> 00:14:12,985
I'm going to be independent.

153
00:14:14,095 --> 00:14:20,728
I want to do a bigger job than being used as an employee

154
00:14:22,556 --> 00:14:23,345
See our president?

155
00:14:24,525 --> 00:14:28,876
He was killed to get a job

156
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:32,212
He did a lot to us

157
00:14:32,681 --> 00:14:33,392
Hey,Hinuma

158
00:14:35,634 --> 00:14:40,845
You think too much.
It has no confirmation

159
00:14:41,322 --> 00:14:42,658
I'm sure he was killed

160
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:47,572
I want to know what he's been looking into.

161
00:14:49,017 --> 00:14:52,228
I don't want to waste his death

162
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:57,267
We are just regular employees

163
00:14:58,243 --> 00:15:02,978
So for big companies it doesn't matter if any of us die

164
00:15:03,947 --> 00:15:04,915
But I don't like it

165
00:15:05,923 --> 00:15:10,524
If a big company wants to take advantage of us, we have to be strong

166
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,775
I take as much money as possible from big companies

167
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,118
Companies are trying to steal each other's trade secrets

168
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:21,970
They are trying to survive by all means

169
00:15:23,134 --> 00:15:24,501
We interrupt there

170
00:15:25,392 --> 00:15:27,673
Come here, Hinuma-san and Endo-san

171
00:15:27,931 --> 00:15:28,556
What's wrong?

172
00:15:28,673 --> 00:15:29,376
There is a big news

173
00:15:29,603 --> 00:15:30,376
Come on, Endo-san

174
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,509
We are like mice

175
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:36,728
What's wrong?

176
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:50,908
She is my lover Takako Kume, a telephone operator of Sanesu Electric.

177
00:15:53,126 --> 00:15:54,189
Tell them yesterday's story

178
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:01,533
Sanesu Electric will release a new TV called AH4 next year

179
00:16:04,462 --> 00:16:05,470
AH4?

180
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:06,603
What kind of tv is it

181
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:09,579
I just listened to the manager's phone

182
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:11,884
I don't know for sure.

183
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:17,603
But it seems to be a revolutionary new product

184
00:16:18,689 --> 00:16:19,376
Is that all?

185
00:16:22,056 --> 00:16:25,337
Remember that story more.
I'll love you tonight

186
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,759
AH4

187
00:16:44,329 --> 00:16:46,150
Let's go together

188
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:47,947
I want to go to Kumagaya

189
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:49,118
Go with me?

190
00:16:49,634 --> 00:16:54,275
I would like to find out what the president tell Shinkai Denki.

191
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:03,712
If I go to Kumagaya, I think there are some clues

192
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:06,572
Sorry for the inconvenience

193
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:11,814
This is natural because it is for the president

194
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:14,712
I'm Akiko

195
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,517
So Akiko-san

196
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,173
You also had a lot of trouble

197
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,314
Please relax for a while

198
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:50,915
How about moving from Tokyo?

199
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,908
I can't. because I have to work

200
00:17:53,501 --> 00:17:57,540
This area is noisy these days unlike in the past

201
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:03,993
By the way,When the president came here, did you notice any changes in him?

202
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:05,665
About my brother?

203
00:18:06,603 --> 00:18:07,892
Let me see

204
00:18:08,939 --> 00:18:09,868
Nothing in particular

205
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,126
Let me see

206
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:14,993
It was just a little weird when he return

207
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:16,298
What happened?

208
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:20,345
There was just a TV survey that day

209
00:18:21,189 --> 00:18:21,751
TV?

210
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,547
What did they come to investigate

211
00:18:24,836 --> 00:18:27,750
They asked us What do you want for your second TV?

212
00:18:28,187 --> 00:18:30,374
They brought a paper

213
00:18:31,093 --> 00:18:33,750
So I answered the survey.

214
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,289
I had a brother, and that became a problem.

215
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,961
My brother is an expert, so I've entrusted him with the investigation.

216
00:18:43,898 --> 00:18:47,672
My brother looked at the paper and had a troubled face

217
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:50,812
He came home with the paper

218
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,484
I couldn't find that paper among his belongings for sure

219
00:18:59,351 --> 00:19:01,859
What question was written on the paper?

220
00:19:02,195 --> 00:19:07,453
I'm too dumb to remember a few things.

221
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:18,523
The paper was immediately collected by the investigator.

222
00:19:18,945 --> 00:19:22,711
Information on the size of the TV was written on that paper

223
00:19:23,539 --> 00:19:27,968
They told me to check my favorite TV

224
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:32,859
Which one did you check

225
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,883
I checked 4 inch TV

226
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:37,468
4 inch TV?

227
00:19:37,922 --> 00:19:42,218
4 inch TV is like this size

228
00:19:42,773 --> 00:19:46,758
This is a TV that is too small so I checked this because it is interesting

229
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:49,125
Thanks

230
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:58,523
There was a TV that could be removed in the car

231
00:19:58,695 --> 00:19:59,797
I checked that

232
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:04,914
It's cool we can watch TV in the car

233
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:08,867
It's the worst if I watch TV and have a traffic accident

234
00:20:11,312 --> 00:20:13,656
I knew what he was investigating

235
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,671
A manufacturer is trying to develop a micro TV

236
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:22,343
He cough this information

237
00:20:23,297 --> 00:20:26,578
If I look this up, I'll know.

238
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,492
You can also see why he died

239
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:35,906
Thank you very much for thinking about my father

240
00:20:37,195 --> 00:20:38,492
But he died

241
00:20:39,601 --> 00:20:43,500
I think he can finally sleep because he was so busy

242
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,554
Can you leave him alone?

243
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:54,234
I will not forgive anyone who lives without guilt.
I need to find out why he dead

244
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:57,804
I can't forgive them

245
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,383
Anyway I'll return to Tokyo

246
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,336
And then we'll have a meeting to figure out what to do.

247
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,531
Hi I want to eat Ramen

248
00:21:22,101 --> 00:21:24,484
No,
I have a lot of bills

249
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:25,695
How much?

250
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,539
He is hungry.
Order ramen for him

251
00:21:31,437 --> 00:21:35,304
I paid for the train so I don't have any money anymore.
so Please

252
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:36,906
You can be good wife

253
00:21:37,617 --> 00:21:40,133
I'm disgusted with this life

254
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,672
Ok.let's go for eating

255
00:21:43,406 --> 00:21:45,703
I'll pay in cash

256
00:22:01,562 --> 00:22:02,984
Let's eat

257
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,156
Is it a 4-inch small TV that can be attached to a car?

258
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:10,062
Is it possible to develop?

259
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,695
The president happened to get the survey form and let the company know.

260
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:16,406
Someone who knew it killed him?

261
00:22:17,273 --> 00:22:17,883
Maybe

262
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,648
But do they kill people to get the survey form?

263
00:22:22,289 --> 00:22:25,492
The president may have found the factory

264
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:29,546
There was a leaf in his pocket that was dead from the exhaust gas

265
00:22:31,046 --> 00:22:32,343
But there is no clue

266
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:38,335
For that matter, let's find out the connection between Han-chan's girlfriend's new TV and this Kumagai.

267
00:22:38,828 --> 00:22:41,382
Why don't you use that to blackmail 3S Electric?

268
00:22:41,961 --> 00:22:47,804
But everything is just speculation.
That much information is not enough

269
00:22:48,421 --> 00:22:50,968
If my intuition is right, I will make a lot of profits

270
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:53,265
Let's do it without fear of failure.

271
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:02,070
This is 3S electric

272
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,022
I’m Machida

273
00:23:18,381 --> 00:23:19,077
Nice to meet you

274
00:23:21,225 --> 00:23:21,850
Take your seat

275
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,249
What can I do for you?

276
00:23:30,092 --> 00:23:37,342
I heard that your new product in the industry is a 16-inch flat-screen TV

277
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:39,092
Oh I see

278
00:23:39,928 --> 00:23:40,725
In fact

279
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:45,569
Someone said your new product is different

280
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:47,545
Oh I see

281
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:50,897
Go ahead

282
00:23:51,397 --> 00:23:56,327
Your new product is an ultra-compact TV that can be used in a car, right?

283
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,990
Oh I see

284
00:24:02,288 --> 00:24:03,577
I'll be frank with you.

285
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:08,850
If you don't buy this information we're going to sell this information

286
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,405
For example, to Chugai electric

287
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,983
That's fine

288
00:24:13,139 --> 00:24:13,600
So?

289
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:14,295
So what?

290
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:14,897
Do you buy?

291
00:24:15,936 --> 00:24:16,772
No

292
00:24:20,561 --> 00:24:24,733
Such an ultra-small TV cannot be made with the current Japanese technology.

293
00:24:25,725 --> 00:24:27,866
Your engineers are very good

294
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:32,819
I think no one will buy it even if we sell it

295
00:24:33,827 --> 00:24:36,131
Other electronics companies are not stupid

296
00:24:37,514 --> 00:24:41,147
we're negotiating with you because it's technically possible

297
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,124
You sure?

298
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,522
Let me listen

299
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:53,655
Talk about it for our technology improvement

300
00:24:55,788 --> 00:24:57,131
I can't say that easily

301
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:58,702
So up to you

302
00:25:00,772 --> 00:25:01,897
I have a meeting so excuse me for this

303
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:06,350
People like you sometimes visit me

304
00:25:07,303 --> 00:25:12,256
But I didn't have time to talk to them

305
00:25:12,397 --> 00:25:13,108
Wait a min

306
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,920
Please contact me if you want to hear the continuation of the story

307
00:25:19,647 --> 00:25:20,452
We look forward

308
00:25:20,803 --> 00:25:23,092
Please hand over your business card to the secretary

309
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,256
Isn't it difficult to develop an ultra-small TV?

310
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:51,295
We have to bet on it.

311
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:55,725
We haven't heard from 3S Denki since then.

312
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,467
Is there a company that needs such a TV even though the market is so small?

313
00:26:00,847 --> 00:26:03,652
Development of a new refrigerator in 1963

314
00:26:04,769 --> 00:26:06,738
No research work comes in

315
00:26:07,449 --> 00:26:12,230
We should have subcontracted for the company like our president did.

316
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,730
Who are you guys?

317
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:39,199
Why you are here?

318
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:42,254
Is this an industrial research office?

319
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:45,746
Yes, and you?

320
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:49,979
We just came here to say hello

321
00:26:50,394 --> 00:26:51,316
say hello?

322
00:27:02,496 --> 00:27:03,316
What the hell

323
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:11,574
Stop it

324
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:14,933
Who are you guys?

325
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,495
We just came here to play

326
00:27:19,019 --> 00:27:20,730
We wanted you to see this hunting gun

327
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,863
We just hit a little,
Stay down

328
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:27,441
Are you ok,Hinuma?

329
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:30,652
Damn it

330
00:27:31,394 --> 00:27:34,011
The police these days understand us well

331
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:37,863
I can say that I went out of control when I was playing with a hunting gun

332
00:27:38,003 --> 00:27:43,159
All you have to do is ask me if I'll pay for it myself, or if I'll serve a year in jail for injury.

333
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:46,769
I will get bail by the way

334
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:49,230
Who did you ask?

335
00:27:49,691 --> 00:27:50,535
Listen

336
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:53,504
You guys should quit this job

337
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:57,300
This world is not so easy.

338
00:27:58,168 --> 00:27:58,449
Listen

339
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:00,261
You guys should quit this job

340
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:01,394
You understand?

341
00:28:02,308 --> 00:28:03,230
We understand

342
00:28:04,511 --> 00:28:05,863
I just have to quit my job, right?

343
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,668
That's right.
I'm okay if you understand

344
00:28:11,175 --> 00:28:12,886
Can I smoke?

345
00:28:13,129 --> 00:28:15,511
This is not in the subway.
Smoke as much as you want

346
00:28:19,496 --> 00:28:21,910
Everyone will go home

347
00:28:34,449 --> 00:28:35,910
They hit us.
Damn it

348
00:28:37,144 --> 00:28:38,636
Everything goes wrong

349
00:28:39,144 --> 00:28:40,035
Listen

350
00:28:41,097 --> 00:28:43,269
This is 3S electric's reply

351
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:46,527
They want us to keep our mouths shut.

352
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:51,168
In short,
The information on the micro TV was true

353
00:28:52,668 --> 00:28:53,957
My intuition seems to be right

354
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,316
Let's look behind them

355
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:00,097
We'll definitely find someone who is using them

356
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:02,660
The answer is this cigarette lighter.

357
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,386
This is a cigarette lighter camera

358
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:07,707
I've made up my mind.

359
00:29:08,636 --> 00:29:10,613
If we're quiet, they'll just use us.

360
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:13,917
I'm angry at companies that use sneaky means

361
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:16,597
They use Yakuza

362
00:29:17,129 --> 00:29:20,738
If we identify them, we will get a lot of rewards.

363
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,215
Hey, Hinuma

364
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,082
I found out what they were

365
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:55,019
He is a former yakuza named Fukai

366
00:29:55,363 --> 00:29:58,402
Recently he has been hired by Taiyo research company, Uehara.

367
00:29:59,027 --> 00:30:00,035
Taiyo research company?

368
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:02,879
I haven't investigated this company yet

369
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,496
It's a one-year-old company

370
00:30:06,074 --> 00:30:08,300
I still don't know which company is affiliated

371
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:10,933
Let's go to the company immediately

372
00:30:13,097 --> 00:30:15,496
But I don't think they say anything when they get in there

373
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,199
We'll have to stake it out for a while.

374
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,730
Can I borrow your friend’s car,Han-Chan?

375
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:26,879
Can you ask your friend?

376
00:31:06,348 --> 00:31:07,465
He is trying make a call

377
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:09,598
Oh to noodle shop

378
00:31:10,855 --> 00:31:14,652
Are you Sakashita noodle?
This is Taiyo search

379
00:31:15,223 --> 00:31:17,332
I want a order a noodle

380
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:19,012
He is stingy

381
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,887
Don't say bullish

382
00:31:22,223 --> 00:31:24,043
I'll switch with you.

383
00:31:25,637 --> 00:31:27,660
Wait. Fukaya is coming

384
00:31:58,387 --> 00:31:59,934
Now we have proof that they attacked us.

385
00:32:28,754 --> 00:32:30,090
Oh shit!

386
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:31,262
He found us?

387
00:32:31,848 --> 00:32:32,738
Never mind

388
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:34,394
He originally has that kind of eyes

389
00:32:35,449 --> 00:32:36,660
I'll switch with you.

390
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:46,316
If he goes somewhere, ask you to go

391
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:50,191
I and Han-Chan try to kidnap Uehara and threaten him

392
00:32:50,574 --> 00:32:52,285
Oh my god

393
00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:53,285
What's wrong?

394
00:32:56,754 --> 00:32:58,934
The soba shop really brought the soba

395
00:32:59,465 --> 00:33:01,621
Mr. Hinuma's telepathy is wonderful.

396
00:33:10,105 --> 00:33:11,512
Hey,Hinuma,Handa!

397
00:33:13,848 --> 00:33:14,707
Uehara will go out

398
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,012
Uehara-san

399
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,754
You are Mr. Uehara of the Taiyo Research Center,right?

400
00:33:44,457 --> 00:33:45,379
Who are you guys?

401
00:33:45,535 --> 00:33:46,473
We are here to pick up you

402
00:33:46,957 --> 00:33:47,457
Pick up me?

403
00:33:48,324 --> 00:33:48,684
Who ask?

404
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:49,543
A company

405
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:52,519
I can't say any more.
This is urgent

406
00:33:52,934 --> 00:33:54,215
Please get in the car

407
00:34:04,316 --> 00:34:06,980
Who are you?
Why did you come in without permission?

408
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:07,816
Where is Uehara?

409
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,449
My boss?
He's just gone out

410
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:13,285
Oh I'm sorry

411
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:18,519
Who are you?

412
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:20,730
I'm Yasuoka from 3S electric

413
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:22,754
Oh you are from 3S

414
00:34:23,207 --> 00:34:24,504
I was very sorry

415
00:34:24,894 --> 00:34:25,566
Can I wait for him here?

416
00:34:25,754 --> 00:34:26,168
Sure

417
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,449
I'll make a tea for you

418
00:35:00,457 --> 00:35:00,863
Here it is

419
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,582
Thanks

420
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:03,668
Oh shit

421
00:35:04,316 --> 00:35:05,824
I forgot....

422
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:06,262
Eh?

423
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,816
I'm out of cigarettes

424
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:09,746
I have some

425
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:10,918
Please

426
00:35:11,129 --> 00:35:13,652
I like cigarettes with a filter

427
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:14,996
I'll buy it for you

428
00:35:15,285 --> 00:35:16,074
Oh, thanks

429
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:17,941
Here it is

430
00:35:18,668 --> 00:35:19,800
High light or hope,right?

431
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:20,348
Yes

432
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:43,479
TV penetration survey card

433
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:53,947
Please wait a moment

434
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:54,917
Get off of me

435
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:58,167
Why did you guys bring me here?

436
00:36:59,112 --> 00:37:02,979
Do you have any idea if we are person from Isomura Industrial Research Institute?

437
00:37:07,182 --> 00:37:08,807
It seems you know something

438
00:37:09,182 --> 00:37:09,932
What the hell

439
00:37:10,487 --> 00:37:11,784
Don't pretend you don't know

440
00:37:12,534 --> 00:37:14,839
I also investigated your relationship with the yakuza Fukai

441
00:37:15,792 --> 00:37:17,885
I also took a picture of where you give him money

442
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,479
Be honest.

443
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:22,768
What the hell

444
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:25,425
The attack on our office was probably ordered by the 3S Corporation.

445
00:37:25,698 --> 00:37:26,214
Say it

446
00:37:26,354 --> 00:37:28,042
Hit you if you don't say

447
00:37:33,534 --> 00:37:33,964
No

448
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,089
So why you did it?

449
00:37:37,018 --> 00:37:40,081
The fewer peers, the better.

450
00:37:40,612 --> 00:37:42,073
Forgive me

451
00:37:42,464 --> 00:37:43,464
I will get along with you guys

452
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:44,823
Don't cheat

453
00:37:46,245 --> 00:37:48,604
Who asked you? 3S right?

454
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,948
Say it

455
00:37:50,456 --> 00:37:52,378
I can not breathe.
Get off of me

456
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:55,510
I'm a 3S electricity research company

457
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,917
Your company had a beef with 3S Electric, so I helped them out.

458
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:04,104
I was willing to help them

459
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:10,034
This is the perfect place to blackmail you.
No one hear us

460
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:12,167
Confess more

461
00:38:12,706 --> 00:38:15,940
Your company was asked by 3S in Kumagaya to investigate,right?

462
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:22,714
President Isomura of our company saw the survey form and learned that 3S Electric will develop a new ultra-compact TV.

463
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,612
He found the factory

464
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:27,815
The president tried to inform Chugai Electric of the information

465
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,698
You knew it and killed him

466
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:33,714
You pushed him in front of the running truck

467
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,706
I don't know about him

468
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,909
I just did a survey

469
00:38:39,846 --> 00:38:40,807
I don't know anymore

470
00:38:41,901 --> 00:38:42,862
Trust me

471
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:44,885
Say it

472
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,596
I know you can't say you killed a person

473
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,979
Don't you want to die?

474
00:38:51,964 --> 00:38:53,596
Where is the factory?

475
00:38:54,128 --> 00:38:54,753
I don't know

476
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,416
I don't know

477
00:38:58,135 --> 00:38:59,268
Say it!

478
00:38:59,995 --> 00:39:02,753
It's true that 3S Electric is making ultra-compact TVs, isn't it?

479
00:39:04,729 --> 00:39:06,643
It's no use asking me that

480
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,456
I forgive you for this today.

481
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:19,643
But prove your crime and make sure you are arrested

482
00:39:20,917 --> 00:39:21,417
Let's go

483
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:02,861
I feel really stuck.

484
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:06,307
A person named Hinuma is chasing me

485
00:40:07,503 --> 00:40:09,511
They have threatened me

486
00:40:10,816 --> 00:40:11,972
Damn it

487
00:40:15,347 --> 00:40:16,644
By the Hinuma?

488
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:20,917
He also noticed that I killed Isomura

489
00:40:22,206 --> 00:40:23,566
we're in danger.

490
00:40:24,097 --> 00:40:26,456
It's none of my business

491
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:28,527
Give me a break

492
00:40:29,284 --> 00:40:33,784
I killed Isomura for your company

493
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,027
It was my failure for Isomura to learn about my Kumagaya investigation.

494
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:45,144
If other companies know the results of that survey, you will be in great trouble.

495
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,417
I didn't ask you killed him

496
00:40:48,878 --> 00:40:50,652
It's your business

497
00:40:51,738 --> 00:40:54,519
Then I have an idea too

498
00:40:55,097 --> 00:40:56,120
Calm down

499
00:40:57,511 --> 00:40:59,097
I'll check on his movements.

500
00:41:00,675 --> 00:41:04,292
He seems to know the daughter of Mr. Isomura who died

501
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,839
Now we know for sure that 3S Electric is developing an ultra compact TV.

502
00:41:20,816 --> 00:41:24,777
Let's go directly to the factory and find out the secret of the product

503
00:41:25,659 --> 00:41:26,597
And let's talk to 3S Electric

504
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,183
Let's check the factory

505
00:41:29,761 --> 00:41:32,691
But one of their four factories

506
00:41:33,034 --> 00:41:34,386
Maybe there is a secret factory

507
00:41:35,597 --> 00:41:37,558
Maybe it's in the neighborhood of the president's parents' house

508
00:41:38,628 --> 00:41:41,878
However, there is no such factory in Kumagaya

509
00:41:45,363 --> 00:41:45,863
Let's do this

510
00:41:47,034 --> 00:41:48,612
You should look for a parts drafting manufacturer

511
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:53,214
If it's a micro-TV, there should be a lot of parts on order.

512
00:41:53,831 --> 00:41:55,980
The delivery destination is their secret factory

513
00:41:56,706 --> 00:41:57,237
And another one

514
00:41:58,034 --> 00:41:59,159
Find out their engineers

515
00:42:00,605 --> 00:42:04,003
Probably a lot of engineers are working for this product

516
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:07,784
They may be in the factory

517
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:09,714
That might be in captivity

518
00:42:11,113 --> 00:42:13,167
Ok, I'll do it with Handa

519
00:42:14,878 --> 00:42:16,902
I'll find whoever killed the president.

520
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:21,613
I'm sure we'll find the people at the big corporations who ordered it.

521
00:42:22,347 --> 00:42:23,355
Leave the rest work to you

522
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,800
Let's do it tomorrow morning,Han-Chan

523
00:42:28,769 --> 00:42:29,433
Endo-san

524
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,941
Can I borrow some money?

525
00:42:33,144 --> 00:42:35,089
I feel like drinking a little

526
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,058
only you?

527
00:42:38,292 --> 00:42:39,565
Never mind

528
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:41,909
I give you

529
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,941
I'll have it

530
00:42:44,966 --> 00:42:45,847
Are you going to date with someone?

531
00:42:47,386 --> 00:42:48,120
Don't say bullshit

532
00:42:50,378 --> 00:42:53,495
Please use the electric blanket of Chugai Electric

533
00:42:54,058 --> 00:42:57,542
World-famous Chugai Electric

534
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:59,430
Chugai Electric

535
00:43:04,863 --> 00:43:05,488
Who is it?

536
00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:07,925
I'm hinuma

537
00:43:15,628 --> 00:43:17,175
Sorry I'm drunk

538
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,800
What time is it now?

539
00:43:22,206 --> 00:43:24,472
it's still 8 pm,
Please come in

540
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:27,503
Thank you

541
00:43:33,816 --> 00:43:36,417
I'm here to talk with you something

542
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:45,824
Your dad was looking up information about 3S electricity

543
00:43:47,034 --> 00:43:47,800
3S's?

544
00:43:48,128 --> 00:43:51,199
He died on the way to inform Chugai Denki of the information

545
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:55,761
Perhaps he was killed by the pressure of 3S Electric

546
00:43:56,988 --> 00:43:58,355
Did you find the evidence?

547
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:02,042
Still treated as a traffic accident

548
00:44:03,386 --> 00:44:07,300
But I will definitely find the culprit

549
00:44:08,222 --> 00:44:14,097
To achieve this, I will definitely find a factory for ultra-small TVs.

550
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:17,300
Don't push yourself too hard

551
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,518
I worry about you

552
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:23,449
I'm very worried because you are so serious

553
00:44:25,034 --> 00:44:27,308
You take good care of yourself

554
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:28,652
Akiko-san

555
00:44:29,402 --> 00:44:32,574
I also want to live a life in peace

556
00:44:33,675 --> 00:44:36,667
You will understand me someday

557
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:43,652
Behind every great product there is a black shadow.

558
00:44:44,784 --> 00:44:48,331
Your father is the victim

559
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:53,589
I don't mind being called a poisonous mouse

560
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:56,613
They are dirty than me

561
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,566
They are willing to kill people for the benefit of the company

562
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:05,620
I can't forgive them

563
00:45:11,284 --> 00:45:12,011
Then

564
00:45:12,628 --> 00:45:13,878
I'm going home

565
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,449
See you

566
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:44,878
We make glass for CRTs in 3S electric

567
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:49,667
But such small TV glasses haven't been ordered by them

568
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:50,886
I see

569
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:57,933
It is said that it is difficult to produce CRT glass in-house.

570
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:02,784
Ordinary glass is fine as long as the quantity is about the prototype.

571
00:46:03,978 --> 00:46:08,721
So it's conceivable that a manufacturer could make CRT glass in their own factory.

572
00:46:08,746 --> 00:46:11,925
Yes,they can do it if you make a small facility

573
00:46:18,089 --> 00:46:21,628
Certainly there was a patent application for a television transistor this spring

574
00:46:22,425 --> 00:46:23,745
Who applied for it?

575
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:26,902
Mr. Matsushima, a semiconductor expert

576
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:28,808
Lecturer at Toyo Institute of Technology

577
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,933
Is it an individual, not a company?

578
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:32,417
Yes

579
00:46:32,442 --> 00:46:33,027
But

580
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:39,136
Is this an individual study?

581
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:42,120
This is a very advanced content, isn't it?

582
00:46:42,824 --> 00:46:43,519
maybe

583
00:46:44,144 --> 00:46:51,456
For example, is it possible that some company is pretending to be an individual?

584
00:46:52,542 --> 00:46:53,253
maybe

585
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:58,183
The content and design of the invention are necessary for the application procedure, right?

586
00:46:58,738 --> 00:46:59,738
maybe

587
00:47:00,316 --> 00:47:01,589
Can I see it?

588
00:47:02,589 --> 00:47:03,589
maybe

589
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:11,120
The intelligence agencies of each manufacturer always ask us

590
00:47:12,519 --> 00:47:14,660
They come up with a lot of money and we get very upset.

591
00:47:15,902 --> 00:47:19,175
If we cooperate with them, Japanese companies will only make a mess.

592
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:20,675
Does it make sense?

593
00:47:27,066 --> 00:47:29,206
Mr.Matsushima is in USA now

594
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,746
He went there around the beginning of January.

595
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:32,831
To USA?

596
00:47:36,277 --> 00:47:42,238
Is there anyone doing the same research as him?

597
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,089
Do you know?

598
00:47:44,425 --> 00:47:47,128
Yes,Taskahata,
He is an engineer in 3S electric

599
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:48,660
3S's?

600
00:47:50,605 --> 00:47:52,675
Where is he living?

601
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:55,136
Ok, wait a min

602
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:01,753
Here is his resume

603
00:48:02,886 --> 00:48:03,394
Thanks

604
00:48:28,464 --> 00:48:30,441
May I ask you something?

605
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:31,136
What?

606
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:34,542
Is the person living across the street a 3S electric person?

607
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:36,089
Yes he is the engineer

608
00:48:36,386 --> 00:48:38,839
He is now in usa for research

609
00:48:39,277 --> 00:48:39,917
To USA?

610
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:42,480
Yes he's gone around January

611
00:48:43,019 --> 00:48:44,636
He left his newly-married wife

612
00:48:45,113 --> 00:48:46,441
That's too bad

613
00:48:46,871 --> 00:48:49,871
Her wife is a person who doesn't go out much

614
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:54,979
But she goes out early on Sunday morning and comes back late at night

615
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:57,847
Sunday,right?
Thanks

616
00:49:00,035 --> 00:49:00,722
Let's go

617
00:50:41,392 --> 00:50:42,720
He is Takahata

618
00:50:43,166 --> 00:50:46,799
The engineer is actually confined under the excuse of traveling to the United States

619
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:48,401
I see

620
00:50:52,369 --> 00:50:55,244
If we follow him, you'll know the location of the secret factory.

621
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:56,752
I think it'll work fine

622
00:50:57,127 --> 00:51:00,213
The trade secrets of large companies can be understood thanks to the young couple.

623
00:51:00,955 --> 00:51:03,947
No one can beat humanity, can they?

624
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:06,799
Thank you Mr. and Mrs. Takahata

625
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,104
Humans are wonderful!

626
00:51:11,095 --> 00:51:11,892
Let's go

627
00:51:31,345 --> 00:51:32,525
Are you jealous?

628
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:35,806
I want to meet more comfortably

629
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,330
They probably stay out

630
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:39,244
What should we do?

631
00:51:39,353 --> 00:51:40,549
We'll stay out too

632
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:41,501
Do you have enough money?

633
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:42,908
Of course not

634
00:51:43,924 --> 00:51:45,931
Your watch is made in Switzerland, isn't it?

635
00:51:46,556 --> 00:51:47,760
I need to say good bye to my watch

636
00:51:47,923 --> 00:51:50,610
If I put it in a pawn shop in Kumagaya, I can't easily come to pick it up

637
00:51:50,635 --> 00:51:51,627
We'll come often

638
00:51:52,095 --> 00:51:52,923
Let's go

639
00:52:44,181 --> 00:52:45,916
Is this the secret factory of 3S?

640
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:48,892
It doesn't look like that

641
00:52:53,885 --> 00:52:54,525
That's it

642
00:52:55,252 --> 00:52:56,549
The president had that dead leaf

643
00:52:57,806 --> 00:52:58,830
It must be here

644
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:07,103
It must be here

645
00:53:08,392 --> 00:53:09,502
The leaves are dead, right?

646
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:13,330
This is due to the chlorine produced for semiconductor manufacturing

647
00:53:19,861 --> 00:53:20,947
Can you hear something?

648
00:53:21,205 --> 00:53:21,861
What?

649
00:53:22,697 --> 00:53:23,994
I hear strange sounds

650
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:26,838
Yes I can hear

651
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,228
It's like the sound of water

652
00:53:29,253 --> 00:53:32,900
It ’s the sound of cleaning to make semiconductors.

653
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:35,955
So must be here

654
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,244
Here they are making a micro TV

655
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:44,205
Ok Let's check it out

656
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,377
How can we go inside?

657
00:54:25,127 --> 00:54:26,470
Let's go back today

658
00:54:26,939 --> 00:54:28,564
We should make a plan and come here again

659
00:54:46,267 --> 00:54:47,791
Do you worry about Hinuma?

660
00:54:48,275 --> 00:54:48,720
What?

661
00:54:48,838 --> 00:54:50,572
What does he do lately?

662
00:54:50,783 --> 00:54:54,400
I don't know well but he is checking around about 3S electric

663
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,049
Oh 3S's

664
00:54:57,095 --> 00:55:01,150
As an employee of Chugai Electric, I'm curious about that information.

665
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:03,908
What exactly is that information?

666
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:08,752
It seems to be the secret of a micro TV

667
00:55:09,424 --> 00:55:11,017
He always does dangerous things

668
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:14,556
He may go to the 3S factory

669
00:55:15,205 --> 00:55:17,627
Oh I get it

670
00:55:18,923 --> 00:55:22,197
I want to help him but

671
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,127
Let me know if something happen on him

672
00:55:27,087 --> 00:55:28,673
I want to help him

673
00:55:29,767 --> 00:55:34,916
According to the story of Isomura's daughter,Hinuma is checking around about 3S electric

674
00:55:36,135 --> 00:55:38,635
Of course, the security of the factory is strict.

675
00:55:39,705 --> 00:55:41,361
Please cooperate with me too

676
00:55:43,181 --> 00:55:45,353
Our purpose is corporate defense

677
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:49,080
First, keep them away from the factory.

678
00:55:49,924 --> 00:55:53,900
Even if they find a factory, it is difficult to enter the factory.

679
00:55:55,095 --> 00:55:58,197
So you must absolutely prevent them from entering.

680
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:39,517
I scoured the fire department and the electric company to get a floor plan of this plant.

681
00:56:39,916 --> 00:56:42,806
I see. Well, so We will be fire station staff

682
00:56:43,994 --> 00:56:45,431
Can you do it well?

683
00:56:46,244 --> 00:56:47,189
Leave it to me

684
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,267
I'm good at making certificates since I was a student

685
00:56:51,377 --> 00:56:55,502
I made a graduation certificate and even a salary statement

686
00:56:56,502 --> 00:56:57,916
I helped many people

687
00:56:59,142 --> 00:57:02,181
I'm glad this talent of mine is being put to use.

688
00:57:06,181 --> 00:57:06,806
Good job

689
00:57:41,986 --> 00:57:45,799
It was information that 3 S electric is making a 16-inch TV but

690
00:57:46,447 --> 00:57:50,619
It seems that there is no such thing even if we check the parts factory

691
00:57:51,814 --> 00:57:56,119
Maybe they are developing another product

692
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:57,267
Soga-kun

693
00:57:57,838 --> 00:57:58,853
Do you have any information for that?

694
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:03,119
I'm collecting that information but..

695
00:58:03,267 --> 00:58:08,939
The information on the 16-inch TV we are developing has already become public.

696
00:58:09,635 --> 00:58:10,861
What the hell is this?

697
00:58:13,345 --> 00:58:15,025
It ’s better to steal than to be stolen.

698
00:58:16,283 --> 00:58:19,775
There may be industrial spy in our company

699
00:58:21,572 --> 00:58:27,080
Our department is checking to see if the spy is there

700
00:58:28,377 --> 00:58:29,916
We got the proof at the end

701
00:58:30,095 --> 00:58:30,712
Proof?

702
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:33,103
Was there a spy here?

703
00:58:34,025 --> 00:58:37,361
I think you only have serious employees

704
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,720
The spy is in this room

705
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:44,799
Because there was a flaw in our defense measures.

706
00:58:46,908 --> 00:58:51,767
This is my fault, I'm sorry

707
00:58:52,931 --> 00:58:55,150
Now I announce who the spy is

708
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:01,127
Hashizume-kun

709
00:59:02,095 --> 00:59:02,627
What?

710
00:59:03,361 --> 00:59:07,119
You announce here as a 3S Electric Spy

711
00:59:07,275 --> 00:59:08,572
Am I spy?

712
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:10,885
What the hell?

713
00:59:11,158 --> 00:59:12,174
Don't pretend you don't know

714
00:59:14,142 --> 00:59:17,705
There are many suspicious points lately, so I asked Kaneko to investigate them.

715
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,142
I found out about your relationship with Mr. Machida of 3S.

716
00:59:22,963 --> 00:59:24,267
Needless to explain

717
00:59:25,072 --> 00:59:26,205
This is the proof

718
00:59:27,049 --> 00:59:29,135
Here's a picture of when you met him secretly

719
00:59:36,267 --> 00:59:36,860
Ms.isomura

720
00:59:37,806 --> 00:59:39,377
He is Nakaoka from Chugai electric

721
00:59:39,861 --> 00:59:43,111
He will be in charge of the show on behalf of Mr. Hashizume

722
00:59:43,572 --> 00:59:44,588
I'm Nakaoka

723
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,885
I'm Isomura

724
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:49,260
I didn't know you were in charge

725
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,431
Mr. Hashizume was fired from the company today

726
00:59:52,595 --> 00:59:53,197
Why?

727
00:59:54,478 --> 00:59:57,236
This is just between you and me,

728
00:59:57,822 --> 00:59:58,408
Spy?

729
00:59:58,666 --> 01:00:00,275
He was a industrial spy

730
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:01,744
I was also surprised

731
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:03,385
Which company's

732
01:00:03,736 --> 01:00:04,705
I hear it's 3s electric's

733
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:13,736
How many cigarettes do you smoke a day?

734
01:00:15,572 --> 01:00:17,502
I'm asking you

735
01:00:18,838 --> 01:00:20,064
That's depend on day

736
01:00:21,205 --> 01:00:23,799
I don't care about the number of cigarettes when I'm thinking

737
01:00:24,103 --> 01:00:26,416
You smoke too much

738
01:00:27,072 --> 01:00:28,908
I haven't charged you for cigarettes

739
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:30,619
I have no money to lend to you

740
01:00:37,978 --> 01:00:39,455
Is Hinuma here?

741
01:00:39,783 --> 01:00:40,963
What's wrong with him?

742
01:00:41,236 --> 01:00:42,220
Where is he now?

743
01:00:42,525 --> 01:00:43,408
He is in Kumagaya

744
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,533
He went looking for a 3S factory

745
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:46,822
When has he left?

746
01:00:46,978 --> 01:00:47,580
This morning

747
01:00:47,689 --> 01:00:48,658
There is a problem

748
01:00:49,017 --> 01:00:50,205
What's wrong with him?

749
01:00:50,845 --> 01:00:54,252
I told Mr. Hashizume about him

750
01:00:55,314 --> 01:00:57,314
Because I thought he is an employee of Chugai Electric

751
01:00:58,533 --> 01:01:00,861
I didn't know He is 3s's spy

752
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:02,908
What? Hashizume is a spy?

753
01:01:03,759 --> 01:01:04,689
I heard it today

754
01:01:06,259 --> 01:01:10,759
If he is a spy, all of Hinuma's actions are known to be 3S.

755
01:01:11,814 --> 01:01:15,166
It's very dangerous for him to go to the 3S Factory

756
01:01:32,931 --> 01:01:34,556
We are from the Kumagaya Fire Department

757
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:37,892
We came for a temporary inspection

758
01:01:43,322 --> 01:01:44,041
Is this real?

759
01:01:44,189 --> 01:01:44,861
Yes

760
01:01:47,689 --> 01:01:48,603
Thanks for your work

761
01:01:51,033 --> 01:01:53,595
Please put this on your chest

762
01:01:54,791 --> 01:01:55,556
Thanks

763
01:02:01,064 --> 01:02:02,056
Hello?

764
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:06,041
I'll show you around

765
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:09,361
Don’t worry about us

766
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:26,220
We finally found it

767
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:27,924
It's a very small TV

768
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:29,994
That is 4 in TV for sure

769
01:04:32,463 --> 01:04:34,127
This has just been replaced

770
01:04:35,486 --> 01:04:36,963
Thanks for telling me

771
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:03,720
Who is the duo in the coat?

772
01:05:03,931 --> 01:05:05,033
They are from the fire department

773
01:05:05,392 --> 01:05:06,345
They're here for a temporary inspection.

774
01:05:06,478 --> 01:05:07,345
Did you confirm their identity?

775
01:05:07,431 --> 01:05:08,697
They had an ID card

776
01:05:12,244 --> 01:05:13,580
Please contact the fire department

777
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:14,196
Yes

778
01:05:14,384 --> 01:05:15,345
But...

779
01:05:15,947 --> 01:05:17,838
An emergency security order has been issued from the head office

780
01:05:18,322 --> 01:05:18,767
Yes

781
01:05:44,978 --> 01:05:47,502
What siren is this?

782
01:05:50,134 --> 01:05:51,509
The news that a spy has infiltrated

783
01:06:00,313 --> 01:06:01,134
Then see you

784
01:06:01,228 --> 01:06:01,892
Thank you

785
01:06:07,486 --> 01:06:09,634
Hey! Catch them

786
01:06:13,392 --> 01:06:14,611
Run away!

787
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,377
Wait!

788
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:35,689
Wait!

789
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:41,814
Let's escape to the back

790
01:06:41,955 --> 01:06:43,088
Wait!

791
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,322
Take this and run away

792
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:48,924
Run straight here

793
01:06:49,439 --> 01:06:50,861
There is a gate

794
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:56,072
Come on!

795
01:06:57,728 --> 01:06:58,627
Come on!

796
01:07:03,181 --> 01:07:04,549
Come on!

797
01:07:06,955 --> 01:07:07,861
Wait!

798
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:12,869
Wait!

799
01:07:14,634 --> 01:07:15,650
Wait!

800
01:07:19,283 --> 01:07:20,666
Close the gate

801
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:26,228
Run away!

802
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:31,361
Run away!

803
01:07:46,431 --> 01:07:47,369
Who are you?

804
01:07:52,736 --> 01:07:54,752
Hey, say something

805
01:08:01,259 --> 01:08:03,431
I'm looking up

806
01:08:12,431 --> 01:08:13,892
He seems to have escaped well

807
01:08:14,502 --> 01:08:15,064
Shout up

808
01:08:15,439 --> 01:08:16,658
Who are you spying for?

809
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,533
I will talk after meeting the factory manager

810
01:08:20,572 --> 01:08:22,455
We will dispose of you

811
01:08:22,861 --> 01:08:25,299
If you do,You may be fired

812
01:08:25,939 --> 01:08:29,205
In addition you will be arrested by the police

813
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:44,666
Are you the factory manager?

814
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:45,588
Who are you?

815
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,213
I'm Takashi Hinuma

816
01:08:47,963 --> 01:08:49,759
I'm from Isomura Industrial Research Institute

817
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,150
That's what I thought

818
01:08:52,033 --> 01:08:53,291
I know you are here

819
01:08:54,736 --> 01:08:55,509
I was waiting for you

820
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:57,877
Really?

821
01:09:00,252 --> 01:09:01,728
Then it's easy to talk about.

822
01:09:02,955 --> 01:09:05,713
Well, that's the problem with my people running away.

823
01:09:06,252 --> 01:09:07,916
It's enough to catch you alone

824
01:09:09,197 --> 01:09:10,541
Crimes of trespassing

825
01:09:11,736 --> 01:09:13,845
Injury charges and obstruction of business

826
01:09:14,330 --> 01:09:16,392
Your sins are many.

827
01:09:17,524 --> 01:09:19,665
But it's not easy

828
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:23,236
We hold the secret of this factory

829
01:09:23,955 --> 01:09:28,525
He can tell that information to Chugai Electric

830
01:09:28,806 --> 01:09:30,228
We can sell it at high price

831
01:09:31,299 --> 01:09:33,634
But I am the only person who can stop him

832
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:34,681
Let's deal?

833
01:09:36,431 --> 01:09:37,345
What are you doing?

834
01:09:37,517 --> 01:09:39,549
I'll talk to Mr. Machida directly.

835
01:09:39,931 --> 01:09:42,236
You also need his instructions

836
01:09:43,283 --> 01:09:44,681
Please connect to the Tokyo head office

837
01:09:52,267 --> 01:09:54,111
Hi, I'm Machida

838
01:09:55,236 --> 01:09:56,345
What? Hinuma?

839
01:09:56,486 --> 01:09:58,033
Hi,machida-san?

840
01:09:58,541 --> 01:09:59,447
It's been a whole

841
01:10:00,189 --> 01:10:04,220
Now I am in your factory manager's office and looked around the site

842
01:10:05,486 --> 01:10:06,353
And

843
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:09,384
What?

844
01:10:11,572 --> 01:10:12,877
Did you take the photo?

845
01:10:13,306 --> 01:10:16,908
Do you buy the film?
I'll make the price

846
01:10:18,142 --> 01:10:20,869
Includes President Isomura's incense fee

847
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:24,986
If you don't buy, there are many people who want to buy

848
01:10:31,127 --> 01:10:33,634
Come to the headquarters tomorrow.

849
01:10:34,369 --> 01:10:35,025
at 7 pm

850
01:10:35,869 --> 01:10:37,556
We can talk there

851
01:10:41,291 --> 01:10:44,291
Good.
I'm looking forward to seeing you

852
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:48,072
I'm in captivity now

853
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:50,228
Change the phone to the factory manager

854
01:10:51,306 --> 01:10:51,963
Talk to him

855
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:05,681
I've failed.

856
01:11:07,142 --> 01:11:09,595
The security system of the factory has been tightened.

857
01:11:11,361 --> 01:11:13,713
How much does he demand?

858
01:11:14,205 --> 01:11:15,369
I'll meet him tomorrow

859
01:11:17,353 --> 01:11:20,205
But before that, we have to decide the policy of the company

860
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:25,439
How complete is the AH 4-inch TV?

861
01:11:25,884 --> 01:11:27,369
Up to now, 100 units have been made

862
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:34,900
It will be released 4 months in advance, so we will increase production capacity by then.

863
01:11:35,361 --> 01:11:37,799
Eventually 2000 units will be in stock

864
01:11:39,799 --> 01:11:43,884
If you can't release it, we have to make it public.

865
01:11:44,689 --> 01:11:47,291
If we do that, other companies will imitate it.

866
01:11:48,619 --> 01:11:52,955
Other companies may know the structure of ultra-small TVs and enter the production system

867
01:11:54,306 --> 01:11:57,830
Then the market will be confused

868
01:11:59,306 --> 01:12:03,588
If they do so, we will not be able to sell the AH 4-inch TV exclusively.

869
01:12:04,345 --> 01:12:05,642
All our efforts will be in vain.

870
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:10,822
Either buy it at his asking price or make it public.

871
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:12,291
There are two choices

872
01:12:12,783 --> 01:12:20,978
If we buy from him, it doesn't mean our secrets won't leak to other companies.

873
01:12:24,377 --> 01:12:26,330
Hello?
Oh Hinuma

874
01:12:27,502 --> 01:12:28,509
Did you succeed?

875
01:12:29,377 --> 01:12:31,908
That's good.
I worried about you

876
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:35,509
Akiko-san is here

877
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:36,853
She also worried about you

878
01:12:38,049 --> 01:12:40,228
Let me get her on the phone.

879
01:12:44,033 --> 01:12:44,759
Hello?

880
01:12:46,603 --> 01:12:47,533
Akiko-san?

881
01:12:51,689 --> 01:12:53,377
Mr. Hashizume was a spy for 3S?

882
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:56,572
I see

883
01:12:59,634 --> 01:13:02,642
No worry.
I've got their secret.

884
01:13:03,516 --> 01:13:07,430
Maybe we'll find out who killed your father.

885
01:13:09,767 --> 01:13:11,314
I definitely want this

886
01:13:11,939 --> 01:13:13,556
Don't push yourself too hard

887
01:13:15,212 --> 01:13:15,892
Yes

888
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:18,548
He wants to talk with you

889
01:13:21,837 --> 01:13:22,759
Hashizume?

890
01:13:25,868 --> 01:13:27,025
We'll find out his address

891
01:13:28,618 --> 01:13:29,861
OK,
Leave it to me

892
01:13:30,173 --> 01:13:30,650
Good

893
01:13:33,790 --> 01:13:37,587
You were valuable because you were at Chugai Electric.

894
01:13:38,407 --> 01:13:41,236
You were fired as a spy.
You are no use anymore

895
01:13:41,579 --> 01:13:42,306
Machida-san

896
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:45,517
I've been working hard for 3 S so far

897
01:13:46,704 --> 01:13:48,931
I was an employee of Chugai Electric, and I worked for the 3Ss.

898
01:13:50,118 --> 01:13:53,197
Do you understand my miserable feelings?

899
01:13:53,532 --> 01:13:57,040
You were originally an employee of Chugai Electric.

900
01:13:58,001 --> 01:14:00,212
As for your espionage, I settled for money.

901
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:03,915
The company hires people who can help the company develop

902
01:14:04,236 --> 01:14:08,681
No need for worthless spies anymore.
The relationship with you will be cut off in the future

903
01:14:09,337 --> 01:14:10,767
This is a natural decision

904
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:15,556
You'll be working for another company.

905
01:14:15,767 --> 01:14:16,876
Damn it

906
01:14:16,931 --> 01:14:22,150
Treat me like trash and I will surely make you regret it.

907
01:14:22,322 --> 01:14:25,251
I will reveal all the secrets of this company

908
01:14:25,884 --> 01:14:27,572
Can you send him out?

909
01:14:30,493 --> 01:14:31,970
Give him some money

910
01:14:54,915 --> 01:14:55,884
Are you Hashizume-san,right?

911
01:14:56,361 --> 01:14:57,259
Who are you?

912
01:14:58,478 --> 01:15:00,040
I'm from this company

913
01:15:05,064 --> 01:15:08,228
I have a favor to ask of you.

914
01:15:09,845 --> 01:15:10,970
It's not big deal

915
01:15:12,165 --> 01:15:16,853
I want you to call Mr. Uehara of Taiyo Research

916
01:15:17,431 --> 01:15:18,103
To Mr. Uehara?

917
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,634
Yes To Mr. Uehara

918
01:15:22,243 --> 01:15:23,790
It's a simple requirement

919
01:15:24,986 --> 01:15:27,064
I want you to call him up.

920
01:15:30,032 --> 01:15:35,361
If you refuse, you will be guilty of murder.

921
01:15:37,032 --> 01:15:38,743
I quit spying

922
01:15:41,892 --> 01:15:44,204
I hate being arrested

923
01:15:54,173 --> 01:15:57,368
I promise to meet him at 1 o'clock

924
01:15:58,064 --> 01:15:59,493
Yes..but

925
01:16:00,486 --> 01:16:03,392
He's in trouble if he doesn't meet me

926
01:16:12,236 --> 01:16:13,954
What's happening?

927
01:16:15,181 --> 01:16:17,665
There will be a press conference from now on

928
01:16:18,025 --> 01:16:18,852
There will be a press conference?

929
01:16:33,595 --> 01:16:34,947
Look at this,everyone

930
01:16:35,704 --> 01:16:40,595
This is 3S Electric's new 4 in TV

931
01:16:46,720 --> 01:16:48,431
This is a great product

932
01:16:48,587 --> 01:16:50,759
How much is the price?

933
01:16:50,790 --> 01:16:52,861
Is this a self-confident work?

934
01:16:53,486 --> 01:16:54,650
Oh It's not expensive

935
01:16:54,675 --> 01:16:56,017
So you can buy

936
01:16:58,447 --> 01:16:59,876
What are you doing?

937
01:17:00,126 --> 01:17:02,095
There was a traffic jam

938
01:17:07,345 --> 01:17:09,439
This design is pretty good

939
01:17:50,345 --> 01:17:51,275
Sit down

940
01:18:10,478 --> 01:18:14,353
I respect your efforts

941
01:18:16,806 --> 01:18:17,595
But

942
01:18:19,212 --> 01:18:22,712
The secret you grabbed is no longer worth it

943
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:27,986
Please take a look at our products slowly

944
01:18:33,189 --> 01:18:36,142
I just want to tell you this

945
01:18:38,697 --> 01:18:40,236
Our original plan is

946
01:18:41,853 --> 01:18:46,892
The plan was to secure inventory quantities and monopolize the market.

947
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:51,579
But we had a press conference today

948
01:18:52,907 --> 01:18:57,197
I think other companies will develop the same product

949
01:18:58,181 --> 01:18:59,697
So our market is monopolized for only 6 months

950
01:19:00,634 --> 01:19:03,697
But in the meantime we will sell as much as possible

951
01:19:05,939 --> 01:19:12,743
For at least 10 months, we will dominate the market for 4-inch small TVs.

952
01:19:16,329 --> 01:19:19,540
I just want to tell you this

953
01:19:19,814 --> 01:19:22,064
Please congratulate us

954
01:19:30,243 --> 01:19:31,212
congratulation

955
01:19:32,603 --> 01:19:34,220
I just want to tell you this

956
01:19:36,493 --> 01:19:37,306
See you

957
01:20:12,548 --> 01:20:13,165
Come in

958
01:20:18,782 --> 01:20:20,064
What's wrong?

959
01:20:20,376 --> 01:20:24,400
I got a call from Mr. Hashizume.
You want us to come here

960
01:20:25,064 --> 01:20:26,056
Did I call you?

961
01:20:27,876 --> 01:20:29,892
I didn't.
Something is wrong

962
01:20:30,353 --> 01:20:31,087
machida-san

963
01:20:31,923 --> 01:20:35,486
Are you going to fire us like Hashizume?

964
01:20:39,899 --> 01:20:42,469
I rewarded you for sure

965
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:46,407
We announced 4 in TV

966
01:20:47,697 --> 01:20:50,587
Our business is over.
What do you want?

967
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:53,251
We also have an idea if you dismiss us

968
01:20:54,361 --> 01:20:57,001
We announce that We have killed Isomura at your order

969
01:20:57,689 --> 01:20:58,509
Isomura?

970
01:20:59,361 --> 01:21:00,673
Do whatever you want

971
01:21:01,923 --> 01:21:04,525
There is no evidence that I did

972
01:21:06,423 --> 01:21:09,673
I don't know if he was killed or not

973
01:21:11,806 --> 01:21:13,743
If the police are involved, you're in more trouble, right?

974
01:21:14,142 --> 01:21:17,048
We are not afraid of it

975
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:25,516
Isomura found out 3S Electric's development of a small TV.
He pushed Isomura in front of the truck

976
01:21:26,978 --> 01:21:28,509
And I ordered him that

977
01:21:29,337 --> 01:21:34,236
But if we are arrested you will be called by the police as a witness

978
01:21:35,478 --> 01:21:37,556
I will announce everything

979
01:21:39,111 --> 01:21:41,345
You are in trouble, right?

980
01:21:41,868 --> 01:21:44,720
We don't care if we get arrested

981
01:21:45,290 --> 01:21:47,939
But you are also responsible

982
01:21:48,751 --> 01:21:50,220
We'll get you involved.

983
01:21:53,072 --> 01:21:54,017
I get it

984
01:21:56,993 --> 01:21:59,095
Will you become an temporary employee of our company at 400,000 a month?

985
01:22:00,493 --> 01:22:03,173
Please say so from the beginning

986
01:22:19,322 --> 01:22:20,056
Machida-san

987
01:22:21,142 --> 01:22:23,118
I have one more thing I want you to buy

988
01:22:23,642 --> 01:22:24,290
What?

989
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:37,353
It's thanks to your company's wireless microphones that we know who killed President Isomura.

990
01:22:40,439 --> 01:22:41,626
Don't say bullshit

991
01:22:44,822 --> 01:22:46,243
Where did you hide the microphone?

992
01:22:48,384 --> 01:22:52,462
I recorded all your conversations

993
01:22:55,493 --> 01:23:03,165
Isomura found out 3S Electric's development of a small TV.
He pushed Isomura in front of the truck

994
01:23:04,142 --> 01:23:05,884
And I ordered him that

995
01:23:06,517 --> 01:23:11,219
But if we are arrested you will be called by the police as a witness

996
01:23:12,540 --> 01:23:14,407
I will announce everything

997
01:23:15,899 --> 01:23:17,759
You are in trouble, right?

998
01:23:25,579 --> 01:23:27,900
Industrial espionage is not just your specialty

999
01:23:29,477 --> 01:23:32,173
It wouldn't be strange if there was one spy in this company.

1000
01:23:37,251 --> 01:23:38,157
How much you want?

1001
01:23:41,079 --> 01:23:42,688
Hey! How much you want?

1002
01:23:44,415 --> 01:23:47,329
I don't want to sell this

1003
01:23:49,485 --> 01:23:54,485
Don't try to solve everything with money!

1004
01:23:56,438 --> 01:23:58,743
This dead leaf is the dead leaf that was in your factory

1005
01:23:59,673 --> 01:24:01,454
President Isomura had the same dead leaves

1006
01:24:01,813 --> 01:24:03,165
It is kept at the police station in Kumagaya

1007
01:24:04,806 --> 01:24:09,579
President Isomura was imprisoned in your factory and killed

1008
01:24:11,063 --> 01:24:14,837
Police investigate the background

1009
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:26,384
Moreover

1010
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:29,345
Hashizume you fired

1011
01:24:30,126 --> 01:24:32,610
He appears in the police as an important person

1012
01:25:23,259 --> 01:25:28,134
Mr. Machida of 3S Electric is said to have been dismissed.

1013
01:25:28,626 --> 01:25:29,227
He was fired

1014
01:25:30,681 --> 01:25:34,274
I think President Isomura will be a little pleased with this.

1015
01:25:34,868 --> 01:25:36,602
But it's a little complicated.

1016
01:25:37,071 --> 01:25:37,962
Here is your tea

1017
01:25:42,821 --> 01:25:46,977
Machida also worked hard for the company and was finally dismissed

1018
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:49,704
I feel sorry for him

1019
01:25:50,860 --> 01:25:55,337
By the way, what will happen to us in the future?

1020
01:25:57,149 --> 01:26:01,829
We have to work for living

1021
01:26:03,227 --> 01:26:06,110
Let's talk about work when Hinuma returns

1022
01:26:10,102 --> 01:26:10,899
Hinuma-san

1023
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:13,954
I'm sure my dad is grateful to you

1024
01:26:15,384 --> 01:26:16,767
I don't think I've been helpful.

1025
01:26:18,774 --> 01:26:22,110
I felt like I was facing a big company

1026
01:26:23,493 --> 01:26:24,860
What will you do from now on?

1027
01:26:25,493 --> 01:26:26,860
I'm thinking of going to Kansai

1028
01:26:27,438 --> 01:26:28,204
To Kansai?

1029
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:32,313
Now is the age of wireless

1030
01:26:32,509 --> 01:26:34,313
Car phone is one of them

1031
01:26:35,306 --> 01:26:39,165
I heard a rumor that a company in Kansai will develop it

1032
01:26:39,915 --> 01:26:40,517
So

1033
01:26:41,368 --> 01:26:43,157
You don't change anything

1034
01:26:43,704 --> 01:26:45,618
Would you like to investigate a wireless company this time?

1035
01:26:46,431 --> 01:26:48,368
No, it isn't.

1036
01:26:48,993 --> 01:26:51,501
Not a spy activity from another company

1037
01:26:52,548 --> 01:26:57,220
It ’s a survey that surveys consumers and helps the company.

1038
01:26:57,767 --> 01:27:00,798
I would like to do such an economic survey

1039
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:03,915
I'm sure my colleagues will cooperate

1040
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:08,165
That's cool.
Would you like to change the name of the company and start again?

1041
01:27:09,009 --> 01:27:11,985
Isomura Industrial Research Institute is uncool name

1042
01:27:12,188 --> 01:27:15,813
I will not change the name of the company for the president

1043
01:27:16,423 --> 01:27:18,235
You are a very old-fashioned person

1044
01:27:19,001 --> 01:27:23,321
We need an old-fashioned man in this era

1045
01:27:24,290 --> 01:27:26,165
I may also be an old-fashioned woman

1046
01:27:27,267 --> 01:27:29,931
I think I'll go to Kansai with you.

1047
01:27:32,610 --> 01:27:33,204
Akiko-san

1048
01:27:38,352 --> 01:27:39,407
I'll pick you up

1049
01:27:39,806 --> 01:27:40,477
Surely

1050
01:27:41,985 --> 01:27:46,673
Until then, you should be doing TV commercials for Isomura Industrial Research Institute on TV.

1051
01:27:47,235 --> 01:27:48,837
Special price, please.

1052
01:28:02,759 --> 01:28:12,000
The end

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,195
Betrayer

3
00:01:08,432 --> 00:01:11,018
No... I don't like it

4
00:01:11,948 --> 00:01:13,933
I don't want to leave from you

5
00:01:14,972 --> 00:01:19,066
For the past two years, I've been tired.

6
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,230
If you stay with me, your life will be ruined.

7
00:01:23,878 --> 00:01:28,636
They say once a woman is ruined, she can't be
resurrected.

8
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,511
If you don't like me anymore, please speak up.

9
00:01:39,323 --> 00:01:44,300
I'm glad if you come to see me sometime

10
00:01:45,253 --> 00:01:50,433
When I heard that you'd introduced me to the
Shinwa Corporation, I knew I could bounce back.

11
00:01:51,948 --> 00:01:57,409
I figured if I could get a fixed salary of 50,000 yen
plus a 30% commission on sales, I could pay off my debt.

12
00:01:58,136 --> 00:02:01,878
I knew I could make a comeback if I took the right
chances.

13
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:10,206
But No sales at all for two months.

14
00:02:11,253 --> 00:02:17,128
I found out.
Our expensive massager won't sell now.

15
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:20,136
Mr.Sawai said clearly

16
00:02:20,917 --> 00:02:26,909
He said he'd hire you as a partner in a partnership, not a
salesman.

17
00:02:28,354 --> 00:02:32,362
The name doesn't matter.
I can't live on 50,000 yen.

18
00:02:33,378 --> 00:02:35,191
Of course, I can't pay my debts.

19
00:02:37,214 --> 00:02:40,347
But a fixed salary of 50,000 yen sounds good to
you

20
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:46,542
If I don't, I'll never recover my life

21
00:02:49,495 --> 00:02:50,597
Damn it

22
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,792
I need money

23
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:57,222
Please stop saying it.
Money does not matter

24
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:14,448
For the last two months I've been trying, but I haven't sold a single
unit.

25
00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:16,433
I don't think I can sell from now

26
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,753
Can I sell different products?

27
00:03:23,034 --> 00:03:26,737
Regardless of whether you sell or not, your salary is
guaranteed.

28
00:03:28,527 --> 00:03:30,558
I know but 50000 yen is too less

29
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,487
You want more?

30
00:03:37,487 --> 00:03:44,776
To be honest,I made a lot of money when I worked at a brokerage
firm.

31
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:53,144
But the stock market crashed and I lost 7 million
yen.

32
00:03:55,245 --> 00:03:58,073
I made up for it a little by selling off some of our unwanted
items.

33
00:03:59,386 --> 00:04:04,753
I'll be sued if I don't repay the 5 million yen.

34
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,894
So I need money anyway

35
00:04:09,855 --> 00:04:11,206
You're in dire straits.

36
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,128
I'll do anything for money besides erotic things

37
00:04:19,464 --> 00:04:20,573
I feel secure knowing you are with me.

38
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:30,800
What are you doing?

39
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,698
Go home

40
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:34,691
Yes

41
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:50,191
You are the one whom I expected

42
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:55,550
You told me you'll do anything for money

43
00:04:56,605 --> 00:04:57,089
Yes

44
00:04:57,933 --> 00:05:02,581
To be honest,It has nothing to do with selling electric
massagers.

45
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,417
In short, I've wanted the word from you

46
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,480
Please drink

47
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:18,276
Have you ever heard of industrial espionage?

48
00:05:19,409 --> 00:05:19,956
Yes

49
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:26,956
I'm the head of an industrial espionage agency.

50
00:05:28,066 --> 00:05:31,855
It's to disguise the existence of a Shinwa
company and the sale of electric massages.

51
00:05:33,198 --> 00:05:36,503
All the other employees are industrial spies?

52
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,722
No.
You're the only candidate for industrial espionage.

53
00:05:43,948 --> 00:05:47,605
I plan to increase that number later

54
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,722
I'm carefully selecting people now

55
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:56,050
When I started this job, I wanted a competent
employee at a brokerage firm to start with.

56
00:05:56,894 --> 00:06:02,847
He has knowledge of stocks and is accustomed to interacting with people

57
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:05,261
He's used to business news

58
00:06:05,355 --> 00:06:09,183
In other words, it is the best human resource for a spy.

59
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:15,105
I happened to hear from Kazumi-san, so I talked to you.

60
00:06:16,769 --> 00:06:21,284
If you succeed in one case, you can get 200000,300,000yen

61
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:23,987
In some cases you can get 1 million yen

62
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,740
You decide if you want to do it or not.

63
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,998
But if you're going to do it, you'll have to quit your current job today.

64
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:36,021
Don't tell this story to anyone.
Promise me

65
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,381
You can decide

66
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:05,459
I do

67
00:07:06,967 --> 00:07:07,685
Really?

68
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:13,568
My life is at rock bottom.

69
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,982
I can take the risk to get back my life

70
00:07:20,154 --> 00:07:22,904
Let's get the job done right away

71
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:31,498
Take advantage of your friendship to do this job

72
00:07:32,131 --> 00:07:33,834
My friendships?

73
00:07:34,576 --> 00:07:35,935
Nanayou chemistry

74
00:07:38,607 --> 00:07:44,256
Shoichi Ogino, managing director of that company, is a classmate at your university.

75
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:47,076
You and he are very close

76
00:07:48,888 --> 00:07:52,060
I researched a lot about you

77
00:07:53,857 --> 00:07:57,146
There is an engineer named Nishiwaki in the
laboratory of that company. Do you know him?

78
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:58,646
I don't know

79
00:07:59,732 --> 00:08:05,685
The husband of his sister,Sadako is this man

80
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,388
You know her,right?

81
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:15,381
Yes I have met her

82
00:08:15,904 --> 00:08:19,545
The Nishiwaki recently made a wonderful invention.

83
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:24,818
I found out he invented a great appliance

84
00:08:25,584 --> 00:08:27,787
I want to know how the product was made

85
00:08:31,326 --> 00:08:35,592
Actually I don't want to meet Ogino

86
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:37,420
Because of His wife,Eiko?

87
00:08:41,138 --> 00:08:43,490
I told you I researched a lot about you

88
00:08:44,912 --> 00:08:49,193
Since you were a student, you were planning to have a romantic relationship with Eiko and get married.

89
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:52,888
But two years ago, Eiko married Ogino.

90
00:08:54,178 --> 00:09:00,060
I don't know the season, but You lost Eiko to Ogino.

91
00:09:00,771 --> 00:09:02,060
The reason is money

92
00:09:03,748 --> 00:09:05,342
Because I couldn't repay my debt

93
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:07,607
I didn't know that

94
00:09:08,662 --> 00:09:12,771
Mr. Ogino took her from you because of your debt

95
00:09:14,974 --> 00:09:16,467
How much was your debt?

96
00:09:17,678 --> 00:09:18,912
It was 200000 yen

97
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:28,787
This is a prepayment of success fees

98
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:32,537
Please return as much as your work is completed

99
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,888
Mr. Ogino feels sorry for you.

100
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:39,615
I think this is a chance

101
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:46,498
I'm trying to betray my friendship with Mr. Ogino

102
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:50,271
But this may be the reward taken by Eiko

103
00:09:51,373 --> 00:09:53,685
Now I have no choice but to do this

104
00:09:55,326 --> 00:10:02,162
Maybe I was destined to be a spy

105
00:10:10,584 --> 00:10:16,209
Ogino called me and declared a marriage to you

106
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:19,490
He seemed to be victorious

107
00:10:21,951 --> 00:10:25,982
It might have been good that I couldn't repay my debt

108
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:30,490
I felt humiliated.

109
00:10:32,263 --> 00:10:34,623
I couldn't stand Ogino getting married to her

110
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:42,037
You don't care if I marry to Ogino?

111
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,662
I want to know your opinion

112
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,803
Please

113
00:10:52,857 --> 00:10:54,638
I can't do anything now

114
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,928
I can't make you happy because I don't have money

115
00:11:00,584 --> 00:11:05,170
To be clear, I can't afford to pay for today's meals

116
00:11:06,193 --> 00:11:09,365
But I think this is my last date with you

117
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,123
Stop it

118
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:15,951
Have you seriously considered the well-being of women?

119
00:11:19,803 --> 00:11:26,459
I wanted you to oppose my marriage to Mr. Ogino

120
00:11:45,373 --> 00:11:50,037
Two years have passed since then,
I do this job to live

121
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:55,724
What does Eiko think of me?

122
00:11:57,412 --> 00:11:59,654
I have a hard time meeting Eiko

123
00:12:10,013 --> 00:12:12,334
Oh, Segawa-san

124
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:13,928
Long time, no see

125
00:12:14,193 --> 00:12:16,443
Toshiko-san,
I met you in a strange place

126
00:12:16,592 --> 00:12:20,537
Because this is my sister's house

127
00:12:20,638 --> 00:12:21,553
That's right

128
00:12:22,263 --> 00:12:23,318
Please come in

129
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:25,740
How's your health?

130
00:12:25,765 --> 00:12:27,803
I'm fine now

131
00:12:27,828 --> 00:12:29,537
Are you married?

132
00:12:29,562 --> 00:12:33,334
I'm still single.
Please introduce someone good

133
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,099
Long time, no see

134
00:12:47,412 --> 00:12:50,935
She is my sister's classmate Kyoko Honda

135
00:12:51,154 --> 00:12:51,834
I'm Segawa

136
00:12:51,951 --> 00:12:53,631
Nice to meet you,I'm Kyoko

137
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,420
Do you know Kazumi Yamaguchi,right?

138
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:56,310
Yes

139
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:59,271
They are all classmates

140
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,303
All three were close friends

141
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,482
I see

142
00:13:03,928 --> 00:13:06,287
Segawa-san is..well how can I say....

143
00:13:07,326 --> 00:13:10,170
He is my sister's old friend

144
00:13:10,615 --> 00:13:11,467
Sister

145
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,685
Is there any problem?

146
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:17,881
Excuse me

147
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:21,154
Please come to the alumni association

148
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:24,271
I'm going home

149
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:25,068
Thanks

150
00:13:28,701 --> 00:13:29,326
See you

151
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:30,545
See you

152
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,412
What happened to you

153
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,443
Come in

154
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:49,381
How have you been doing?

155
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:52,029
Yes

156
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:01,826
You haven't sat down yet

157
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:04,857
Here is your tea

158
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:11,037
Oh he came back

159
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,662
He should've come home later.

160
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:24,381
You are cowardly

161
00:14:25,185 --> 00:14:25,919
cowardly?

162
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:31,162
Yes,
You played with my sister's heart

163
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,818
Do you think my sister is happy now?

164
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:37,474
At least she didn't have to marry me

165
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:38,443
No

166
00:14:38,982 --> 00:14:42,185
Anyway, take your time to talk to her once.

167
00:14:44,357 --> 00:14:47,263
Oh, sorry to keep you wait

168
00:14:47,545 --> 00:14:49,107
I've just come here

169
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,092
You knew he was coming

170
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:53,326
He called me

171
00:14:53,748 --> 00:14:55,482
Oh I see

172
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:57,615
I want to drink whiskey

173
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,045
OK

174
00:14:59,045 --> 00:15:00,295
What have you been doing lately?

175
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,732
I'm sorry I didn't contact you

176
00:15:02,896 --> 00:15:04,513
I had a lot of problems

177
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:06,685
I was worried about you

178
00:15:06,802 --> 00:15:09,607
I was a wanderer, and I was feeling down.

179
00:15:09,632 --> 00:15:10,154
wanderer?

180
00:15:10,476 --> 00:15:13,984
I recently started a small company with a friend

181
00:15:14,851 --> 00:15:15,726
That's good

182
00:15:17,773 --> 00:15:21,898
This is part of the money I borrowed from you

183
00:15:23,077 --> 00:15:27,320
I can't give you all your money back.
Is it okay to pay in installments?

184
00:15:28,148 --> 00:15:34,273
No way.
You don't have to worry about that at all

185
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,874
Thank you for waiting

186
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,382
Thank you for this money

187
00:15:41,015 --> 00:15:43,663
Don't worry about the rest of the money

188
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:44,843
Thank you

189
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,374
Where is Eiko,Toshiko-san?

190
00:15:47,062 --> 00:15:49,054
She said she is dizzy

191
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:50,476
I see

192
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:53,054
She is sick

193
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,820
Yes

194
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,429
Please enjoy

195
00:16:00,811 --> 00:16:02,826
By the way, thanks this

196
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:04,960
You are welcome

197
00:16:06,288 --> 00:16:07,421
What do you want to talk about?

198
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,523
Actually I need your help

199
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,030
I see.
What kind?

200
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,195
I want to sell your company's products.

201
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:19,952
I would be happy to sign a distributorship with you.

202
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:24,726
However, many of our products are special.

203
00:16:24,874 --> 00:16:26,905
First you have to study it

204
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:31,842
So I want to visit your company's factory for the study

205
00:16:31,867 --> 00:16:35,921
I will guide you at any time.
How about tomorrow?

206
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:39,062
That's good

207
00:16:41,187 --> 00:16:43,007
The start went better than I expected

208
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,343
Finally Betrayal to Mr. Ogino begins

209
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,257
Your company is making various new products, isn't it?

210
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:59,398
Yes.
There is a research institute in this, and professionals are doing research

211
00:17:00,304 --> 00:17:02,695
Person called Nishiwaki is the best of them

212
00:17:02,749 --> 00:17:05,452
Not at all

213
00:17:05,976 --> 00:17:08,304
What kind of research are you doing now?

214
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:11,468
It's like a supermarket?

215
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,632
I will go back to work

216
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:19,648
Please guide him later

217
00:17:20,343 --> 00:17:21,366
Thank you in advance

218
00:17:21,655 --> 00:17:22,312
My pleasure

219
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:26,405
He is the husband of my sister Sadako

220
00:17:26,632 --> 00:17:28,874
He is my brother-in-law

221
00:17:29,155 --> 00:17:30,007
Boss

222
00:17:30,374 --> 00:17:31,038
What?

223
00:17:31,475 --> 00:17:32,491
I have a phone call from the president

224
00:17:32,695 --> 00:17:33,249
I see

225
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:34,788
He is my secretary Fujita

226
00:17:35,968 --> 00:17:36,679
Excuse me

227
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:39,054
I'm Fujita.
Pleased to meet you

228
00:17:39,445 --> 00:17:40,984
I'm Segawa, Ogino's classmate

229
00:17:41,171 --> 00:17:44,398
I see.
Mr.Ogino takes care of me well

230
00:17:50,327 --> 00:17:52,148
This is from Nishiwaki

231
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:54,257
This is a brochure of the company's products so
far

232
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:55,366
Thank you

233
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,171
She's Mr. Nishiwaki's secretary at the institute.

234
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:01,280
She knows everything about our institute.

235
00:18:01,968 --> 00:18:03,429
Please take care of him before boss come back

236
00:18:04,187 --> 00:18:05,624
I have to leave now

237
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,655
He is very friendly

238
00:18:14,491 --> 00:18:17,171
There's a lot of activity in this lab.

239
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,812
According to Ogino you've recently developed a new
product.

240
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,139
Is that Paramizale?

241
00:18:27,937 --> 00:18:29,273
Yes Paramizale

242
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,468
I hear it's great product

243
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:35,960
But I don't know anything about that product.

244
00:18:38,194 --> 00:18:40,679
How is Ogino's reputation?

245
00:18:40,835 --> 00:18:41,280
What?

246
00:18:42,015 --> 00:18:46,101
He is manager, good looking and has wife

247
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:49,100
Is he popular among women workers?

248
00:18:52,054 --> 00:18:54,952
Are you one of his fan?

249
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,804
Ah.. Can I get this?

250
00:19:03,085 --> 00:19:05,007
I need to thank you

251
00:19:05,929 --> 00:19:09,140
Oh yeah, I can use this woman

252
00:19:10,139 --> 00:19:11,577
Shall we dance?

253
00:19:11,687 --> 00:19:12,812
I can't dance

254
00:19:13,327 --> 00:19:14,303
Let's dance?

255
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:15,241
I can't dance

256
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:15,827
Please go to dance

257
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:24,984
Who is she?

258
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:26,351
For my business

259
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,476
Mr.Sawai left me a big work

260
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,874
I might be able to pay off my debt if it goes
well

261
00:19:32,999 --> 00:19:35,085
What is your relationship with your work and
her?

262
00:19:36,116 --> 00:19:37,569
I'll tell you later

263
00:19:38,148 --> 00:19:41,296
I met Eiko at the class meeting yesterday.

264
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:43,593
She is beautiful as it is

265
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:45,874
Stop talking about her

266
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,874
Come to our place tonight?

267
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:09,687
Find out more about that new product,Paramizale.
Find out the connection between Nishiwaki, Kondo and Fujita.

268
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:14,999
You looked into this on your first visit.
It's amazing.

269
00:20:16,484 --> 00:20:21,554
Which of these four points of contact shall we examine first?
Find out the connection between Nishiwaki, Kondo and Fujita.

270
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,874
That's the point

271
00:20:26,507 --> 00:20:27,265
Come in

272
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,562
Segawa-san,
There is a call from Murazaki

273
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,468
Murazaki

274
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:32,702
Yes a woman

275
00:20:34,577 --> 00:20:35,249
Thanks

276
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,671
Ah, I'm Toshiko

277
00:20:41,179 --> 00:20:43,827
Can I meet you tonight?

278
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,648
I want to talk with you

279
00:20:49,343 --> 00:20:51,976
Yes, It's very important

280
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,796
What kind?

281
00:20:54,741 --> 00:20:56,148
I want to see you in person

282
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:59,359
Please come to Ginza

283
00:21:26,163 --> 00:21:27,944
I got a call from Toshiko

284
00:21:28,429 --> 00:21:29,398
Me too

285
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,484
She told me there is a important thing

286
00:21:36,499 --> 00:21:37,109
One coffee,please

287
00:21:37,234 --> 00:21:37,812
I get it

288
00:21:42,851 --> 00:21:46,476
Mr.Segawa, There is a call for you

289
00:21:48,428 --> 00:21:51,733
How's going?
Are you upset with me?

290
00:21:52,874 --> 00:21:55,468
Or you appreciate with me?

291
00:21:57,663 --> 00:21:58,491
Not at all

292
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:04,218
I was so concerned about my sister.

293
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,132
Enjoy

294
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:14,984
I didn't know my sister's made this

295
00:22:17,319 --> 00:22:19,734
You don't change anything

296
00:22:20,554 --> 00:22:21,890
No.. I've changed

297
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:26,773
I felt it when I visited you the other day

298
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:29,812
I've changed

299
00:22:37,734 --> 00:22:38,593
Madam

300
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:41,702
Oh Eiko-san

301
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:48,506
Sadako-san,
You know him? Ogino's classmate, Segawa

302
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:51,952
Oh I remember, I'm sorry I didn't realize you

303
00:22:53,132 --> 00:22:57,233
You have changed a lot.
I'm sorry I didn't realize you

304
00:22:57,624 --> 00:23:01,554
You visited us, but I couldn't show you around,
I was sorry

305
00:23:01,952 --> 00:23:03,155
He visited your company?

306
00:23:03,421 --> 00:23:05,382
He came with Mr.Ogino

307
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,382
Oh I see

308
00:23:08,866 --> 00:23:10,194
Can I take a seat?

309
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:11,640
Please

310
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,983
I was about to leave

311
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:18,249
You don't have to worry.
It's been a whole

312
00:23:18,796 --> 00:23:22,874
I went to shop and I happened to meet Segawa-san

313
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,577
By chance?

314
00:23:25,632 --> 00:23:26,327
Yes

315
00:23:28,452 --> 00:23:30,569
I asked her to have a coffee

316
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:33,991
Please take your time

317
00:23:34,304 --> 00:23:34,757
See you

318
00:23:36,312 --> 00:23:38,343
I need to go too

319
00:23:38,368 --> 00:23:39,718
Are you busy?

320
00:23:40,046 --> 00:23:40,624
Kind of

321
00:23:41,124 --> 00:23:41,812
See you

322
00:23:44,788 --> 00:23:45,663
Was it bad?

323
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:47,499
Don't worry

324
00:23:48,023 --> 00:23:48,968
They're having an affair, too.

325
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:55,273
We are same

326
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,671
You have an open mind.

327
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,468
You like me?

328
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:02,780
One coffee,please

329
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:03,671
Certainly

330
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:14,343
Welcome back

331
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:15,858
Our boss is not here

332
00:24:16,647 --> 00:24:17,124
I see

333
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:21,124
I got call from Ogino from Nanayo company

334
00:24:23,108 --> 00:24:26,148
He told me you come to his home tonight

335
00:24:26,702 --> 00:24:27,398
Is that all?

336
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:28,679
Yes

337
00:24:30,663 --> 00:24:31,351
I see

338
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,140
Your wife is not at home?

339
00:24:36,165 --> 00:24:38,218
She has urgent business in Shinjuku

340
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:40,468
Our house maid went back home

341
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:44,999
To be honest, I felt lonely so I called you

342
00:24:46,351 --> 00:24:49,343
I'm glad you invited me

343
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,101
Enjoy yourself

344
00:24:51,851 --> 00:24:54,733
By the way, you told me you want to be our
retailer agent

345
00:24:54,758 --> 00:24:56,101
Yes I want

346
00:24:56,687 --> 00:25:02,663
This might be rude, Funding is required for the agency
contract.

347
00:25:04,562 --> 00:25:11,905
Your partner, who pays the money, has the right
to run the business, and you become the servant.

348
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:14,359
I understand

349
00:25:14,507 --> 00:25:19,687
If you want to start your own business, we'll help you finance
it.

350
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,039
Are you sure?

351
00:25:22,226 --> 00:25:22,703
Yes

352
00:25:23,578 --> 00:25:26,601
By the way, what do you think about Setsuko
Kondo?

353
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,148
I have no idea

354
00:25:29,812 --> 00:25:32,304
She said you asked her out a few times

355
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:35,101
Oh, She is pure and nice woman

356
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,796
Her father is a scholar.

357
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:42,187
He used to give us a lot of advice.

358
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:46,000
And in return, I let her join us.

359
00:25:46,718 --> 00:25:50,780
She's a woman, and I want her to marry someone

360
00:25:50,805 --> 00:25:51,398
I see

361
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,914
Do you want to marry her?

362
00:25:56,523 --> 00:25:57,078
Me?

363
00:25:58,117 --> 00:26:04,953
Yes I know you very much, and if you marry her,
I will support you about your agent

364
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:08,125
Ah thanks

365
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:12,273
To be honest, I never think about that

366
00:26:13,335 --> 00:26:16,070
I've never known you to be so concerned about
her.

367
00:26:17,062 --> 00:26:22,781
Let me think about it, thank you anyway

368
00:26:23,085 --> 00:26:25,625
No problem.
I hope you think about her

369
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:29,320
Excuse me

370
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:52,351
I was relax but I got urgent business

371
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:53,367
Are you going out?

372
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:55,031
Someone will come here

373
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:56,531
You are very busy

374
00:26:57,413 --> 00:26:58,827
I'll go home

375
00:26:58,852 --> 00:27:04,140
It will be done in 15mins, you can wait here

376
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:06,796
I have time so it's ok to wait

377
00:27:07,171 --> 00:27:08,906
Now go and have a drink in my room

378
00:27:09,078 --> 00:27:09,757
I see

379
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:14,335
I will finish my work soon, so please wait

380
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:44,374
(Patent notification)

381
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:21,726
What are you doing?

382
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,335
What did you shoot?

383
00:29:25,718 --> 00:29:29,093
I just touched the camera

384
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:33,257
Don't lie.
You were filming it

385
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,077
You are a spy after all

386
00:29:42,593 --> 00:29:47,359
There was a tip-off at the company that you were an industrial spy who knew the secrets of paramizale.

387
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,991
I didn't make it a problem

388
00:29:49,421 --> 00:29:56,054
I thought you were indebted to me.
I thought you wouldn't betray me

389
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:01,585
What I was curious about was that you were approaching Setsuko Kondo

390
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:07,132
I didn't think you were interested in that sober woman

391
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:13,085
I talked about the agency, marriage to know your true intentions

392
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:16,304
You were confused

393
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,991
This is the last test I tried

394
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,296
Take it if you want

395
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:26,226
This is a fake to test you

396
00:30:27,772 --> 00:30:31,835
I also know the relationship between you and Eiko

397
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:34,421
That's not true.

398
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:35,476
You don't have to make an excuse

399
00:30:36,249 --> 00:30:40,851
She will be surprised to know your identity

400
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:41,960
Go home

401
00:30:43,304 --> 00:30:46,116
Don't show up in front of us again

402
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:49,273
Of course,  stay away from Ms. Kondo

403
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:53,695
You

404
00:30:56,163 --> 00:30:57,991
You are human scum.

405
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:05,476
You tried to spy on our friendship

406
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,359
I am very angry with you

407
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:26,179
He is stupid

408
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,429
I'm a human scum.

409
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:49,163
What happened?
You look down

410
00:31:50,085 --> 00:31:51,234
I'll go home

411
00:31:59,023 --> 00:31:59,523
Hello?

412
00:32:00,397 --> 00:32:01,397
Hello?

413
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:31,890
Oh you

414
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:36,538
What have you been doing since then?

415
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:39,187
It's not your business

416
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:43,374
I went to about three bars.

417
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,093
Tell me the truth

418
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:49,124
Did you kill Ogino?

419
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,398
Did I kill Ogino?

420
00:32:52,523 --> 00:32:55,366
There was a phone call from Eiko

421
00:32:56,249 --> 00:32:59,038
Ogino was killed?

422
00:33:06,022 --> 00:33:07,639
This is the weapon

423
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:10,320
It looks like the criminal hit him and strangled him

424
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,491
Did he has a visitor?

425
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:13,265
Yes

426
00:33:14,671 --> 00:33:17,874
Looking at the cup, there were at least 2,3 visitors

427
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,171
If we know the visitor, we will know the criminal immediately.

428
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,679
The first discoverer was his wife?

429
00:33:24,976 --> 00:33:25,601
Yes

430
00:33:26,234 --> 00:33:29,187
But she's in a state of confusion and can't talk now

431
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:31,624
You can talk to her sister

432
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:35,827
I knew there were customers

433
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,999
I don't know who that is.

434
00:33:38,523 --> 00:33:39,280
So?

435
00:33:41,084 --> 00:33:44,107
I was here this evening

436
00:33:45,951 --> 00:33:51,139
I'm sure there was a phone call from the company after 6 o'clock

437
00:33:51,764 --> 00:33:57,139
I was told to prepare sake and snacks because customers are coming

438
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,053
So?

439
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:04,420
My sister was going to visit her relatives

440
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:07,654
But she decided not to go if customers came

441
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:11,114
If they're going to have drinks with other men, she thought, she'd rather not have her.

442
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:17,318
So she went out

443
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:18,553
Manager

444
00:34:24,146 --> 00:34:25,560
I know who the customer was

445
00:34:25,881 --> 00:34:26,506
So quick

446
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:28,584
He heard the incident and rushed here

447
00:34:28,943 --> 00:34:29,646
Really?

448
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,466
From who?

449
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,099
Kazumi Yamaguchi

450
00:34:34,631 --> 00:34:35,404
Yamaguchi?

451
00:34:37,053 --> 00:34:38,615
Why she knows?

452
00:34:39,443 --> 00:34:42,131
She got call from Ogino's wife

453
00:34:42,584 --> 00:34:43,279
I see

454
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,139
You were classmate

455
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:57,553
Did you visit him because you had a promise?

456
00:34:57,578 --> 00:34:58,404
yes

457
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:05,115
We were going to discuss the agency contract

458
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:05,935
Then?

459
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:14,803
We were drinking but he got a call from his company and someone came

460
00:35:15,631 --> 00:35:17,646
Then I went home

461
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,498
Did you ask if anyone from the company is coming?

462
00:35:22,131 --> 00:35:22,865
No

463
00:35:24,224 --> 00:35:25,670
What time did you left?

464
00:35:26,373 --> 00:35:28,795
It was about 8 pm

465
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:31,123
What time did you hear the case from Yamaguchi?

466
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,178
I heard when I returned to my apartment after 10 o'clock

467
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:40,865
Talk to me about what you did between 8:00 and 10:00.

468
00:35:42,935 --> 00:35:45,381
I thought I'd take a detour.

469
00:35:46,139 --> 00:35:52,060
I called Ms. Yamaguchi from the public phone in front of this house.

470
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:58,060
Then I killed time in the cafeteria from 8:30 to 1 hour.

471
00:35:58,459 --> 00:35:59,881
The I separated with Yamaguchi

472
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,420
Then it's a little past 9 o'clock

473
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:05,467
Yes

474
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:10,974
Then I went to about 2 cafes by myself

475
00:36:12,021 --> 00:36:15,920
When I got home, Ms. Yamaguchi was there and told me about the incident.

476
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,365
OK I get it

477
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:26,889
I'm sorry, but please let me take your fingerprint for operation

478
00:36:27,412 --> 00:36:27,935
Yes

479
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:29,764
Please

480
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,982
Did you enter this room when you came then?

481
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,873
He showed me this room

482
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:46,092
Was there a camera on the desk at that time?

483
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:48,935
Camera?

484
00:36:55,178 --> 00:36:56,365
This camera

485
00:36:57,935 --> 00:37:00,428
Certainly it was

486
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,810
How is Eiko?

487
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:16,889
The potion put her to sleep.

488
00:37:17,553 --> 00:37:20,037
That's good to hear

489
00:37:23,412 --> 00:37:25,326
Hello, Fujita-san

490
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:27,537
Ah Nice to see you again

491
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:35,849
We are treated as suspects and unpleasant

492
00:37:36,764 --> 00:37:41,123
By the way
Don't you think Eiko is a little strange?

493
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,170
What?

494
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:46,826
She called the police and Toshiko

495
00:37:47,529 --> 00:37:52,553
Then she should have informed her relatives

496
00:37:53,334 --> 00:37:58,920
But she informed Kazumi first

497
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,631
It might be so

498
00:38:02,162 --> 00:38:05,662
I'm not blaming Kazumi

499
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:07,506
I’m sorry

500
00:38:08,310 --> 00:38:12,896
I think my sister was confused.
So she didn't let you know

501
00:38:13,592 --> 00:38:14,381
You think so?

502
00:38:14,974 --> 00:38:17,021
By the way Who is the culprit?

503
00:38:18,662 --> 00:38:22,935
We had a business rival, but I have no idea

504
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,029
How was his female relationship?

505
00:38:25,834 --> 00:38:30,310
He was OK.
His female relationship was normal

506
00:38:31,115 --> 00:38:35,943
You're the one who called me at 7:30, but what did you talk about?

507
00:38:36,381 --> 00:38:36,982
Please

508
00:38:41,209 --> 00:38:47,161
We asked for a loan, but we were planning to get the answer at 7 o'clock tonight.

509
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,178
I was told to report the contents 30 minutes later

510
00:38:51,826 --> 00:38:53,154
Then I called him

511
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:54,607
Was it at 8 pm?

512
00:38:55,076 --> 00:38:57,310
Yes just before 8 pm

513
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,326
Did you call him and come here?

514
00:39:00,537 --> 00:39:01,037
Me?

515
00:39:02,553 --> 00:39:06,959
No.
I was planning to report it at the company tomorrow

516
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,912
Where did you call from?

517
00:39:12,771 --> 00:39:15,279
A restaurant Erika in Akasaka

518
00:39:16,935 --> 00:39:20,451
You swear you're not the culprit

519
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:21,599
I swear

520
00:39:22,154 --> 00:39:28,092
This company is over when you find out that you are an industrial espionage

521
00:39:28,873 --> 00:39:30,959
So I called Kazumi to make a fake alibi.

522
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:35,982
he got a call at 8 o'clock.
It was past 8:30 when I had an argument with Ogino.

523
00:39:37,568 --> 00:39:39,506
Actions during this time are absolutely secret

524
00:39:40,193 --> 00:39:43,068
So He got a call and I decided to go home soon

525
00:39:43,974 --> 00:39:46,787
I used Kazumi for 30 minutes during that time.

526
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:50,420
But you called from Kazumi-san's bar

527
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:53,967
Don't worry about time.
She was off at that day

528
00:39:55,662 --> 00:40:00,310
Alibi camouflage is not good.
But It can't help but doing it

529
00:40:01,553 --> 00:40:06,193
If you find the true criminal, my fake alibi will be overlooked

530
00:40:06,873 --> 00:40:09,717
It's hard to find the real culprit

531
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:15,584
The person who came after I returned is the true criminal

532
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:21,310
And another key is...A whistleblower who taught him about me

533
00:40:23,006 --> 00:40:24,287
What is the whistleblower's aim?

534
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:27,404
I think it's about keeping me away from him

535
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:28,795
What do you mean?

536
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:31,670
Paramizale

537
00:40:32,342 --> 00:40:32,889
What?

538
00:40:34,068 --> 00:40:37,795
The Whistleblowers also want it

539
00:40:38,787 --> 00:40:40,771
I see, I get it

540
00:40:42,115 --> 00:40:46,037
But he didn't have to kill Ogino to trap you

541
00:40:46,928 --> 00:40:47,670
That's right

542
00:40:48,506 --> 00:40:51,779
I don't think the guilty flag and the guilty flag have anything to do with each other

543
00:40:53,224 --> 00:40:55,217
But I think they have some contact

544
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:59,631
If I know that, this case will be resolved

545
00:41:00,942 --> 00:41:05,841
No fingerprints were found on the weapon

546
00:41:06,474 --> 00:41:08,170
Did you get fingerprints from the camera and film?

547
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:10,396
Yes only Segawa and Ogino's

548
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,037
The fingerprints overlapped, but the victim's were on top.

549
00:41:16,428 --> 00:41:18,810
Victim touched the camera after Segawa

550
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:19,990
That's right

551
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,592
Manager! I've visited

552
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:23,435
Thanks

553
00:41:24,092 --> 00:41:25,248
Do you have any information?

554
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:30,111
The president was wondering.
He said there was no such loan offer.

555
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,127
Really?

556
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:32,518
He said that

557
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,119
Is Fujita's testimony a lie?

558
00:41:35,775 --> 00:41:38,353
Ok, we should investigate Fujita

559
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,236
Are you going home,Segawa-san

560
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:01,150
Humans are mysterious creatures

561
00:43:02,385 --> 00:43:03,853
Did you meet him last night?

562
00:43:04,893 --> 00:43:09,158
It feels like he was killed because I returned early

563
00:43:10,276 --> 00:43:11,651
You don't have to care too much

564
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:16,229
Because you haven’t had a quarrel.
You don't have to feel responsible

565
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:22,745
By the way There was a quarrel at the board meeting yesterday.
Do you know?

566
00:43:23,987 --> 00:43:24,612
No

567
00:43:25,752 --> 00:43:32,463
Shouichi-kun and Furuwsaka depending on whether to mass-produce and sell new products
There was a great quarrel between

568
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:35,010
It was a very quarrel

569
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:41,049
Shouichi-kun is secretly advancing the matter of the loan partner

570
00:43:41,643 --> 00:43:44,768
Secretary Fujita leaked it

571
00:43:47,432 --> 00:43:48,948
He is Furuwsaka

572
00:43:56,862 --> 00:43:57,854
I'm sorry

573
00:44:01,112 --> 00:44:01,760
You

574
00:44:09,791 --> 00:44:10,768
Segawa-san

575
00:44:13,159 --> 00:44:13,885
Do you gave time?

576
00:44:20,221 --> 00:44:22,643
Eiko said she will contact you later

577
00:44:24,487 --> 00:44:29,151
Tell her to get better and trust me

578
00:44:29,674 --> 00:44:31,104
I know she trusts you

579
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:35,862
What can I do for you?

580
00:44:36,526 --> 00:44:37,440
I forgot my bag

581
00:44:39,666 --> 00:44:42,502
I wonder if I made a mistake in the room.
I'm sorry

582
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:49,448
He is nasty.
He is checking around

583
00:44:51,229 --> 00:44:57,213
By the way,The police came in the morning and asked me about you and your sister

584
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:00,909
I think Sadako talked them

585
00:45:03,213 --> 00:45:04,049
Sadako?

586
00:45:21,971 --> 00:45:22,721
What's wrong?

587
00:45:23,627 --> 00:45:25,307
I'm being followed

588
00:45:30,768 --> 00:45:31,831
Are you OK?

589
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:34,518
I'm OK

590
00:45:45,745 --> 00:45:49,057
If you don't do it early, they'll know the alibi

591
00:45:49,127 --> 00:45:51,823
I know.
Eventually they'll know

592
00:45:53,174 --> 00:45:55,659
I have to find the criminal by then

593
00:45:57,791 --> 00:46:02,120
Do your best even if the police pursue,Kazumi

594
00:46:02,541 --> 00:46:03,034
Yes

595
00:46:06,612 --> 00:46:12,026
Who and who knows that you are approaching Ogino knowing the paramizale?

596
00:46:13,127 --> 00:46:14,182
Only Sawai

597
00:46:14,385 --> 00:46:15,448
It's impossible

598
00:46:16,252 --> 00:46:19,151
Because the whistleblower also said that

599
00:46:20,682 --> 00:46:21,495
Oh yeah

600
00:46:23,776 --> 00:46:24,745
I get it

601
00:46:26,502 --> 00:46:27,932
Who's the whistleblower?

602
00:46:29,284 --> 00:46:30,776
If we know the whistleblower,we know the criminal

603
00:46:31,557 --> 00:46:35,096
But Secretary Fujita is very suspicious

604
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:40,534
He called that night.
That phone call was a trap, too?

605
00:46:42,752 --> 00:46:44,588
Ogino was so upset

606
00:46:46,104 --> 00:46:50,182
The cup proves that I was there

607
00:46:51,526 --> 00:46:55,127
Are the whistleblower and the criminal the same person?

608
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:56,088
It's impossible

609
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:59,737
The interests of the informant and the killer are opposed.

610
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:01,924
Yes

611
00:47:03,424 --> 00:47:05,948
There is no doubt that the criminal is an official of Nanayou company

612
00:47:14,893 --> 00:47:16,987
I have to leave for urgent business

613
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:20,073
Please lock the door when you go out

614
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,831
I have another key so it ’s okay.

615
00:47:39,198 --> 00:47:41,338
Hello?
This is Segawa

616
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:44,643
Hello? what?

617
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:46,971
Who?

618
00:47:47,495 --> 00:47:50,002
What? you are not Shinwa company?

619
00:47:50,752 --> 00:47:55,635
It's me.
Who knows about my purpose other than you

620
00:47:56,721 --> 00:47:59,424
There is a person who has informed me as I'm spy

621
00:48:00,198 --> 00:48:01,643
Hello? can you wait?

622
00:48:02,831 --> 00:48:06,463
Polyethylene material will arrive today

623
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:10,331
Yes, it works well

624
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:15,635
I'm having visitors, so I'll call you later.

625
00:48:16,666 --> 00:48:18,823
Yes please

626
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,002


627
00:48:48,596 --> 00:48:49,151
Why?Did the detective who came yesterday asked you anything other than Eiko?

628
00:48:50,815 --> 00:48:51,987
They were at my company?

629
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:54,776
Did your alibi get caught?

630
00:48:56,729 --> 00:49:01,034
You told them You called Kazumi from a pay phone in front of my house that night

631
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:05,838
But that phone was out of order

632
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:06,979
What?

633
00:49:07,659 --> 00:49:09,635
Of course I won't tell anyone

634
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:14,799
But Why did you have to create a fake alibi?

635
00:49:17,299 --> 00:49:21,127
No way, do you doubt me?

636
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:25,143
It's impossible I don't doubt you perfectly

637
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:32,987
Sorry to ask but can you trust Kazumi-san?

638
00:49:34,245 --> 00:49:35,026
Why?

639
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:40,901
I don't understand why Ms. Kazumi helped you create an
alibi.

640
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:46,143
No way she is the criminal?

641
00:49:47,167 --> 00:49:47,901
Kazumi?

642
00:49:48,354 --> 00:49:52,573
She may be pretending to help you so she can help
herself.

643
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,198
She has no motive to kill him.

644
00:49:55,354 --> 00:49:58,127
She has.
She wants revenge on Ogino.

645
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,487
revenge?

646
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:07,229
Kazumi loved Ogino but Ogino married her sister

647
00:50:08,979 --> 00:50:16,846
She was pretending to be nice, but inside she was
frustrated.

648
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:22,596
And that's why she became a hostess.

649
00:50:24,456 --> 00:50:25,581
Am I think too much?

650
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,081
Kazumi?

651
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:33,963
No way, but by any chance she might be the
whistleblower

652
00:50:35,299 --> 00:50:42,174
The whistleblower's real goal may not be
industrial espionage, but to destroy the Oginos.

653
00:50:48,596 --> 00:50:49,518
I'm leaving now

654
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,135
It hurts me!
Fuck you!

655
00:52:35,924 --> 00:52:37,307
Did you find him?

656
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:43,330
Yes this guy! I'm sure this guy!

657
00:52:43,355 --> 00:52:44,854
You found so quick

658
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:46,534
Yes this guy

659
00:52:46,995 --> 00:52:48,104
For sure

660
00:52:48,401 --> 00:52:51,487
He ran away when I said I fuck you

661
00:52:51,512 --> 00:52:52,284
Thanks

662
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:55,150
It's shame I knew this, I could catch him

663
00:52:56,362 --> 00:52:57,737
Imamura,
Put an APB out on him.

664
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,057
This is the task force.

665
00:53:00,971 --> 00:53:03,651
Manager, call from Kojima cop

666
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:07,229
I'm Ishida,
Thanks for your work

667
00:53:08,088 --> 00:53:12,737
We've put out an APB on Segawa now.

668
00:53:14,081 --> 00:53:16,995
We don't know Segawa's motive for the crime.

669
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,526
Oh I see, I'll go there

670
00:53:21,021 --> 00:53:24,450
No one saw Segawa choke her.

671
00:53:25,279 --> 00:53:28,435
Segawa just left the room.

672
00:53:29,091 --> 00:53:31,185
Of course, that's what we are going to
investigate.

673
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:34,388
So we need your help

674
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:36,622
I trust Segawa completely

675
00:53:37,591 --> 00:53:42,896
Segawa was suspected in the recent incident, and I was not happy about
it.

676
00:53:43,825 --> 00:53:47,669
I want you to talk the truth

677
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:49,240
the truth?

678
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:50,630
Yes

679
00:53:51,825 --> 00:54:00,060
You've hired Segawa with good benefits
despite his poor performance as a salesman.

680
00:54:01,302 --> 00:54:03,029
Isn't that a pretense?

681
00:54:03,630 --> 00:54:06,771
Well....I have no idea

682
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,950
Please say clearly

683
00:54:09,669 --> 00:54:10,341
Then I'll say

684
00:54:11,716 --> 00:54:13,700
You're letting Segawa spy on your industry.

685
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:17,646
No way, Is there any evidence?

686
00:54:23,943 --> 00:54:27,755
As you may know,This is a special lens for
espionage.

687
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:34,193
It was at the scene of the incident.
Segawa's fingerprints were on it.

688
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,193
So what?

689
00:54:37,067 --> 00:54:41,325
This doesn't prove that Segawa is the killer.

690
00:54:41,544 --> 00:54:44,177
If he's not the culprit, why is Segawa on the
run?

691
00:54:45,122 --> 00:54:47,185
He might be afraid of police

692
00:54:48,146 --> 00:54:50,794
There's been a lot of unjustified arrests
lately.

693
00:54:51,365 --> 00:54:53,427
Sawai-san, Are you making fun of us?

694
00:54:53,452 --> 00:54:54,279
Ishida-san

695
00:54:54,818 --> 00:54:57,802
Please let us know if Segawa call you

696
00:54:58,833 --> 00:54:59,575
Certainly

697
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:09,575
Sorry to disturb you

698
00:55:32,575 --> 00:55:34,169
You are completely suspected

699
00:55:34,966 --> 00:55:38,380
You should hide until the criminal is caught

700
00:55:38,747 --> 00:55:42,153
But in this case I'm definitely not the culprit

701
00:55:46,075 --> 00:55:50,099
I'll give you 100,000 yen.
Use this money to run away

702
00:55:50,606 --> 00:55:51,997
I will send you money if you contact me

703
00:55:54,091 --> 00:55:55,021
I won't run away

704
00:55:55,153 --> 00:55:56,130
What are you talking about?

705
00:55:56,653 --> 00:56:01,614
If you get caught, I'm in danger too

706
00:56:04,544 --> 00:56:06,271
But I'm not really the culprit

707
00:56:07,403 --> 00:56:11,536
If I run away, I may be the culprit

708
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,208
I used to be a guy who did everything for money

709
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:26,817
Kazumi and Ogino were killed in front of me and I was about to be the criminal.

710
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,341
I can't stand

711
00:56:30,606 --> 00:56:34,622
I try to catch the criminal myself

712
00:56:35,552 --> 00:56:40,755
But you're a wanted man.

713
00:56:42,505 --> 00:56:44,138
If I get caught, that's it

714
00:56:44,403 --> 00:56:46,567
You must not be caught

715
00:56:47,716 --> 00:56:52,802
Use this money to hide for a while.
Police is not stupid

716
00:56:53,849 --> 00:56:55,739
Please do your best until the criminal is caught

717
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:03,224
Please be sure to contact me

718
00:57:04,396 --> 00:57:06,685
You change clothes

719
00:57:07,919 --> 00:57:08,716
I know

720
00:57:26,091 --> 00:57:26,817
No worry

721
00:57:56,114 --> 00:57:57,177
Absolutely I'm not

722
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,489
The criminal is the same as the one who killed Ogino

723
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:04,216
I try to catch the criminal myself

724
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:07,489
Hello?

725
00:58:09,169 --> 00:58:12,919
Please do not let Eiko know about this

726
00:58:13,614 --> 00:58:16,075
She has already seen the newspaper

727
00:58:17,856 --> 00:58:18,646
Really?

728
00:58:18,896 --> 00:58:22,388
She suffered from brain anemia and collapsed

729
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:26,333
She is fine now

730
00:58:27,372 --> 00:58:30,138
I'll talk about you.
Where are you now?

731
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,560
Eh?

732
00:58:34,028 --> 00:58:35,396
You are there?

733
00:58:36,669 --> 00:58:38,271
I'll hide here for a while.

734
00:58:39,036 --> 00:58:42,810
I try to catch the criminal myself

735
00:58:49,731 --> 00:58:51,505
Ah, Hello?

736
00:58:59,974 --> 00:59:00,747
Like this

737
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:16,419
Segawa is following us

738
00:59:17,044 --> 00:59:17,778
Don't look at him

739
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,170
Don't look at him

740
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,286
Damn it.
He noticed

741
01:00:05,341 --> 01:00:05,841
Hey

742
01:01:01,911 --> 01:01:03,028
Are you going to turn yourself in to the police?

743
01:01:03,911 --> 01:01:06,286
It's no good.
The hard work up to now will be wasted

744
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:08,396
I can't move

745
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:12,833
I think I should tell the police everything

746
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:17,466
Please think again.
Let's meet with me and discuss it.

747
01:01:19,981 --> 01:01:20,903
The night is better

748
01:01:21,661 --> 01:01:24,708
But it ’s dangerous to go to your office.

749
01:01:25,903 --> 01:01:27,403
Police are sometimes near our office

750
01:01:28,911 --> 01:01:32,083
Shall we meet at Jingu Gaien?
South exit of the second stadium

751
01:01:32,849 --> 01:01:35,685
Yes at 8 pm

752
01:01:36,216 --> 01:01:36,911
OK?

753
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:26,880
Watch out,Segawa!

754
01:02:27,458 --> 01:02:28,294
Run away!

755
01:03:22,896 --> 01:03:24,810
Police!

756
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,340
She seems to be able to sleep in the daytime

757
01:03:49,365 --> 01:03:50,099
I see

758
01:03:50,942 --> 01:03:53,685
She's been neurotic since that incident

759
01:03:54,442 --> 01:03:58,497
She may get seriously ill

760
01:03:59,911 --> 01:04:02,638
Why don't you invite her to a foreign trip for a change?

761
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:04,560
That's good idea

762
01:04:08,888 --> 01:04:15,216
The more you say that Mr. Segawa is not the culprit, the more the result will be the opposite.

763
01:04:16,591 --> 01:04:19,106
Where is Segawa now?

764
01:04:19,411 --> 01:04:20,176
I don't know

765
01:04:20,575 --> 01:04:21,106
You sure?

766
01:04:21,974 --> 01:04:25,927
I don't tell you even if I know,because you may be a police spy

767
01:04:25,952 --> 01:04:27,497
You are too bad

768
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:35,192
If something happens to Mr. Segawa, my sister may die

769
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:40,091
I introduced my sister Segawa-san

770
01:04:41,575 --> 01:04:44,317
It's also my responsibility

771
01:04:49,903 --> 01:04:50,864
Who is it?

772
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:52,927
Excuse me

773
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:05,278
Sadako is here, she wants to see my sis

774
01:05:05,303 --> 01:05:06,575
Oh my god

775
01:05:07,185 --> 01:05:09,442
Don't go home please

776
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:20,567
What are you saying?
Do you think I killed Ogino?

777
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:22,310
Because you are a scary woman

778
01:05:22,771 --> 01:05:28,153
You conspired with your lover to take his property, and you killed him.

779
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:31,177
Stop saying it!
You are too bad

780
01:05:31,849 --> 01:05:35,856
He was killed.
I'm right to say it

781
01:05:36,966 --> 01:05:42,044
You're trying to be nice.
I don't want to see your face

782
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:45,919
If you have a conscience, please call the police yourself.

783
01:05:46,286 --> 01:05:48,044
But you don't have such a conscience

784
01:05:48,622 --> 01:05:49,724
Go home

785
01:05:49,888 --> 01:05:52,849
Here is sister's house,
go home now

786
01:05:53,013 --> 01:05:55,442
Of course, I go home!

787
01:05:55,872 --> 01:05:59,216
You are a really bad person

788
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:04,255
This case will be resolved in a little while.

789
01:06:10,044 --> 01:06:10,950
Eiko...

790
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:13,536
Eiko...

791
01:06:28,192 --> 01:06:31,958
Even so, I didn't think Sadako was such a terrible woman.

792
01:06:33,458 --> 01:06:36,646
Women are scared when they get angry

793
01:06:37,403 --> 01:06:39,521
Women are especially strong when property issues are involved.

794
01:06:39,817 --> 01:06:40,896
property issues?

795
01:06:41,146 --> 01:06:41,638
Yes

796
01:06:41,911 --> 01:06:44,325
It's legally resolved

797
01:06:44,825 --> 01:06:47,747
Eiko takes 2/3, Sadako takes 1/3

798
01:06:49,177 --> 01:06:50,786
If it is as it is

799
01:06:51,255 --> 01:06:52,997
What do you mean?

800
01:06:54,364 --> 01:06:55,364
Can't we talk by phone?

801
01:06:56,341 --> 01:06:57,591
It's very important

802
01:06:59,927 --> 01:07:04,614
Can I meet you in Shibuya because I also want to hear important things?

803
01:07:05,349 --> 01:07:08,239
I'm ok but Eiko will be alone

804
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:12,466
No worry, she took a pill so she is fine now

805
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:16,513
Let's meet 2F of Bon at 3 pm

806
01:07:17,192 --> 01:07:18,028
Is that Ok?

807
01:07:19,294 --> 01:07:23,224
I think Sadako got angry on propose

808
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:24,536
What kind?

809
01:07:25,263 --> 01:07:27,481
It's a case of inheritance by murder.

810
01:07:27,817 --> 01:07:31,552
If the heir is criminally liable

811
01:07:33,224 --> 01:07:38,341
In other words, when Eiko is an accomplice.

812
01:07:39,825 --> 01:07:42,692
In that case, the right to inherit the inheritance will be lost.

813
01:07:44,146 --> 01:07:47,388
Then all of Ogino's heritage will belong to Sadako.

814
01:07:49,255 --> 01:07:51,536
I didn't know that

815
01:07:52,653 --> 01:07:57,724
Sadako suddenly spoke.
I hope someone can help her

816
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:58,864
Support her?

817
01:08:00,591 --> 01:08:02,575
The criminal is surely that person

818
01:08:03,895 --> 01:08:04,692
I think so

819
01:08:08,286 --> 01:08:10,552
Can we meet again?

820
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:15,565
I want to tell my sister that story and encourage her

821
01:08:31,768 --> 01:08:34,057
It smells like gas

822
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:34,675
Eh?

823
01:08:35,682 --> 01:08:36,557
Upstairs

824
01:08:44,511 --> 01:08:45,456
Eiko!

825
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Eiko!

826
01:08:52,261 --> 01:08:53,261
Eiko!

827
01:08:54,979 --> 01:08:55,979
Eiko!

828
01:08:57,003 --> 01:08:59,089
Let's call an ambulance anyway

829
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:00,557
Wait

830
01:09:00,994 --> 01:09:03,635
I feel sorry for my sister when everyone knows this

831
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:05,791
I can call my doctor

832
01:09:05,816 --> 01:09:07,214
Take care of her

833
01:09:07,378 --> 01:09:09,386
Wake up, Eiko!

834
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:21,432
Wake up, Eiko!

835
01:09:23,401 --> 01:09:25,518
Get well, Eiko

836
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,096
I'm sorry I left home

837
01:09:31,425 --> 01:09:33,425
This didn't happen

838
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,229
I'll answer

839
01:09:45,417 --> 01:09:46,221
Hello?

840
01:09:47,299 --> 01:09:47,948
It's me

841
01:09:47,973 --> 01:09:50,050
Ah? who?

842
01:09:51,043 --> 01:09:52,043
Hello?

843
01:09:53,028 --> 01:09:54,176
Are you Segawa?

844
01:09:55,121 --> 01:09:58,332
Eiko tried to commit suicide by gas

845
01:09:59,457 --> 01:10:00,457
Hello?

846
01:10:00,715 --> 01:10:01,590
Can you hear?

847
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:04,832
Hello?

848
01:10:05,137 --> 01:10:06,137
Hello?

849
01:10:07,864 --> 01:10:09,981
I need to use the phone

850
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,785
Damn it

851
01:10:18,996 --> 01:10:21,528
Eiko tried to commit suicide because of everyone

852
01:10:24,574 --> 01:10:25,574
Damn it

853
01:10:44,824 --> 01:10:45,754
I have to find the whistleblower

854
01:10:47,129 --> 01:10:49,371
Whistleblower forced Eiko to commit suicide

855
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:55,449
It was all because of the whistleblower that Ogino and Kazumi were killed and that I did this.

856
01:10:57,981 --> 01:10:58,817
I have to find the whistleblower

857
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:01,535
Secretary Fujita?

858
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:05,270
He may have a reason to kill Ogino but

859
01:11:06,770 --> 01:11:09,145
He has no reason to kill Kazumi

860
01:11:10,856 --> 01:11:13,629
Who knew I was a spy

861
01:11:15,965 --> 01:11:17,395
Kazumi said the same thing

862
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:20,129
Kazumi said the whistleblower and the criminal were the same person

863
01:11:21,528 --> 01:11:23,145
And the next day Kazumi was killed

864
01:11:25,645 --> 01:11:28,856
Police did not attack me at Jingu Gaien

865
01:11:30,973 --> 01:11:34,942
Who knew I was going to Jingu Gaien

866
01:11:42,309 --> 01:11:44,098
Are you doctor?

867
01:11:44,653 --> 01:11:47,558
Yes,Are the sick people upstairs?

868
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:48,090
Yes

869
01:12:06,137 --> 01:12:06,989
Segawa-san

870
01:12:07,176 --> 01:12:08,035
keep quiet

871
01:12:08,762 --> 01:12:09,762
keep quiet

872
01:12:12,551 --> 01:12:13,418
How's Eiko?

873
01:12:14,004 --> 01:12:17,004
She's okay because she was discovered early

874
01:12:17,824 --> 01:12:18,887
upstairs?

875
01:12:19,121 --> 01:12:20,582
Wait Segawa

876
01:12:21,379 --> 01:12:22,926
A doctor is here

877
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:36,098
You think I'm the culprit

878
01:12:36,832 --> 01:12:38,629
No..but...

879
01:12:39,598 --> 01:12:42,731
You are the one who forced Eiko to commit suicide

880
01:12:45,449 --> 01:12:48,535
I was hiding until today because I wanted to find the culprit myself

881
01:12:49,809 --> 01:12:52,692
I found the culprit

882
01:12:53,004 --> 01:12:54,762
Eh? who?

883
01:12:58,371 --> 01:12:59,676
Segawa-san...

884
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,762
Eiko, Are you OK?

885
01:13:03,153 --> 01:13:04,153
Eiko

886
01:13:04,614 --> 01:13:05,654
Segawa-san...

887
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:10,215
Bring brandy or wine

888
01:13:11,309 --> 01:13:11,895
Yes

889
01:13:33,442 --> 01:13:34,332
Segawa-san...

890
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:35,965
Doctor is here?

891
01:13:36,543 --> 01:13:37,317
Yes

892
01:13:41,512 --> 01:13:42,692
I have no time

893
01:13:43,793 --> 01:13:45,059
I need to meet her

894
01:13:45,449 --> 01:13:46,489
Segawa-san...

895
01:13:52,231 --> 01:13:53,106
You!

896
01:14:06,246 --> 01:14:06,957
Wait!

897
01:14:12,676 --> 01:14:14,293
Call police!

898
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:16,043
He is the culprit

899
01:14:29,449 --> 01:14:30,449
Wait!

900
01:14:37,879 --> 01:14:38,543
Damn it!

901
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:12,239
Wait!

902
01:15:57,004 --> 01:15:57,801
Take your seat

903
01:15:59,590 --> 01:16:02,496
Why did you guys bring me here?

904
01:16:02,973 --> 01:16:04,965
Let's sit down and talk about it.

905
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:06,887
My sister is sick

906
01:16:07,489 --> 01:16:08,856
I need to go home

907
01:16:09,668 --> 01:16:11,520
We can't let you go home

908
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:13,403
Why?

909
01:16:15,621 --> 01:16:18,278
Persuade him,Segawa-san

910
01:16:19,223 --> 01:16:23,653
Who will take responsibility if something happens to my sister?

911
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:29,199
You are hoping that Eiko will die

912
01:16:31,121 --> 01:16:31,848
I am?

913
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:35,449
Am I hoping that Eiko will die?

914
01:16:36,613 --> 01:16:40,246
To get the property of the Ogino family

915
01:16:41,402 --> 01:16:42,332
You tried kill her

916
01:16:42,410 --> 01:16:44,332
Don't say stupid things

917
01:16:44,863 --> 01:16:47,691
I was more worried about my sister than anyone else.

918
01:16:47,957 --> 01:16:49,895
You know that too, right?

919
01:16:50,316 --> 01:16:52,824
That was the blind spot in this case

920
01:16:53,590 --> 01:16:56,981
We have fallen into that blind spot

921
01:16:59,074 --> 01:16:59,848
Come in

922
01:17:06,277 --> 01:17:10,270
Your lover confessed as an accomplice

923
01:17:11,848 --> 01:17:15,981
Mikio Sawai confessed that he was involved in the murder of Mr. Ogino, Ms. Yamaguchi and

924
01:17:16,973 --> 01:17:20,395
 and his sister.
He was collusion with you

925
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,207
I don't know

926
01:17:21,809 --> 01:17:24,590
Whatever he says. I know nothing

927
01:17:24,615 --> 01:17:25,481
Don't pretend you don't know

928
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:28,520
You wanted the property of the Ogino family,right?

929
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:33,199
First, you killed Mr. Ogino and transferred all my property to his wife Eiko.

930
01:17:33,629 --> 01:17:36,559
Then you tried to kill Eiko and take her fortune.

931
01:17:36,584 --> 01:17:37,395
Is that right?

932
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:38,746
No....

933
01:17:38,771 --> 01:17:39,770
Confess!

934
01:17:40,848 --> 01:17:45,574
If Eiko's discovery was a little later, your plan might have succeeded.

935
01:17:46,918 --> 01:17:51,715
You tried to kill her by making your accomplice a fake doctor, so this plan failed.

936
01:17:54,199 --> 01:17:55,184
It's all crap

937
01:17:56,582 --> 01:18:00,418
This man tried to kill them all.

938
01:18:01,168 --> 01:18:02,590
I know nothing

939
01:18:02,824 --> 01:18:04,402
I don't know him

940
01:18:05,324 --> 01:18:07,770
I was deceived

941
01:18:07,910 --> 01:18:09,363
This man tried to kill them all.

942
01:18:32,426 --> 01:18:33,059
Imamura-kun

943
01:18:38,106 --> 01:18:40,856
Well.....let's go

944
01:18:46,770 --> 01:18:49,285
The cause of this incident was money

945
01:18:50,691 --> 01:18:53,645
I thought the criminal had no motivation to kill Mr. Ogino

946
01:18:55,621 --> 01:18:57,324
This was the problem until the end

947
01:18:59,145 --> 01:19:01,832
Segawa-san suffered the worst.

948
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:06,043
You were hired as a criminal from the beginning

949
01:19:06,231 --> 01:19:08,895
And you were raised from him

950
01:19:10,762 --> 01:19:13,668
Thinking about it now, I should have noticed when Kazumi was killed

951
01:19:15,129 --> 01:19:20,082
Kazumi made it clear that the whistleblower was the killer.

952
01:19:20,597 --> 01:19:23,996
By the way Toshiko is a perfect bad woman

953
01:19:24,699 --> 01:19:25,340
But

954
01:19:26,738 --> 01:19:30,410
I think the real cause of this crime was in Toshiko's heart.

955
01:19:33,324 --> 01:19:33,902
So?

956
01:19:35,598 --> 01:19:36,746
Toshiko Murozaki is

957
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:39,715
She was born as a shaded girl

958
01:19:40,871 --> 01:19:47,511
So, deep down inside her, she felt inferior to Eiko.

959
01:20:00,988 --> 01:20:02,754
Have a safe trip

960
01:20:04,942 --> 01:20:09,785
I will go abroad and refresh my mind

961
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:13,442
I will start over again

962
01:20:15,215 --> 01:20:18,043
I will definitely recover by the time you come back

963
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:20,301
Yes

964
01:20:26,309 --> 01:20:29,723
Let's be happy with me next time

965
01:20:34,113 --> 01:20:34,754
See you

966
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:04,082
Finish

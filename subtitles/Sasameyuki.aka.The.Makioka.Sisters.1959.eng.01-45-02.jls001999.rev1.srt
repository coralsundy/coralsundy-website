<i>Sasameyuki / The Makioka Sisters (1959)</i>

3
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,070
Hello, Sis.

4
00:02:49,688 --> 00:02:51,656
Where's your mom?

5
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:53,734
She's at home.

6
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,070
I brought a gift

7
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,750
Hello.

8
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:10,920
Akan-chan, are you going somewhere? Yes

9
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,139
I bought tickets to the concert

10
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,746
My brother is waiting for me at the Osaka office

11
00:03:16,771 --> 00:03:19,094
Do you use that belt?

12
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:22,336
You also used that belt during the piano concert other day.

13
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:23,070
Yes.

14
00:03:23,148 --> 00:03:30,031
I was sitting next to you and your belt looked very tight.

15
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:31,781
Really?

16
00:03:32,664 --> 00:03:34,039
Please turn off the radio

17
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,078
Yeah this is bad.

18
00:03:51,328 --> 00:03:51,969
No?

19
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,203
No.

20
00:03:53,547 --> 00:03:55,608
I'll show you my good one.

21
00:03:57,499 --> 00:04:00,163
I want a souvenir

22
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:05,054
Please stay in this house tonight.

23
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:08,492
I get it. You have homework

24
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:09,844
Yes.

25
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,804
That's what I thought.

26
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:14,495
So, just play around and write it properly

27
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,335
I'll show you later.

28
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:17,617
Try this.

29
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:19,844
Try this?

30
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,250
Hold on.

31
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,507
This is no good either.

32
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,281
I get it.
This is too new.

33
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:37,500
Really?

34
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:40,828
Try this.

35
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:52,195
Is this ok?

36
00:04:52,474 --> 00:04:54,841
This doesn't feel tight at all

37
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:58,265
This belt is old and very easy to use.

38
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,554
I see.

39
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:01,617
You should use your brain a little

40
00:05:01,642 --> 00:05:02,789
Yeah.

41
00:05:03,766 --> 00:05:04,984
It's already this late.

42
00:05:05,506 --> 00:05:08,601
I've already given our workers over to my workplace

43
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:09,891
I'm not ready.

44
00:05:10,421 --> 00:05:12,495
I will thank you later

45
00:05:13,621 --> 00:05:17,578
Hehe, I know everything, and if you don't have any pocket money, I'll lend it to you

46
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,328
That's a lie.

47
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:23,891
Kan-chan.

48
00:05:25,253 --> 00:05:28,253
Have you been dating Keibon lately?

49
00:05:29,359 --> 00:05:30,266
Keibon?

50
00:05:31,618 --> 00:05:34,703
Why do you say such things?

51
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:39,461
Thank you for waiting.

52
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:40,875
It's really late.

53
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:41,820
Sorry.

54
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:07,578
I get it.

55
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,984
Please come home soon

56
00:06:11,555 --> 00:06:14,992
Wait, I have something to say.

57
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:20,304
Don't forget any souvenirs

58
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:27,343
Despite all my efforts to tighten your belt, the concert was unfortunately canceled.

59
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,906
But I can't help it

60
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:31,632
Due to work reasons,

61
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:35,906
I think your sister at home is having a very hard time.

62
00:06:36,164 --> 00:06:37,609
Are you okay without being at home?

63
00:06:38,046 --> 00:06:39,775
She said she'd do everything herself

64
00:06:39,975 --> 00:06:41,640
She won't let me help her with anything.

65
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,406
That's so her.

66
00:06:44,836 --> 00:06:46,453
Be careful.

67
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,219
Nakan-chan.

68
00:06:57,218 --> 00:07:02,265
I have to go to Tokyo with the main family?

69
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,398
You don't like?

70
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,132
I don't want to go

71
00:07:05,867 --> 00:07:07,765
I can't get along with my brothers.

72
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,120
I feel like the water in Tokyo just doesn't seem to suit my tastes

73
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,556
But if no one goes

74
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:18,678
I think your sister feels lonely.

75
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,843
That's true, but if I end up being a nuisance to anyone,

76
00:07:25,014 --> 00:07:26,976
I want you to be a nuisance to you.

77
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,773
I'll also take care of Etsuko-chan

78
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:31,707
Eventually, I will be able to earn money like Koi-san

79
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,966
So please.

80
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,990
I would be grateful if Yukiko-chan could stay here

81
00:07:37,657 --> 00:07:39,390
Well then, please

82
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:45,070
But more importantly, why don't you take a blind date?

83
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,171
There is a very good marriage proposal.

84
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,226
about Jinba-san?

85
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:55,570
You knew it.

86
00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:00,630
It's been four years since the first person I met had that happen

87
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,584
And this is a good offer.

88
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,488
You might like him.

89
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:08,161
So please think about it

90
00:08:08,746 --> 00:08:11,746
but I know how Nakan-chan feels

91
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:14,256
I'm really happy about it but...

92
00:08:15,031 --> 00:08:16,825
I know how you feel too.

93
00:08:17,446 --> 00:08:24,596
Yuko-chan, everyone really want you to find happiness as soon as possible

94
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,632
I'm not telling you to forget about your past.

95
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:33,006
so please give it some thought

96
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:34,877
I will.

97
00:08:35,066 --> 00:08:35,659
Good.

98
00:08:36,758 --> 00:08:39,265
Anyway, I'm going to the main house now to check on your sister

99
00:08:39,818 --> 00:08:42,442
I've already made the kimono, so it's nice to see her

100
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:15,668
Oh she's here.

101
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,367
Hello

102
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,241
you're bringing something so big.

103
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:24,074
Let's go.

104
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,363
Hold on.

105
00:09:32,198 --> 00:09:33,078
Welcome.

106
00:09:33,258 --> 00:09:34,218
Hello.

107
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:38,591
Oh you are here.

108
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:39,971
Hello.

109
00:09:40,861 --> 00:09:42,621
There're many stuff here.

110
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,158
You seems to be doing fine.

111
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,588
I thought you'd be crying like crazy

112
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,305
Ah, I'm so tense while I'm doing this,

113
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,546
but I think that once I get to Tokyo I'll relax and start crying

114
00:09:57,735 --> 00:09:59,187
This is Suzuri.

115
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,095
I remember my dad making me buy this.

116
00:10:03,142 --> 00:10:03,948
Is that right?

117
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,420
It cost hundreds of yen in those days

118
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,497
Because my dad loved expensive stuff.

119
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:13,408
He was like that.

120
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:15,409
So his Business was going badly.

121
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,884
He was complaint about the world.

122
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,997
Are you taking these to Tokyo?

123
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,439
No, I'm thinking of selling them.

124
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:25,043
Why?

125
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:28,571
If I take such a luxury item, It doesn't fit into my life from now on.

126
00:10:28,705 --> 00:10:31,511
What a fool! This smells like my dad.

127
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,348
It's ridiculous and the smell alone is not enough to make me eat

128
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,562
Since you are decided to go to Tokyo, you have changed yourself.

129
00:10:39,076 --> 00:10:39,955
What do you mean?

130
00:10:40,075 --> 00:10:44,654
You've always said that hearts are precious.

131
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,940
I said that, but now it's important to eat,

132
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,387
You might be right.

133
00:10:53,071 --> 00:10:54,967
This is my favorite.

134
00:10:55,329 --> 00:10:58,020
I'll give it to you, take good care of it.

135
00:10:59,497 --> 00:11:00,322
What else.

136
00:11:00,742 --> 00:11:02,700
I want something more.

137
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,205
You're greedy.

138
00:11:07,212 --> 00:11:08,296
Here's album.

139
00:11:08,321 --> 00:11:10,476
Wow, a rare award came out

140
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:16,295
Sister, Look, this is our mother. She was beautiful woman.

141
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,785
This is Koi-san,right?

142
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:26,838
Oh yeah.

143
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:31,097
At this time, she was bothering everyone because she didn't want to be photographed

144
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:40,832
There's Yoko-chan.

145
00:11:42,298 --> 00:11:43,788
I was when she graduated from school

146
00:11:44,152 --> 00:11:46,653
She looked nice too.

147
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:51,556
I thought she would be the happiest.

148
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,980
was our dad smiling like this?

149
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,546
I wonder what New Year's holiday it was

150
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,077
When we first put it out in the store.

151
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,659
It was really flashy.

152
00:12:05,715 --> 00:12:07,300
I can still see it now, sis

153
00:12:09,414 --> 00:12:10,105
Sis.

154
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,010
I didn't imagine that Kyoka moved out of Osaka

155
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:20,002
The rumor of destroying here and
building a new building is really, sister?

156
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,231
It's up to the person who bought it

157
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,476
We could sold this house,

158
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:32,537
We were able to pay off the debts our father had when he was in business,

159
00:12:32,945 --> 00:12:35,111
and we moved back home to Tokyo

160
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,839
That's true, but

161
00:12:38,652 --> 00:12:39,852
You know what.

162
00:12:41,315 --> 00:12:45,237
We must be strangers who have come to adopt.

163
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,946
We went out of business because of it.

164
00:12:51,132 --> 00:12:56,028
I thought that studying to become a banker
was the way to protect the Makioka family

165
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,331
Honestly, I don't think that much

166
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,855
I've heard that before but

167
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:05,936
Then you should be more than happy for us to go to Tokyo.

168
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:12,672
Yuko-chan and Koi thought I ruined this main house.

169
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,436
You think too much.

170
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,243
Sis, what's that? That's Yoko's kimono

171
00:13:22,377 --> 00:13:23,983
What a nice.

172
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,606
My dad did it for me that I just want to be able to get married anytime

173
00:13:30,905 --> 00:13:36,894
He was so unhappy man.
He was nice at first time.

174
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:40,349
Yukiko-chan liked that person too

175
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,117
We promised to go see a movie together and Yoko-chan is waiting for us

176
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:48,236
On the way to the restaurant, his car crashed into track.

177
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,589
Human life is a fleeting thing.

178
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,662
Don't talk about him anymore.

179
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:56,026
But that was already four years ago

180
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,032
I think Yukiko-chan's big emotional wounds are gradually healing

181
00:14:01,706 --> 00:14:02,579
And what more.

182
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:04,159
What?

183
00:14:04,555 --> 00:14:07,555
Actually, Yoko-chan has a marriage proposal right now.

184
00:14:08,523 --> 00:14:09,596
Really?

185
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,455
I'll look into it a bit more and let you know the details

186
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,477
Yuko-chan, let me take care of this.

187
00:14:17,263 --> 00:14:20,263
But I feel sorry for Teinosuke.

188
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:23,226
You don't have to worry about him.

189
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:24,876
Yeah.

190
00:14:25,579 --> 00:14:27,685
but I'll ask to what our family says

191
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:33,530
Dad is back.

192
00:14:33,947 --> 00:14:35,991
This place is very messy.

193
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:38,351
Welcome back.

194
00:14:38,376 --> 00:14:39,410
Oh you are here.

195
00:14:43,294 --> 00:14:45,469
Don't play there.

196
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,759
The date for your trip to Tokyo has been decided?

197
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,143
I was forced something from main office.

198
00:14:53,324 --> 00:14:55,597
I won't be able to visit koi's exhibition.

199
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:56,812
Sorry.

200
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:04,166
Ah, I forgot about the souvenirs. Ah, leave them all here.

201
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:06,470
The souvenirs are coming soon

202
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:10,083
I wonder what's this.

203
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:12,150
Sweets or toys?

204
00:15:12,892 --> 00:15:13,958
Open it.

205
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:16,852
Here it is.

206
00:15:17,797 --> 00:15:18,931
Give it to me

207
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:46,885
Koi?

208
00:15:47,362 --> 00:15:48,890
Oh, Mary.

209
00:15:49,314 --> 00:15:50,557
Congratulations.

210
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,491
Thank you.

211
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:57,252
This woman, Mary, works at an American trading company in Motomachi

212
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:59,063
Her Japanese is very good.

213
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:05,132
Everyone,I become Koi-san's student and become an artist.

214
00:16:05,469 --> 00:16:07,675
Thank you in advance.

215
00:16:07,741 --> 00:16:08,747
She speaks Kansai dialect.

216
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:11,465
The person who taught her Japanese is from Osaka

217
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,248
That's right.

218
00:16:13,532 --> 00:16:16,619
She's Yamamura-style's Osho.

219
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:18,809
The dancer?

220
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Yeah.

221
00:16:21,087 --> 00:16:23,179
I wonder if I want to be your student

222
00:16:23,647 --> 00:16:24,804
Do you mind?

223
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:26,464
OK OK

224
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:29,299
You look fun.

225
00:16:31,061 --> 00:16:32,532
Please excuse me for a moment

226
00:16:33,882 --> 00:16:34,888
Thanks for your hard work.

227
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:36,359
Let's go to Noda,Keibon.

228
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,036
Are you going to make a pamphlet?

229
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:42,000
Yes, I want one in front of the venue too

230
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:45,142
You're working so hard.

231
00:16:45,969 --> 00:16:46,738
Good luck

232
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:49,203
Go get the credit properly.

233
00:16:49,743 --> 00:16:50,858
Let me see.

234
00:16:54,275 --> 00:16:55,911
Is he Okahata's Keibon?

235
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,830
He's a son of a jewelry store owner in Shinsaibashi.

236
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,117
They used to run away together,

237
00:17:01,191 --> 00:17:02,106
Holding their hands?

238
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,825
Of course.

239
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,739
It was widely reported in the newspapers, and both houses were chased

240
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,160
Nakan chan's are coming soon.

241
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:23,454
I see. I have to go home soon

242
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,711
This is a celebrate the exhibition.

243
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,236
Handbag?

244
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,932
Open that handbag

245
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,496
There's a brooch inside

246
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,648
That's so sweet.

247
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:35,304
It costs a lot.

248
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:36,090
I know

249
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,834
Thank you for your hard work.

250
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,405
Nakan-chan, He's Keibon

251
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:54,531
Really?

252
00:17:56,582 --> 00:17:57,564
Welcome.

253
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:59,412
Oh, I saw Jinba-san just now

254
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:01,167
I made a promise here

255
00:18:01,846 --> 00:18:04,079
He's waiting for you at the cafe

256
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,296
I'm going to go for a bit.

257
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,608
Let's play with dolls together.

258
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:17,427
Hello, how is it going for a while?

259
00:18:17,817 --> 00:18:20,805
Have you looked into it yourself since then?

260
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,262
Yes, he us the president of Kansai Electric Railway

261
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,519
He has a good reputation at his workplace

262
00:18:27,644 --> 00:18:29,491
Everything was exactly as you told

263
00:18:29,586 --> 00:18:32,380
Isn't it time to go on a blind date?

264
00:18:32,642 --> 00:18:36,520
I did, but I had to ask permission from my home base

265
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,983
I'm sorry to say this but

266
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:43,559
I feel sorry for Yukiko if the main family is being so strict

267
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,400
That's just as you say

268
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:50,177
Anyway,they are urging you to hurry up

269
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,140
The president of Kansai Electric Railway has been very helpful to us

270
00:18:54,863 --> 00:18:56,129
So please.

271
00:18:57,447 --> 00:18:58,254
I guess that's right

272
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:07,387
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

273
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:10,692
I'll report the statistics on Yukiko though.

274
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,428
The problem with the Koi and Keibon is troubling

275
00:19:14,765 --> 00:19:17,170
Koi-san's work is quite complicated

276
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:20,290
There are things that ordinary people don't understand,

277
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,343
I agree

278
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,386
I was worried so I thought I'd ask her about it

279
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,879
She's at short apartment.

280
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,087
Yeah yeah yeah

281
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:31,610
Well, actually, I didn't tell you this,

282
00:19:31,635 --> 00:19:35,097
but Keibon has been telling me to go
to the office recently about the business

283
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,526
No, he took the items from the store

284
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,908
her mother has to clean up after.

285
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:45,627
I've heard the rumors he gave birth to a child with a girl from a cabaret club.

286
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,120
Does koi know that?

287
00:19:52,711 --> 00:19:53,304
Koi?

288
00:19:54,595 --> 00:19:55,637
Don't come.

289
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,230
I'm on the phone.

290
00:19:57,795 --> 00:19:59,257
I can't wait

291
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:00,560
Wait.

292
00:20:04,913 --> 00:20:06,373
You must be tired today.

293
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:07,976
Not really

294
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:12,991
I promised our students that we'd go out for dinner once we narrowed down the venue

295
00:20:13,251 --> 00:20:14,185
I see.

296
00:20:20,256 --> 00:20:22,129
I mean, I'll just ask you straight out

297
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,028
Koi-san, when did you start dating Keibon again?

298
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:27,551
What's that?

299
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:29,205
Did you see us?

300
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,183
Yes

301
00:20:31,019 --> 00:20:33,279
I want you to explain it to me in a way that I can understand today

302
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:38,957
Both Teinosuke-san and I have responsibilities to the main family

303
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,625
It's our responsibility to give you this job.

304
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,740
I don't think it'll be a big deal

305
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,460
Why?

306
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,754
I wonder if that was last fall

307
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,516
When the first exhibition was held

308
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:53,322
That's right

309
00:20:53,644 --> 00:20:57,991
at that time he came and bought the best work.

310
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:00,893
After that, we started going out together

311
00:21:00,918 --> 00:21:02,226
, but

312
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:05,400
Of course, we only meet occasionally,

313
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:08,425
if we have a strange relationship,

314
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,757
I don't think he'd be in an exhibition.

315
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,300
I'm not a child anymore, unlike before

316
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,515
I want you to trust me on that point,

317
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,610
but if our family finds out, we won't be able to face them.

318
00:21:20,293 --> 00:21:22,777
I am responsible for it.

319
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:23,559
What a fool

320
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,423
What's so stupid about that?

321
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,906
I wonder how much of  shame it would have been

322
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:31,260
when Koi-san and Keibon had just appeared in the newspaper at that time

323
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,415
If those two were to become rumor in the world today,

324
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,009
we'll be in trouble again.

325
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,133
We are genuinely in a relationship.

326
00:21:38,517 --> 00:21:40,451
And main house is in Tokyo.

327
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:42,700
How they notice us?

328
00:21:42,781 --> 00:21:43,447
Koi-san

329
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:47,299
Nakan-chan, don't worry about us.

330
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:56,895
Maybe Yuko-chan will have an arranged marriage meeting

331
00:21:58,126 --> 00:22:00,100
Then it's with Nomura-san?

332
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,799
That's why you have to be also very careful about Keibon.

333
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:08,035
I know, I won't do anything to make you worry,

334
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:09,415
Are you sure?

335
00:22:11,576 --> 00:22:12,529
I'll go home.

336
00:22:50,824 --> 00:22:53,651
You're stupid.
What if she found you?

337
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:58,047
She couldn't go home easily, so I squatted down against the window and cried.

338
00:22:58,487 --> 00:22:59,541
You are stupid.

339
00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:03,083
Yukiko will have a blind date?

340
00:23:03,616 --> 00:23:04,754
Yep, it seems so.

341
00:23:05,034 --> 00:23:05,861
With whom?

342
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,510
He's rich and elegant.

343
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,853
I see.
He's like me

344
00:23:10,878 --> 00:23:13,878
I can't compare it to you.
You are stupid.

345
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,206
Am I so bad?

346
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:17,518
Yeah.

347
00:23:21,315 --> 00:23:23,190
You're saying what you want to say

348
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:32,689
But I'm really glad that you're willing to go on a blind date

349
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,565
What?

350
00:23:35,556 --> 00:23:38,994
I can't marry someone unless you marry someone.

351
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,046
Of course

352
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:43,885
The main house is old, but even now they still keep the order

353
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,432
Are you starting another job?

354
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,994
I want to do that

355
00:23:53,222 --> 00:23:54,448
I am against it

356
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,580
Why?

357
00:23:55,815 --> 00:23:57,542
I  can't make a living by making dolls.

358
00:23:58,518 --> 00:24:01,229
Why are you against me having a job?

359
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,018
You can't get a share of your property

360
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,221
Wives shouldn't work.

361
00:24:10,573 --> 00:24:11,847
You’re sweet.

362
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:16,268
No matter how much money you have, you spend it

363
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,896
Oh gosh.

364
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,656
You're currently enjoying the luxury of your mother's savings,

365
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:26,010
but what will you do if something happens to her?

366
00:24:27,548 --> 00:24:30,979
That's true, my brother is not on my side,

367
00:24:31,143 --> 00:24:31,761
See?

368
00:24:32,497 --> 00:24:34,869
so you're just going to keep quiet and watch what I do

369
00:24:34,894 --> 00:24:35,940
I get it.

370
00:24:44,893 --> 00:24:47,089
Please look happier.

371
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:48,526
Sorry,

372
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:55,151
I think that if it was Nomura-san, he'd do
whatever you said and do what you wanted

373
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,502
Please feel free to go.

374
00:25:01,253 --> 00:25:02,472
Put more lip stick.

375
00:25:02,986 --> 00:25:03,904
Why?

376
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,823
It's better.

377
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
You think so?

378
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:17,706
Thank you for coming.

379
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:19,401
Welcome.

380
00:25:19,534 --> 00:25:22,261
hello.
What's that?

381
00:25:23,175 --> 00:25:24,675
This is where I finish it off

382
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:25,472
Here?

383
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:26,479
Studio

384
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,448
Can I enter?

385
00:25:27,473 --> 00:25:28,409
Please come in.

386
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:36,869
This is not an American style photo studio at all.

387
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,112
You think so?

388
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,338
The sign in front of this house is very old.

389
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,932
Keibon helped me.

390
00:25:44,386 --> 00:25:48,526
You were well looked after by him.

391
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:52,405
But you shouldn't follow him completely.

392
00:25:54,901 --> 00:25:57,787
but he's a great help to me

393
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,213
Oh? I know

394
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,424
How long have you been to America?

395
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:05,908
for six years

396
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,425
Whereabouts you were?

397
00:26:07,911 --> 00:26:09,924
I studied photography in Los Angeles

398
00:26:12,647 --> 00:26:15,962
You didn't even graduate from middle school.
Is that right?

399
00:26:16,245 --> 00:26:18,987
Yeah.
My family was really poor

400
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,080
You must have been hard.

401
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:30,448
I made money in America by washing dishes and working as a hotel bellboy.

402
00:26:31,699 --> 00:26:33,736
Did you do it on your own?

403
00:26:33,776 --> 00:26:37,659
I rely only on my own strength

404
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:45,910
I see, This is strong arm.

405
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,120
if you touched my arm,

406
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,604
I'd feel like I was being shocked by electricity

407
00:26:51,339 --> 00:26:52,432
Don't say bullshit.

408
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:55,596
the tea is ready

409
00:26:55,621 --> 00:26:56,839
Thank you very much.

410
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:03,213
I came to ask you a favor

411
00:27:03,893 --> 00:27:04,690
What?

412
00:27:05,748 --> 00:27:08,909
I would like a copy of the photo from the doll exhibition the other day.

413
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:12,242
That's my job so it's no problem.

414
00:27:14,761 --> 00:27:16,800
Were you at work?

415
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:18,455
Yes I was.

416
00:27:21,026 --> 00:27:22,370
It's a Rokko hotel.

417
00:27:22,768 --> 00:27:23,472
Yes.

418
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,776
She is currently having a matchmaking session at this hotel.

419
00:28:00,737 --> 00:28:03,643
Sorry...Nomura..

420
00:28:06,338 --> 00:28:08,604
what is your main job?

421
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:17,836
I work in the inheritance department.

422
00:28:18,274 --> 00:28:21,274
That is a very interesting job

423
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:25,173
Well, half of what he does is just a hobby

424
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:29,259
The president of Kansai Electric Railway Company is providing for his livelihood.

425
00:28:29,284 --> 00:28:30,486
I get it.

426
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:37,126
Of course, everyone at Kyoka's place

427
00:28:38,103 --> 00:28:40,525
You guys listen to Western music, right?

428
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,314
Yes, this person plays the piano.

429
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:46,110
I have recently started playing the koto again

430
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:50,907
That's because my youngest sister is a dancer in the Yamamura.

431
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,430
so I have many opportunities to become familiar with the koto.

432
00:28:54,455 --> 00:28:56,211
Oh Yamamura's?

433
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,259
She dances well

434
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,868
She occasionally holds recitals.

435
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:06,376
I can’t believe it.

436
00:29:06,836 --> 00:29:08,015
It's strange that that's not the case

437
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,876
No, but that's not common sense

438
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:11,571
That's a problem

439
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,571
Who would say something like that?

440
00:29:15,517 --> 00:29:17,259
I hadn't thought of that

441
00:29:18,766 --> 00:29:20,659
Hello, are you Nomura-san?

442
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:23,975
not? No, I wasn't expecting it.

443
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,181
I’m sorry.

444
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:35,934
I started talking to myself again.

445
00:29:43,536 --> 00:29:44,723
Hi.

446
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,090
What?

447
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,871
please go home

448
00:30:00,534 --> 00:30:02,581
Forgive me....

449
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:06,723
The most important thing is hidden for him.

450
00:30:07,247 --> 00:30:08,895
He has such a silly habit.

451
00:30:09,786 --> 00:30:11,614
It's kind of charming

452
00:30:15,777 --> 00:30:18,535
You met your husband today?

453
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:19,731
Who told you?

454
00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:22,915
Oharu told me.

455
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,936
If I get married,

456
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,449
Etsuko will be in trouble

457
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:26,379
Why?

458
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,598
Who check my homework?

459
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:32,215
No way! I'm in trouble.

460
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:33,051
I don't get married.

461
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,786
I'm glad.

462
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,458
Ask Oharu put your kimono in the right place

463
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:38,598
Yes, yeah

464
00:30:38,623 --> 00:30:40,676
I'll take care of it later.

465
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:50,036
I'm sad.

466
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,145
Why?

467
00:30:52,554 --> 00:30:54,765
There are better matchmaking stories out there.

468
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,527
I mean...

469
00:30:57,554 --> 00:31:01,792
Once I've finished this today, I have to go to Tokyo

470
00:31:02,176 --> 00:31:04,707
You should have just taken it a little slower

471
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:07,160
I will send them a letter.

472
00:31:07,472 --> 00:31:09,714
Really?
I'm glad.

473
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,355
I feel better now

474
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:20,449
Do it in the garden

475
00:31:20,474 --> 00:31:22,770
Let's practice the piano

476
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:31,129
You shouldn't say unnecessary things to children.

477
00:31:31,176 --> 00:31:32,122
Sorry.

478
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,090
Do you have anything to drink?

479
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:36,637
No

480
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:39,790
Please go to the greengrocer and buy it.

481
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,780
Yukiko, it seems like things didn't go well.

482
00:31:52,113 --> 00:31:53,902
Oharu told you that?

483
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,098
Etsuko said that

484
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:57,066
everyone's so talkative

485
00:31:57,386 --> 00:32:00,386
If it's that person, it doesn't matter.

486
00:32:01,293 --> 00:32:02,473
hurry up

487
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:10,441
Also, Yukiko couldn't forget the first person

488
00:32:11,238 --> 00:32:12,856
Yes, that's true, but...

489
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,880
she'd better forget about it quickly.

490
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:18,576
Anyway, I hope she can be happy for at least one day

491
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,600
You really care about her.

492
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:24,208
Of course.

493
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:28,335
She should find a good husband.

494
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:31,191
It's important to have a happy home.

495
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:32,934
You want fires?

496
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:34,739
There.

497
00:32:36,295 --> 00:32:38,684
I want to eat oranges

498
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:40,439
You haven't finished studying yet.

499
00:32:41,214 --> 00:32:44,066
My sister asked me to bring it.

500
00:32:44,512 --> 00:32:46,239
I didn't say that.

501
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,957
You said it

502
00:32:47,982 --> 00:32:49,668
It can't be helped.

503
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:59,355
She looks fine so you needn't worry.

504
00:33:13,434 --> 00:33:16,380
It seems that a typhoon has landed

505
00:33:16,982 --> 00:33:20,113
It seems the TV is broken.

506
00:33:21,301 --> 00:33:24,114
I am worried about the typhoon.

507
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:47,348
Hello? Hello?

508
00:33:48,239 --> 00:33:49,801
The phone is not working.

509
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:57,161
Watch out.

510
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:03,372
Watch out.

511
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,637
Watch out.

512
00:34:17,208 --> 00:34:18,442
Oh you

513
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,869
What's wrong?

514
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,036
Where's Koi?

515
00:34:21,061 --> 00:34:23,129
She goes to school

516
00:34:23,697 --> 00:34:25,777
The weather is very bad.

517
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:34,676
Window.

518
00:34:41,768 --> 00:34:43,104
Take this.

519
00:34:49,192 --> 00:34:50,551
I worry about Koi

520
00:34:52,133 --> 00:34:53,949
Is she ok?

521
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:56,317
You should go home early.

522
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:58,637
so be careful.

523
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:30,985
I'll go and pick her up

524
00:35:31,642 --> 00:35:33,652
There's no point in you going.

525
00:35:44,926 --> 00:35:45,934
Koi!

526
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:52,864
Koi!

527
00:35:53,098 --> 00:35:54,153
Itakura!

528
00:36:02,614 --> 00:36:03,567
Koi!

529
00:36:35,747 --> 00:36:37,247
I'm home.

530
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:40,739
Koi!

531
00:36:41,176 --> 00:36:42,778
I'm home.

532
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:45,700
What's wrong?

533
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:47,528
Itakura rescued her

534
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:48,637
Itakura rescued her?

535
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,620
There was a landslide

536
00:36:50,645 --> 00:36:52,262
I see.
Where's Itakura?

537
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:55,600
So Mr. Itakura handed her to me and then went home,

538
00:36:56,138 --> 00:36:58,567
Are you alright?

539
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,020
In the blink of an eye, the ceiling was crushed

540
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:09,910
The principal and I were hiding between the pillars.

541
00:37:10,988 --> 00:37:14,262
but I couldn't breathe and the water was rising

542
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,817
But why Itakura was there?

543
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,059
Itakura risk his life to save me.

544
00:37:21,254 --> 00:37:22,286
What did you do with that dress?

545
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:26,025
I stopped by his house and borrowed this kimono from his sister

546
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,426
That's right, but I'm glad you were helped.

547
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,371
I can't believe I'm alive

548
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:34,934
It's like a dream

549
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,652
It's good.

550
00:39:03,247 --> 00:39:05,668
Why did you hold my hand?

551
00:39:07,348 --> 00:39:07,965
Well..

552
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:10,184
Do you love me?

553
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:11,629
Yes.

554
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:15,503
Why you didn't propose marriage?

555
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:19,995
You have Keibon.

556
00:39:20,371 --> 00:39:24,543
Why do you care about him?

557
00:39:25,604 --> 00:39:28,604
I won't be able to go to your house

558
00:39:29,259 --> 00:39:31,375
Ko-san will be abandoned by your family

559
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,652
So how is that possible?

560
00:39:33,457 --> 00:39:36,457
I think people around the public will say bad things about us.

561
00:39:36,864 --> 00:39:38,395
Are you scared of it?

562
00:39:39,238 --> 00:39:41,566
It can't be helped.

563
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,543
I am waiting for you

564
00:39:51,247 --> 00:39:52,168
Hug me.

565
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:00,020
Hug me.

566
00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:38,609
You look surprised.

567
00:40:38,786 --> 00:40:39,598
Not really.

568
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,277
Is it inconvenient for you to meet me?

569
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:46,411
Not really.

570
00:40:46,436 --> 00:40:47,254
You are lying.

571
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:48,918
Your face show it.

572
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:55,246
I wanna talk with you.

573
00:41:12,592 --> 00:41:14,863
Do you see Koi these days?

574
00:41:15,004 --> 00:41:16,942
I have nothing to do with her.

575
00:41:38,052 --> 00:41:40,055
You were shocked when you saw my face just now

576
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,363
What's wrong?

577
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,176
What were you doing with koi?

578
00:41:47,272 --> 00:41:49,738
I was asked to take some
pictures of dolls.

579
00:41:50,676 --> 00:41:54,457
You're stupid.
She recently stopped making dolls.

580
00:41:56,450 --> 00:41:57,777
You are lying.

581
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:05,637
Don't see her anymore.

582
00:42:08,043 --> 00:42:08,833
Why?

583
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:12,582
Why don't you ask your heart?

584
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,473
Get lost.

585
00:42:30,833 --> 00:42:31,700
Who?

586
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:38,668
Oh Keibon.

587
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,699
We didn't promise

588
00:42:48,812 --> 00:42:50,301
Where did you take this?

589
00:42:51,598 --> 00:42:52,278
Why?

590
00:42:53,278 --> 00:42:54,325
Who took this?

591
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,629
It's none of your business.

592
00:42:56,980 --> 00:42:59,980
I knew Itakura took it.

593
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,160
So what?

594
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:08,184
What have you been doing with him lately?

595
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:09,848
What?

596
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:17,910
He has been with many women and borrowed money from them.

597
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:25,059
Your life will end if you get involved with him.

598
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:27,684
What are you talking about?

599
00:43:28,914 --> 00:43:31,120
I am having someone research him.

600
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,236
During that typhoon

601
00:43:33,283 --> 00:43:37,246
He risked his life to save Koi-san. I just thought that was not a normal thing

602
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Honestly, what have you done to me?

603
00:43:41,856 --> 00:43:42,817
What?

604
00:43:46,887 --> 00:43:48,504
Go home.

605
00:43:53,129 --> 00:43:54,270
Go home.

606
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:58,441
I hate seeing your face

607
00:44:02,028 --> 00:44:06,230
stop going out with him.

608
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:07,965
Please.

609
00:44:08,738 --> 00:44:11,168
He saved my life.

610
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:13,161
Go home.

611
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:16,259
I apologize if what I said was clear

612
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,668
I can't live without you.

613
00:44:24,879 --> 00:44:26,387
Please.

614
00:44:28,712 --> 00:44:30,058
I'm sure you understand this

615
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,098
You can cry

616
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:36,543
I feel like crying,

617
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:42,825
Keibon

618
00:44:45,745 --> 00:44:50,090
I don't know what Itakura think

619
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,527
But as I can see, He just came back from America and it's really interesting.

620
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,935
It's very convenient because he takes care of everything

621
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,637
why don't I use him?

622
00:44:58,887 --> 00:45:03,394
He is happy to do so.

623
00:45:04,124 --> 00:45:07,145
I see.

624
00:45:07,676 --> 00:45:09,050
You are thinking well.

625
00:45:09,246 --> 00:45:12,246
Are you feeling jealous or something?

626
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:14,559
Well then, give this to you.

627
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:18,231
This is awesome.

628
00:45:26,636 --> 00:45:31,887
The lens was broken, it was my brother's favorite camera

629
00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:36,470
It can't be helped.

630
00:45:37,981 --> 00:45:39,122
Customer?

631
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:46,768
Koi.

632
00:45:46,993 --> 00:45:52,623
I'm back, but I've decided to do dressmaker's store as you told me.

633
00:45:53,004 --> 00:45:53,795
I see.

634
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:58,082
I do not want to be a financial burden to you.

635
00:45:58,527 --> 00:46:02,715
Would you like to use your wedding deposit, which your family of origin has entrusted to you?

636
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:07,788
I intend to use the money to negotiate with them.

637
00:46:07,906 --> 00:46:10,906
I wrote a letter to Keanchan in Tokyo

638
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,636
I don't like the brother of the main family

639
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,852
I asked her in Tokyo for a favor.

640
00:46:16,493 --> 00:46:17,226
Is that so?

641
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,117
No, what happened?

642
00:46:23,266 --> 00:46:24,359
I did break.

643
00:46:27,944 --> 00:46:28,691
Koi.

644
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:30,050
What?

645
00:46:30,626 --> 00:46:31,416
What's wrong?

646
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,830
That finger was in my mom's shop.

647
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:39,012
I know it was from Keibon.

648
00:46:40,274 --> 00:46:40,900
Yes.

649
00:46:42,626 --> 00:46:45,759
You are not clear on your relationship with him.

650
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:48,673
I guess you are still loving him.

651
00:46:49,975 --> 00:46:51,109
Itakura.

652
00:46:54,858 --> 00:47:00,226
I can't stand your relationship with KEIBON.

653
00:47:01,058 --> 00:47:06,289
I thought that if Koike-san wanted to be happy, I would work hard.

654
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:09,468
Itakura.

655
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:12,243
Forgive me....

656
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:18,272
I wanna be happy with you.

657
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:24,087
No need for these luxuries.

658
00:47:26,336 --> 00:47:27,889
No need for these luxuries.

659
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,873
Koi.

660
00:47:41,109 --> 00:47:44,109
Is it too late for the autumn leaves to change color?

661
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:49,852
I remember walking to the waterfall every year under the beautiful autumn leaves

662
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,559
Everyone here is doing well,

663
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:57,110
but our life is not so easy

664
00:47:57,770 --> 00:47:59,615
because we depend on my brother's monthly salary

665
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,657
I have talked to my sister many times about how I want to find a job

666
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:13,631
Not only will they not take it up,

667
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,960
I want you to get married quickly and be happy

668
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:20,375
I feel sorry for my dad and my brother scolded me

669
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:23,057
Did you read this too?

670
00:48:24,056 --> 00:48:28,107
She only writes about herself and doesn't write about the important things

671
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:30,277
The important thing is
It's about money?

672
00:48:30,302 --> 00:48:33,808
Yes.I asked her to negotiate with the main house

673
00:48:34,306 --> 00:48:37,306
She didn't, I didn't think she was that kind of person

674
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:38,399
But..

675
00:48:38,506 --> 00:48:39,352
No.

676
00:48:39,863 --> 00:48:42,380
I'm going to Tokyo

677
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,166
I'm going to go there tonight because of that money.

678
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,270
Koi.

679
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:53,577
Sis.

680
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:57,050
Well then, I can just reply to Koisan exactly like that

681
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,660
I showed my husband the letter and asked him twice,

682
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:02,706
but he replied same.

683
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,836
There is no money in Koisan's name

684
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:06,546
I see.

685
00:49:07,540 --> 00:49:10,932
Well, I'm thinking about when she'll get married,

686
00:49:11,806 --> 00:49:13,528
for any reason

687
00:49:13,553 --> 00:49:15,594
There is no money in Koisan's name

688
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:18,087
I get it.

689
00:49:20,193 --> 00:49:23,193
but my family is against she open dressmaker.

690
00:49:24,226 --> 00:49:27,453
They want her to study dolls and dance.

691
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:33,407
But does your brother have the right to restrict her freedom?

692
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:36,004
I guess there's no.

693
00:49:36,706 --> 00:49:38,334
where is she waiting?

694
00:49:38,399 --> 00:49:39,212
In Gaien.

695
00:49:39,941 --> 00:49:41,821
She came all the way to Tokyo.
Why she's there?

696
00:49:41,934 --> 00:49:43,348
I asked her to do that.

697
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:46,046
If she come directly here

698
00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:49,042
She meet her brother again, something terrible will happen

699
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:51,388
Mom.

700
00:49:51,413 --> 00:49:52,681
Hold on.

701
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,188
Be quiet.

702
00:50:02,446 --> 00:50:05,611
Yuko-chan, please bring Koi-san after you settled down.

703
00:50:05,966 --> 00:50:07,603
I want to see her.

704
00:50:08,098 --> 00:50:09,611
I'll tell her so

705
00:50:09,636 --> 00:50:10,793
I'm waiting

706
00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:11,571
Please

707
00:50:41,744 --> 00:50:44,617
You have any money in my name?

708
00:50:44,790 --> 00:50:48,969
That's right. I was thinking of asking my brother

709
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:51,937
but my sister told me to stop doing that

710
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:53,804
The truth is,your life is getting tough

711
00:50:53,829 --> 00:50:56,829
So why would you lie and try to cover it up like that?

712
00:50:57,533 --> 00:50:58,533
I don't think so.

713
00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:04,556
I really need that money to open a dressmaker.

714
00:51:05,097 --> 00:51:07,904
What are you doing all of a sudden?

715
00:51:12,106 --> 00:51:14,926
I promised to marry Itakura.

716
00:51:15,101 --> 00:51:16,235
With Itakura?

717
00:51:17,815 --> 00:51:19,518
so do you think I am weird?

718
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,353
I don't think that's the case

719
00:51:23,062 --> 00:51:27,970
He helped my life.

720
00:51:28,477 --> 00:51:30,053
But.

721
00:51:30,404 --> 00:51:33,764
He's pure man.

722
00:51:34,752 --> 00:51:37,390
But he has a strong body.

723
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:40,890
He has the courage to jump into the fire when the time comes

724
00:51:41,790 --> 00:51:45,385
He has the passion.

725
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:49,214
But what about Keibon?

726
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,630
You know what?

727
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:57,485
I realized that education has no worth.

728
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:02,293
Someone who enjoys the luxury of tasting their mother.

729
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,901
People who have the ability to struggle and survive on their own are much better

730
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:09,606
I think it's right.

731
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:15,681
But I wonder if it will affect your marriage if I get married him?

732
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:21,681
Why should my fate be affected by something like that?

733
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:28,264
I'm sure that happiness will come to me soon

734
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:29,767
Yeah.

735
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:34,999
This is the first time I've said this to you.

736
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:37,505
Thank you very much.

737
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:42,999
Are you confident that you'll be happy if you marry Itakura-san?

738
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:48,116
Well then, please talk to your brother right away

739
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,314
I'll support you too

740
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:51,258
Go to a nearby place from here

741
00:53:00,672 --> 00:53:04,711
She probably eat her meals outside, right?

742
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:05,672
Koi?

743
00:53:06,013 --> 00:53:06,587
Yes.

744
00:53:07,115 --> 00:53:08,028
Yeah.

745
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:10,202
it can't be helped if she didn't.

746
00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:14,369
I want her to sleep in the same futon with you.

747
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,931
Thank for coming.

748
00:53:21,002 --> 00:53:22,709
How are you doing?

749
00:53:23,782 --> 00:53:26,779
The telegram came soon after Yuko left.

750
00:53:26,898 --> 00:53:28,586
from Osaka?

751
00:53:32,801 --> 00:53:35,101
Itakura-san is in critical condition.

752
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,864
Itakura-san's sis told her.

753
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:39,767
What happened?

754
00:53:40,059 --> 00:53:41,625
Calm down.

755
00:53:42,226 --> 00:53:45,226
I have to go back in Osaka.

756
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:46,753
Koi.

757
00:53:52,805 --> 00:53:53,505
Hold on.

758
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,390
What happened to him?

759
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:03,903
He said his ears hurt.

760
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,650
Please tell main house about Itakura.

761
00:54:09,175 --> 00:54:09,815
Koi.

762
00:54:10,570 --> 00:54:14,230
If so, you will surely be happy

763
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,210
I'll ask my brother about the money again.

764
00:54:18,346 --> 00:54:20,889
I'll tell you later.

765
00:54:20,914 --> 00:54:22,630
Thank you very much.

766
00:54:44,429 --> 00:54:45,109
Over there.

767
00:54:54,444 --> 00:54:56,217
I'm Makioka.

768
00:54:56,545 --> 00:54:59,545
Itakura-san's parents has arrived.

769
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:02,233
I see. So how is the patient?

770
00:55:02,704 --> 00:55:03,917
acute otitis media

771
00:55:04,220 --> 00:55:07,965
He got a fungus in his leg during surgery.

772
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,221
It's serious now.

773
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,170
No, why did it happened...

774
00:55:17,795 --> 00:55:19,045
Thanks for coming.

775
00:55:21,256 --> 00:55:24,276
Are you alright?

776
00:55:29,792 --> 00:55:31,194
it hurts!

777
00:55:46,526 --> 00:55:47,493
It hurts.

778
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,879
It hurts.

779
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:05,392
Koi.

780
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,550
The director of this clinic is telling me to
operate on the painful part of his leg again

781
00:56:12,190 --> 00:56:13,296
Can you perform the surgery?

782
00:56:13,323 --> 00:56:13,803
Yes.

783
00:56:15,257 --> 00:56:18,371
But his parents are from the countryside, they know nothing.

784
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:21,252
They said he was killed.

785
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,648
It's better to have surgery,

786
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:28,313
please tell them.

787
00:56:28,846 --> 00:56:32,562
They will also listen to what important people have to say

788
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:33,755
Am I like that?

789
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:38,224
I'll try my best to tell them.

790
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:42,189
I'll try to tell them while I can.

791
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,740
I guess he's in the middle of surgency right now

792
00:57:36,205 --> 00:57:37,112
Yes.

793
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,575
I was choked up by the phone call from Koi-san

794
00:57:41,818 --> 00:57:46,017
That's what I thought, so what kind of disease is this?

795
00:57:46,767 --> 00:57:50,483
I don't know the details, but it's not like something harmful

796
00:57:50,650 --> 00:57:53,566
If so,He needs to have one leg amputated.

797
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,933
He needs to have one leg amputated?

798
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,660
What are you going to do if he'd saved?

799
00:58:09,313 --> 00:58:11,419
Just thinking about it makes my head hurt.

800
00:58:14,808 --> 00:58:15,837
Sachiko

801
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,423
Actually, deep down

802
00:58:22,390 --> 00:58:24,471
you wish Ita would die, right?

803
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:29,760
Ah, that's right

804
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:35,474
Humans are despicable.

805
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,107
Yoneyan.

806
00:58:55,037 --> 00:58:55,783
Koi-san.

807
00:58:56,923 --> 00:58:57,825
Are you alright?

808
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:01,273
It feels like a dream.

809
00:59:02,070 --> 00:59:03,965
It does not hurts.

810
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,747
What happened with My leg?

811
00:59:08,785 --> 00:59:10,078
I'm glad.

812
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,476
Where did everyone go?

813
00:59:14,670 --> 00:59:17,670
There are resting over there.

814
00:59:18,343 --> 00:59:19,305
I see.

815
00:59:21,482 --> 00:59:24,455
I'm sorry for worrying you so much

816
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:26,609
What are you talking about?

817
00:59:27,833 --> 00:59:29,839
I'll work as soon as I get out of the hospital

818
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:32,432
I'll do it too.

819
00:59:34,843 --> 00:59:35,630
Koi-san.

820
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,062
No matter how poor or hardship I'm in,

821
00:59:41,023 --> 00:59:43,303
I have the courage to fight it,

822
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,608
but it's hard to make Koi-san endure that

823
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:50,058
That alone is the most painful thing

824
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:54,515
I am planning to be reborn for you.

825
00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:56,143
I tried my best.

826
00:59:57,110 --> 00:59:57,897
Koi-san.

827
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:00,760
Thank you very much.

828
01:00:02,882 --> 01:00:04,048
I'm glad.

829
01:00:06,263 --> 01:00:11,274
If anything happened to you, I was going to die.

830
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:13,560
I'm relieved.

831
01:00:34,546 --> 01:00:37,024
I know it was hard for you.

832
01:00:37,569 --> 01:00:40,813
I for one am glad to get out of the main house.

833
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:42,131
I see.

834
01:00:42,695 --> 01:00:45,695
But what they say?
About Koi's money.

835
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:49,484
They said they didn't have that kind of money after all

836
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,303
I just got a call from Koi-san.

837
01:00:53,856 --> 01:00:54,610
From Koi?

838
01:00:54,967 --> 01:00:56,909
Itakura-san has just passed away.

839
01:00:57,707 --> 01:00:58,647
Itakura-san has just passed away?

840
01:01:38,612 --> 01:01:39,105
Koi-san.

841
01:01:44,636 --> 01:01:46,467
What did you come here for?

842
01:01:46,934 --> 01:01:47,928
What do you mean?

843
01:01:49,411 --> 01:01:54,464
I was working with him for long.
I'm also a Blood type A-type

844
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:58,082
I thought that maybe blood transfusions would be useful

845
01:01:59,637 --> 01:02:00,957
But it was too late.

846
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:03,406
I thought you'd be happy.

847
01:02:03,431 --> 01:02:04,241
Why me?

848
01:02:06,409 --> 01:02:07,236
I'm not like that.

849
01:02:14,146 --> 01:02:15,419
Itakura ended up like this

850
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:19,281
Don't die without telling me.

851
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:23,890
You are stupid.

852
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:43,910
What a big rock.

853
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,510
This is awesome.

854
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,640
My parents are being taken by Koi-san to see the sights of Osaka

855
01:02:59,082 --> 01:03:01,839
So I thought I'd take this opportunity to let you know

856
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:05,798
Please come in.

857
01:03:07,887 --> 01:03:10,081
Is it important?

858
01:03:12,020 --> 01:03:15,115
Actually, before that brother died...

859
01:03:15,276 --> 01:03:16,209
Mr. Itakura?

860
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:16,982
Yes

861
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:21,118
At that time, Koi-san wasn't there

862
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:27,543
but my brother said that Yukiko would bring the money from Tokyo soon

863
01:03:28,142 --> 01:03:29,169
Me?

864
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:30,379
Yes.

865
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:33,010
Taking the money from the main family.

866
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:37,698
My brother said happily that it must be a lot of money.

867
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,390
No, not at all

868
01:03:40,720 --> 01:03:45,036
My brother was trying to somehow get money out of Koi-san,

869
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:47,668
and that's what he did

870
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,016
Well then, Mr. Itakura cheated Koi-san.

871
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:54,831
I don't want to say this coming from his sister

872
01:03:55,643 --> 01:04:02,851
It's so painful to see that Koi-san has
been kind to us since my brother died.

873
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,576
But my brother is already dead

874
01:04:08,660 --> 01:04:10,736
Please forgive him.

875
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,266
Oh you have a visitor.

876
01:04:14,600 --> 01:04:16,120
The customer is Itakura-san's sister.

877
01:04:29,639 --> 01:04:30,688
Can you see it?

878
01:04:30,881 --> 01:04:31,881
Yes.

879
01:04:33,252 --> 01:04:35,178
Wanna see?

880
01:04:37,755 --> 01:04:39,121
Thank you.

881
01:04:39,147 --> 01:04:40,694
Be careful

882
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:54,763
so Itakura was such a bad guy?

883
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:57,953
Koi was deceived.

884
01:04:58,218 --> 01:05:00,398
I don't want to feel like that.

885
01:05:00,566 --> 01:05:02,656
but he was after money

886
01:05:03,582 --> 01:05:08,554
Koi-san was so serious, I want to believe in Koi-san.

887
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:11,985
but Itakura wanted the money

888
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:15,010
I think the only person who can provide that money must have been Koisan

889
01:05:15,626 --> 01:05:16,239
Why?

890
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:19,542
Itakura must have loved Koi-san.

891
01:05:20,991 --> 01:05:21,778
You think so?

892
01:05:22,071 --> 01:05:25,032
That's right, that's what I thought.

893
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:28,298
I guess I'll just have to keep this story to koi-san.

894
01:05:28,385 --> 01:05:29,092
Yeah.

895
01:05:29,641 --> 01:05:31,468
She might get upset.

896
01:05:34,417 --> 01:05:37,444
What does brother say?

897
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:40,986
He talked about my blind date again?

898
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:41,696
That's right.

899
01:05:44,609 --> 01:05:46,835
He's trying his best to make up for it.

900
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,070
That's a pretty good.

901
01:06:06,033 --> 01:06:07,506
Here's very good.

902
01:06:09,060 --> 01:06:11,230
Is this your first time here?

903
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:14,067
I don't have any business in places like this,

904
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:21,240
but these days, every company seems to be using these places for some reason

905
01:06:21,617 --> 01:06:23,788
I'm not very good at that kind of meeting,

906
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:27,207
but does your company have something going on?

907
01:06:27,466 --> 01:06:30,466
I don't come to the place like here.

908
01:06:33,525 --> 01:06:34,945
Today is special day for me.

909
01:06:46,759 --> 01:06:47,939
Your meal is ready.

910
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:50,377
Let's start

911
01:06:50,530 --> 01:06:51,449
Let's go.

912
01:07:07,428 --> 01:07:09,101
Fukusaburo Hashidera

913
01:07:10,356 --> 01:07:14,103
His biography. Doctor of Medicine

914
01:07:14,983 --> 01:07:17,983
Executive Director, TOWA Pharmaceuticals

915
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:22,062
What do you think about him?

916
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:25,459
I don't understand him even if I've seen him once or twice

917
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:28,700
Yukiko never says anything, but

918
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,370
she always says that she decides for herself whether something is good or bad

919
01:07:32,514 --> 01:07:33,114
Who?

920
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:34,332
Ennosuke brother.

921
01:07:34,949 --> 01:07:36,009
I see.

922
01:07:37,897 --> 01:07:39,114
He's a bit eccentric

923
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:42,671
But I think he's the best candidate so far

924
01:07:43,156 --> 01:07:44,188
That's true

925
01:07:44,786 --> 01:07:46,943
He does look similar to him

926
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:49,621
Your first man.

927
01:07:50,409 --> 01:07:52,213
Help my homework.

928
01:07:52,238 --> 01:07:53,288
Where?

929
01:07:55,165 --> 01:07:57,707
Don't you understand this?

930
01:07:57,747 --> 01:07:59,314
Just think for yourself

931
01:07:59,959 --> 01:08:01,439
I have no idea.

932
01:08:01,589 --> 01:08:03,246
I'll check it later.

933
01:08:06,607 --> 01:08:07,846
Nakan-chan

934
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:12,041
It seems Koi-san go back home late since I've came here.

935
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,146
It was before that

936
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,520
And She become messy.

937
01:08:22,715 --> 01:08:23,775
Be careful.

938
01:08:26,492 --> 01:08:27,849
No, Keibon.

939
01:08:35,724 --> 01:08:36,724
Do you feel pain?

940
01:08:37,668 --> 01:08:38,761
did you drink too much?

941
01:08:41,123 --> 01:08:43,289
Did you make me drink too much?

942
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:44,976
Yes, have some water.

943
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:50,203
Go home,Keibon.

944
01:08:50,349 --> 01:08:51,076
Why

945
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:52,860
You're mean.

946
01:08:56,211 --> 01:08:58,365
there are good things about you.

947
01:08:59,770 --> 01:09:04,350
Thank you for being so kind to me at Itakura's funeral.

948
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:10,693
please stop talking about him.

949
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:14,738
You were burned to death.

950
01:09:15,551 --> 01:09:16,425
Why?

951
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,880
My brother disinheritanceed with me

952
01:09:26,765 --> 01:09:27,518
Your brother disinheritanceed with you.

953
01:09:28,513 --> 01:09:32,244
it's been 35 days since my mother died

954
01:09:33,989 --> 01:09:36,184
I got fired from the store.

955
01:09:37,365 --> 01:09:38,125
I see.

956
01:09:39,846 --> 01:09:41,059
You're miserable too.

957
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,466
What on earth are you planning to do from now on?

958
01:09:50,382 --> 01:09:52,902
Hello,This is Kakioka.

959
01:09:53,091 --> 01:09:54,277
I did it

960
01:09:55,880 --> 01:09:58,666
Don't read at that again

961
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,847
Look at this.

962
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,780
This is the reason why we ended up like this

963
01:10:04,897 --> 01:10:06,710
Hashidera is calling you.

964
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,834
Hashidewa?
Where's the wife?

965
01:10:09,865 --> 01:10:11,395
She came all the way to the post office

966
01:10:12,076 --> 01:10:14,975
No, she's not home

967
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:17,214
Hashidera-san wants to talk with you.

968
01:10:17,499 --> 01:10:18,733
Me?

969
01:10:26,983 --> 01:10:31,147
Sorry to have kept you waiting

970
01:10:34,088 --> 01:10:37,088
I apologize for being rude someday

971
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:48,436
Thank you very much for taking me up on your offer

972
01:10:49,608 --> 01:10:50,335
Who?

973
01:10:51,763 --> 01:10:53,280
Hashidera-san

974
01:10:53,514 --> 01:10:54,420
What did he say?

975
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:58,070
He said Hanging out in Shinsaibashi tomorrow evening

976
01:10:58,297 --> 01:11:00,603
and have dinner together.

977
01:11:00,639 --> 01:11:01,975
Isn't that great?

978
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,124
I wanna go.

979
01:11:03,154 --> 01:11:04,436
There's nowhere for my kids to go

980
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,920
That's the same restaurant as that time

981
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,486
When I heard that

982
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:18,510
I was scared that the same thing would happen again,

983
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:19,959
You are stupid.

984
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:23,316
He knows nothing about you from way back when

985
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:25,444
But

986
01:11:25,576 --> 01:11:27,256
you promised to go, right?

987
01:11:36,930 --> 01:11:39,930
Why did you go on a blind date with me when that had happened?

988
01:11:40,757 --> 01:11:41,788
It was inevitable.

989
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:43,124
It was inevitable?

990
01:11:44,326 --> 01:11:46,389
Nakan takes care of me a lot.

991
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,178
So what about today?

992
01:11:48,889 --> 01:11:50,553
I have no idea.

993
01:11:52,260 --> 01:11:55,061
But if I did that, I would have declined today

994
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:05,543
I wanna be happy too.

995
01:12:06,620 --> 01:12:09,620
Thanks for saying so.

996
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,086
I invited you here without knowing that it was a restaurant with such memories

997
01:12:13,356 --> 01:12:16,356
It's natural for me to be declined, but you come

998
01:12:16,570 --> 01:12:18,912
So I guess I can have a lot of hope

999
01:12:20,390 --> 01:12:24,853
By the way, I have a girl at my home.

1000
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:29,202
She's the only sister's child

1001
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,720
She lost her parents early, so I took her in

1002
01:12:34,070 --> 01:12:35,795
I think that girl is very cute

1003
01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:39,066
Even if you came to my house

1004
01:12:39,090 --> 01:12:42,090
To be honest, I might love her more than you

1005
01:12:43,799 --> 01:12:45,515
You love children

1006
01:12:45,549 --> 01:12:46,002
Yes.

1007
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,670
if you do that, there's nothing to worry about

1008
01:12:49,850 --> 01:12:51,686
I'm an experts at children.

1009
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:56,328
I'm a big hit with the kids.

1010
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,146
I've known that for some time.so I was completely at ease

1011
01:13:00,170 --> 01:13:02,134
What were you relieved about?

1012
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:04,835
I was relieved about absolutely everything

1013
01:13:08,092 --> 01:13:12,465
And I think you know my assets and income

1014
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:16,436
I studied in Germany for a long time

1015
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,121
I knew one German woman,

1016
01:13:21,475 --> 01:13:22,782
What else?

1017
01:13:24,263 --> 01:13:27,840
but I thought there were more.

1018
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:29,418
That's all.

1019
01:13:31,112 --> 01:13:35,024
Actually, you look very similar to a person.

1020
01:13:36,070 --> 01:13:40,268
I mean not your looks.

1021
01:13:40,886 --> 01:13:42,087
Is that how you feel.

1022
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:45,077
It's an honor.

1023
01:14:20,805 --> 01:14:22,105
Touch net.

1024
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:41,348
Big sister, yeah, I'm sad

1025
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:42,740
Why?

1026
01:14:46,328 --> 01:14:48,655
Are you really going to get married this time?

1027
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:59,951
Who will see your homework if I'm not here?

1028
01:15:00,591 --> 01:15:04,774
Well, I'll get my mom to look at it

1029
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:05,963
I see

1030
01:15:06,530 --> 01:15:08,826
but　you really have to study more

1031
01:15:09,210 --> 01:15:10,551
and do it yourself

1032
01:15:10,652 --> 01:15:11,192
Yes.

1033
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:22,556
Don't tell what Oharu said about the marriage.

1034
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:25,223
I won't say it.

1035
01:15:29,168 --> 01:15:30,128
Welcome back.

1036
01:15:30,153 --> 01:15:31,101
I'm home.

1037
01:15:32,187 --> 01:15:32,754
Yukiko?

1038
01:15:33,174 --> 01:15:34,187
What for ?

1039
01:15:34,326 --> 01:15:35,593
Nothing.

1040
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,528
Yukiko?

1041
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:46,391
She was away just before.

1042
01:15:48,433 --> 01:15:51,659
Yes, it seems that Yukiko-chan is into Hashiriya.

1043
01:15:52,042 --> 01:15:55,461
She has been waiting for you to call her.

1044
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:57,349
She's really lively.

1045
01:15:57,484 --> 01:15:59,164
But it's bad.

1046
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:02,587
Bring me tea and  so we can chat at leisure

1047
01:16:11,785 --> 01:16:13,531
I wanna eat sweets.

1048
01:16:13,556 --> 01:16:14,590
Ask Oharu.

1049
01:16:14,964 --> 01:16:16,110
Oharu.

1050
01:16:16,852 --> 01:16:18,402
I wanna eat sweets.

1051
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,813
Thank you very much.

1052
01:16:25,677 --> 01:16:27,380
You know what?

1053
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,723
The matchmaker called the office today.

1054
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:35,676
He said he wanted to cancel this matchmaking.

1055
01:16:37,029 --> 01:16:38,895
Why did he suddenly say that?

1056
01:16:39,332 --> 01:16:42,058
Hoshidera-san likes Yukiko a lot.

1057
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,378
The reason he refused was Koi.

1058
01:16:44,910 --> 01:16:47,903
She has been on good terms with a man since Itakura-san passed away.

1059
01:16:48,542 --> 01:16:50,620
I guess she seems to be living a bad life

1060
01:16:50,770 --> 01:16:53,770
It turned out that she had a sister like that.

1061
01:16:53,918 --> 01:16:55,934
Is that true?

1062
01:16:56,355 --> 01:16:58,425
I don't know the detail.

1063
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:00,434
My face was turning red.
I was embarrassed.

1064
01:17:18,155 --> 01:17:21,011
Is koi really such a bad woman?

1065
01:17:22,910 --> 01:17:25,546
The engagement was ruined because of her.

1066
01:17:25,570 --> 01:17:27,465
This is such a stupid thing

1067
01:17:30,911 --> 01:17:33,145
I don't know what to do.

1068
01:17:39,618 --> 01:17:46,832
I'm lonely or sad?, I need to get a clearer picture of my feelings

1069
01:17:49,049 --> 01:17:51,675
Say I'm not here.

1070
01:17:51,700 --> 01:17:53,306
That's what I said

1071
01:17:53,330 --> 01:17:56,330
Please just say something nice and don't let him in

1072
01:18:01,886 --> 01:18:03,081
She's here.

1073
01:18:03,106 --> 01:18:04,052
But

1074
01:18:04,091 --> 01:18:06,613
You are a liar.

1075
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,083
You keep missing our plans after this

1076
01:18:12,700 --> 01:18:13,606
You think so?

1077
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:16,265
I was disowned

1078
01:18:16,290 --> 01:18:18,450
Is it the end of money, the end of ties?

1079
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:19,544
What a stupid.

1080
01:18:19,665 --> 01:18:22,665
You talk like a gangster.

1081
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:24,966
So you are like what?

1082
01:18:25,341 --> 01:18:26,730
I have no idea.

1083
01:18:26,755 --> 01:18:29,082
You're just whore.

1084
01:18:29,850 --> 01:18:33,605
Who is the guy you've been hanging out with lately?

1085
01:18:34,558 --> 01:18:36,590
Who is that guy called Miyoshi.

1086
01:18:37,817 --> 01:18:41,013
Go home.
I don't want to see your face.

1087
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,675
I won't go home.

1088
01:18:44,700 --> 01:18:47,700
I'll leave then

1089
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:01,356
Welcome home

1090
01:19:01,381 --> 01:19:02,427
customer?

1091
01:19:02,731 --> 01:19:04,856
Baya from Okuhata is here.

1092
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:15,926
He still think the same about koi.

1093
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,535
so please make her for his wife.

1094
01:19:25,734 --> 01:19:32,316
After all, Bonbon and Koi have such a long-standing relationship that it was even featured in the newspapers

1095
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,981
What would happen to him if koi-san abandon him now?

1096
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,942
She's Baya at Keibon's house.

1097
01:19:42,833 --> 01:19:44,606
Are you Yukiko?

1098
01:19:45,252 --> 01:19:46,692
Nice to meet you.

1099
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:53,239
Koi-san is causing so much trouble for Keibon about money?

1100
01:19:53,705 --> 01:19:58,120
Yes, I didn’t say anything like that

1101
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:03,510
But there is no way to do that

1102
01:20:08,876 --> 01:20:14,673
This is what I received when he put on your fur coat last winter

1103
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:21,549
And this was when he was making something called Afternoon

1104
01:20:23,507 --> 01:20:29,252
In fact, he brought a lot of items from the store for you.

1105
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:34,241
That being said, I am in no way betraying Koi-san

1106
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:36,626
I feel bad.

1107
01:20:36,650 --> 01:20:39,976
He did a lot for Koi.

1108
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:44,250
so please, please, please take care of it

1109
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:46,945
I have to go.

1110
01:20:53,836 --> 01:20:54,851
Oharu.

1111
01:20:56,148 --> 01:20:57,898
Where's her?

1112
01:21:27,125 --> 01:21:27,914
Koi.

1113
01:21:29,085 --> 01:21:31,859
Have a drink.

1114
01:21:35,637 --> 01:21:37,890
Keibo's Baya just visited us.

1115
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:39,929
Oharu told me.

1116
01:21:43,166 --> 01:21:46,944
I had a fight with Keibon and we broke up cleanly

1117
01:21:48,457 --> 01:21:51,686
If you're going to break up, then break up

1118
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:55,400
You have to make amends.

1119
01:21:57,590 --> 01:21:58,726
it's not like that

1120
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,860
He followed me around forever,

1121
01:22:03,880 --> 01:22:05,210
I was so annoying.

1122
01:22:06,050 --> 01:22:10,700
But Keibon have been causing a lot of financial trouble

1123
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:14,030
That's ridiculous and it's definitely not true

1124
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:16,128
Seriously?

1125
01:22:17,667 --> 01:22:20,249
I've been doing my own thing.

1126
01:22:20,930 --> 01:22:23,930
You know I was saving money too

1127
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:26,897
People don't think that way.

1128
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:29,756
There's no job for Keibon.

1129
01:22:31,623 --> 01:22:35,046
I was thinking that if I had to support Keibon, I would

1130
01:22:37,223 --> 01:22:38,484
Well, I'd like to ask

1131
01:22:39,025 --> 01:22:44,452
Wasn't the fur coat you got last winter made by KEIBON?

1132
01:22:45,273 --> 01:22:51,523
I was selling a rose-patterned haori and a kimono that fit into a vertical frame,and bought it.

1133
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:56,101
but the old lady at Keibon said, "I paid for that."

1134
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,800
She showed me the receipt.

1135
01:22:59,269 --> 01:23:02,905
That afternoon dress was like that too.

1136
01:23:03,323 --> 01:23:06,125
I don't want you to believe what she says.

1137
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,866
I want to trust Uchika and Ko-san, but

1138
01:23:11,890 --> 01:23:14,242
The Baya has solid evidence

1139
01:23:15,395 --> 01:23:16,825
If that's the case, then

1140
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:19,496
Well, how about you show me some real evidence?

1141
01:23:21,812 --> 01:23:28,317
She said she remembers the ring, the brooch, everything.

1142
01:23:29,582 --> 01:23:31,106
He was disowned

1143
01:23:31,545 --> 01:23:34,545
Apparently, she said he was the cause of the problem when he took out the jewels from the store

1144
01:23:34,830 --> 01:23:36,293
That's not fair

1145
01:23:36,614 --> 01:23:37,388
She said that.

1146
01:23:39,895 --> 01:23:41,067
Koi-san

1147
01:23:42,997 --> 01:23:45,340
The thing I want to say most about all of this is,

1148
01:23:45,365 --> 01:23:49,457
Why didn't you clearly break up with Keibon while you were dating Itakura-san?

1149
01:23:50,570 --> 01:23:54,489
People might think that you took money from KEIBON and supported ITAKURA.

1150
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:57,035
That's something you do in night business.

1151
01:23:59,114 --> 01:24:00,785
You just used him

1152
01:24:01,530 --> 01:24:03,520
Now he is no longer be of any use.

1153
01:24:03,545 --> 01:24:05,739
You say such horrible things to him

1154
01:24:07,470 --> 01:24:10,470
why can't you reply?

1155
01:24:13,101 --> 01:24:17,973
I'm going to Tokyo again soon, but I'll just say this

1156
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:23,707
Until now, I only wish your happiness.

1157
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:31,528
It would be ridiculous to think that a
woman can find true happiness that way

1158
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:35,036
You doesn't understand my feelings

1159
01:24:35,061 --> 01:24:35,888
Why?

1160
01:24:35,913 --> 01:24:37,403
You doesn't understand my feelings

1161
01:25:34,870 --> 01:25:36,832
The doctor will come soon

1162
01:25:41,117 --> 01:25:44,117
Yukiko says she won't return to Tokyo and will take care of you.

1163
01:25:45,068 --> 01:25:46,387
I'm sorry

1164
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:52,613
I know about my health

1165
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:57,950
Maybe three or four mouth.

1166
01:25:59,395 --> 01:26:00,981
Keibon's baby?

1167
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:05,645
If so

1168
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:09,832
Miyoshi's baby.

1169
01:26:11,110 --> 01:26:12,746
He is a bartender.

1170
01:26:13,153 --> 01:26:16,153
You're going to have his baby?

1171
01:26:17,630 --> 01:26:19,333
I want to have a baby if I can.

1172
01:26:39,179 --> 01:26:40,645
Take care of yourself.

1173
01:26:52,231 --> 01:26:55,496
Who will tell koi that she has an ectopic pregnancy?

1174
01:26:56,469 --> 01:26:58,684
Yukiko said she would let him know herself.

1175
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:03,458
In ectopic pregnancies, the baby is often unhealthy.

1176
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:07,629
On the contrary, the doctor said that her body is also damaged.

1177
01:27:12,598 --> 01:27:13,614
Kian

1178
01:27:14,389 --> 01:27:17,481
You haven't slept since last night

1179
01:27:19,309 --> 01:27:21,325
You don't have to worry about that

1180
01:27:22,575 --> 01:27:23,911
I’m sorry.

1181
01:27:24,475 --> 01:27:28,067
You've become completely weak-hearted.

1182
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:34,489
I'm sure you hate me.

1183
01:27:34,927 --> 01:27:35,583
Why?

1184
01:27:36,963 --> 01:27:38,137
For my sake

1185
01:27:39,711 --> 01:27:42,989
Hashidara did a lot to me.

1186
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,309
That's enough.

1187
01:27:47,170 --> 01:27:48,590
But

1188
01:27:48,692 --> 01:27:50,567
Let's talk after you get better.

1189
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:55,785
Hold my hand tightly

1190
01:28:27,340 --> 01:28:28,957
Yoneyan.

1191
01:28:31,184 --> 01:28:32,888
Yoneyan.

1192
01:28:38,559 --> 01:28:39,473
Yoneyan.

1193
01:28:42,220 --> 01:28:44,356
Yoneyan means Itakura.

1194
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:47,989
Is she dreaming of Itakura?

1195
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:54,762
As expected, the person she like the most is Itakura-san

1196
01:28:56,040 --> 01:28:59,040
I think that's pretty clear

1197
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:00,817
Honestly,

1198
01:29:02,061 --> 01:29:07,981
She'll die because of Itakura-san.

1199
01:29:08,348 --> 01:29:10,856
Why you say like that?

1200
01:29:11,709 --> 01:29:14,003
She is having surgery today

1201
01:29:14,107 --> 01:29:15,715
Don't wake her up

1202
01:29:20,763 --> 01:29:22,044
Dawn is almost here

1203
01:30:00,778 --> 01:30:05,873
I feel like I can forgive anything what Koi-san did.

1204
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:09,720
I think Koi-san just tried her best

1205
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:13,177
To grab the second happiness.

1206
01:30:13,471 --> 01:30:14,238
To grab the second happiness?

1207
01:30:15,067 --> 01:30:18,980
For her,The first happiness has died.

1208
01:30:19,303 --> 01:30:20,436
About Itakura?

1209
01:30:21,362 --> 01:30:25,643
She worked hard to grab the second happiness.

1210
01:30:26,276 --> 01:30:29,782
I guess She's become unable to distinguish between good and bad things

1211
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:32,210
It's no wonder

1212
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:35,338
She was naive by nature.

1213
01:30:36,858 --> 01:30:37,898
Yukiko.

1214
01:30:40,439 --> 01:30:44,724
You turned down a marriage proposal with Mr. Hashidera for the sake of KOI.

1215
01:30:47,143 --> 01:30:48,730
It was not for her.

1216
01:30:50,082 --> 01:30:52,195
A marriage proposal that will be ruined because of her

1217
01:30:53,944 --> 01:30:55,820
I have no regrets at all.

1218
01:30:57,223 --> 01:31:04,687
I want to marry someone who genuinely loves me.

1219
01:31:05,340 --> 01:31:06,342
Is that really true?

1220
01:31:06,580 --> 01:31:07,767
Why?

1221
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:11,624
I've always wondered about that.

1222
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,258
That's funny.

1223
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:20,648
I was relieved to hear that, but when I see what Koi-san do

1224
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:24,590
I sometimes wonder if we're real sisters.

1225
01:31:24,686 --> 01:31:26,249
Don't say anything stupid.

1226
01:31:26,399 --> 01:31:30,411
I don't know what koi-san do.

1227
01:31:47,800 --> 01:31:49,734
I was glad Koi-san was saved.

1228
01:31:52,699 --> 01:31:54,559
At least her life was saved.

1229
01:31:55,563 --> 01:31:57,222
But the child was dead.

1230
01:31:57,874 --> 01:31:59,864
That may not have been my child.

1231
01:32:00,337 --> 01:32:01,397
Can you go to by Tobacco for me?

1232
01:32:03,914 --> 01:32:06,165
I'm not going to threaten her.

1233
01:32:07,317 --> 01:32:10,707
Are you going to marry her to the bartender?

1234
01:32:11,266 --> 01:32:13,164
We'll discuss it together someday.

1235
01:32:13,691 --> 01:32:14,905
He was a sailor.

1236
01:32:15,190 --> 01:32:17,206
I don't know what kind of man he is

1237
01:32:18,128 --> 01:32:19,387
Yes, I have given that much thought

1238
01:32:20,645 --> 01:32:26,323
Ah, I really can't break up with the person I've been with for so long

1239
01:32:26,914 --> 01:32:27,347
But.

1240
01:32:27,469 --> 01:32:30,662
You already knew everything

1241
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:34,196
These days, I'm struggling to even afford my own money

1242
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:37,568
Koi has put up a lot of my money.

1243
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:41,272
Well, I think I've already returned all the various items

1244
01:32:41,966 --> 01:32:43,242
How much money is that?

1245
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:46,764
How much would you give it from you?

1246
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:50,442
I am very short of money right now

1247
01:32:52,993 --> 01:32:53,973
Excuse me.

1248
01:32:54,805 --> 01:32:57,805
Hello?
Oh it's you.

1249
01:32:58,870 --> 01:33:00,653
I got a letter from Tokyo

1250
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:03,330
I had some business to attend to, so I'm sorry

1251
01:33:03,362 --> 01:33:05,378
My sister is coming here next month.

1252
01:33:05,713 --> 01:33:08,309
So I decided to have Yukiko-chan stay here until then

1253
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:29,340
Miyoshi.

1254
01:33:31,059 --> 01:33:32,458
Here isn't cheap.

1255
01:33:34,009 --> 01:33:37,391
Someone really wanted to meet you.

1256
01:33:42,513 --> 01:33:43,267
Who is this?

1257
01:33:44,184 --> 01:33:45,044
I'm Miyoshi.

1258
01:33:45,618 --> 01:33:47,243
I'm the sister of Taeko

1259
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:48,443
Why you came here?

1260
01:33:48,850 --> 01:33:50,213
I wanted to meet you.

1261
01:33:50,987 --> 01:33:51,920
For what?

1262
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:57,874
Did you come to say that you are against me marrying the Taeko?

1263
01:33:58,710 --> 01:34:01,388
If so, what would you do?

1264
01:34:01,810 --> 01:34:02,650
I don't care.

1265
01:34:04,316 --> 01:34:07,671
I have a responsibility to her as a man.

1266
01:34:09,149 --> 01:34:12,682
No matter what anyone says, I will bring her to me.

1267
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,050
If you do that, it's not like that kind of business

1268
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,794
Are you saying you'd like to help pay for her wedding?

1269
01:34:21,702 --> 01:34:22,695
I'll turn down.

1270
01:34:24,150 --> 01:34:27,150
What I want is her, not money.

1271
01:34:28,780 --> 01:34:30,616
This is a place where people like you come,

1272
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:32,816
so why don't you go home?

1273
01:34:59,023 --> 01:35:00,423
What do you see all the time?

1274
01:35:01,628 --> 01:35:05,750
Big sister, Makioka's house is gone

1275
01:35:05,980 --> 01:35:08,140
and a building like this is going to stand in its place

1276
01:35:08,610 --> 01:35:09,537
Seriously

1277
01:35:10,855 --> 01:35:12,988
the neighborhood has completely changed too.

1278
01:35:13,612 --> 01:35:15,855
I'm disappointed that the town has changed.

1279
01:35:15,948 --> 01:35:17,481
Is everything alright for you?

1280
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:19,808
I'm not saying it's alright

1281
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:23,793
I feel like I cry.

1282
01:35:24,526 --> 01:35:26,170
That house was sold

1283
01:35:26,429 --> 01:35:28,302
The house now belongs to the buyer.

1284
01:35:28,740 --> 01:35:31,598
Do you care about anything?

1285
01:35:32,453 --> 01:35:34,741
I thought you would be the one to start crying

1286
01:35:36,130 --> 01:35:39,857
I had a hard time after going to Tokyo. I can't remembered the past.

1287
01:35:42,595 --> 01:35:43,692
Come on, let's go home.

1288
01:35:53,148 --> 01:35:55,705
Are you really going,Koi-san?

1289
01:35:57,041 --> 01:35:58,407
My sister from Tokyo is coming

1290
01:35:58,859 --> 01:36:00,116
I don't wanna see her.

1291
01:36:01,779 --> 01:36:04,779
I'll have to see you again someday, but I can't do it right now

1292
01:36:04,848 --> 01:36:07,408
I don't wanna see her now.

1293
01:36:11,290 --> 01:36:14,290
Please return this to Keibon.

1294
01:36:14,817 --> 01:36:16,192
I lost one of them.

1295
01:36:16,629 --> 01:36:18,046
This is a real pearl.

1296
01:36:21,953 --> 01:36:24,953
Do you think I am really stupid?

1297
01:36:26,390 --> 01:36:27,187
Why?

1298
01:36:29,013 --> 01:36:33,855
Since I met Mr. Itakura, I have understood who I should love.

1299
01:36:35,522 --> 01:36:38,522
But I couldn't forget about luxury.

1300
01:36:42,223 --> 01:36:48,195
I was confused, but I was using Keibon to manipulate money.

1301
01:36:50,992 --> 01:36:52,238
I feel sorry for Keibon.

1302
01:36:54,503 --> 01:36:59,032
If you notice that much, Keibon will forgive you.

1303
01:37:01,002 --> 01:37:02,523
What happened to Miyoshi today?

1304
01:37:03,542 --> 01:37:05,582
He's back in Ashiya and waiting for me.

1305
01:37:06,287 --> 01:37:08,411
He said he'd like to go find a room with me.

1306
01:37:09,130 --> 01:37:10,091
Room?

1307
01:37:11,011 --> 01:37:14,457
He said he wanted to do that.

1308
01:37:15,375 --> 01:37:16,049
I see.

1309
01:37:20,280 --> 01:37:25,160
Koi-san, you really like Miyoshi, don't you?

1310
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:28,136
Why do you ask that?

1311
01:37:29,955 --> 01:37:31,322
I'm sure if you are with Miyoshi

1312
01:37:32,266 --> 01:37:34,692
You'd be able to endure any hardship.

1313
01:37:37,350 --> 01:37:39,366
You're thinking of renting out the room

1314
01:37:40,530 --> 01:37:42,645
If you do it, you have to make a decision

1315
01:37:43,841 --> 01:37:47,434
Do you doubt us?

1316
01:37:48,985 --> 01:37:50,785
I won't tell you what to say though

1317
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:52,935
But How good is the other person...

1318
01:37:53,903 --> 01:37:58,489
Can you stand living in poverty?

1319
01:37:59,106 --> 01:38:01,450
You can't do that

1320
01:38:02,505 --> 01:38:03,036
What?

1321
01:38:03,457 --> 01:38:04,684
but he came out and did something wrong

1322
01:38:04,876 --> 01:38:12,418
I'm a dirty woman dating a bad man like bartender.

1323
01:38:13,200 --> 01:38:14,285
Koi

1324
01:38:14,911 --> 01:38:19,551
I think you despise me but I have my own way of life

1325
01:38:20,540 --> 01:38:23,096
From now on, leave me alone

1326
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:24,348
You don't know my feelings

1327
01:38:24,809 --> 01:38:25,559
Koi.

1328
01:38:31,042 --> 01:38:35,004
why do you say things like that?

1329
01:38:36,430 --> 01:38:38,950
I met Miyoshi.

1330
01:38:39,455 --> 01:38:43,262
I wouldn't do something like that! Honestly if I don't care you.

1331
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:44,833
Really?

1332
01:38:45,411 --> 01:38:47,403
my sister in the main family was against you.

1333
01:38:47,835 --> 01:38:50,182
I will convince your sister

1334
01:38:51,640 --> 01:38:54,640
My mom came back with her aunt from Tokyo

1335
01:38:55,511 --> 01:38:56,316
so I'll be there soon

1336
01:38:57,480 --> 01:39:00,480
Well then, Koi-san, please wait a moment

1337
01:39:01,010 --> 01:39:04,010
After all, Koi-san was born at the youngest age in a family of only women

1338
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:07,516
When she was little, she had a pitch black face

1339
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:10,540
She was called a dirty kid and wasn't loved very much

1340
01:39:11,090 --> 01:39:14,628
So, she don't have to like bartenders

1341
01:39:17,698 --> 01:39:20,050
Welcome.

1342
01:39:20,425 --> 01:39:22,175
Hello?

1343
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,303
you look fine

1344
01:39:24,897 --> 01:39:25,932
I'm just strong.

1345
01:39:27,485 --> 01:39:30,485
I guess you're doing your homework,

1346
01:39:30,573 --> 01:39:31,886
I'll take a look at it.

1347
01:39:35,117 --> 01:39:37,471
Give me the stick.

1348
01:39:38,714 --> 01:39:39,753
Thanks.

1349
01:39:42,987 --> 01:39:48,120
Did you tell your sister about KOI and Miyoshi?

1350
01:39:50,025 --> 01:39:53,025
I was just talking about that

1351
01:39:53,050 --> 01:39:55,619
I feel sorry for myself too.

1352
01:39:56,470 --> 01:39:57,235
Why?

1353
01:39:58,360 --> 01:40:01,766
No matter how much freedom you say you have,

1354
01:40:02,260 --> 01:40:05,657
After all, We need the right man for our home.

1355
01:40:06,454 --> 01:40:07,985
We care about public opinion.

1356
01:40:09,496 --> 01:40:11,368
You are too happy.

1357
01:40:12,210 --> 01:40:13,985
She has no more choices.

1358
01:40:14,502 --> 01:40:16,969
I don't know what kind of person he is.

1359
01:40:17,373 --> 01:40:20,373
Do you know the man

1360
01:40:20,500 --> 01:40:23,500
He's not rich but he's very manly.

1361
01:40:23,820 --> 01:40:26,656
I think she'll be happy with him.

1362
01:40:26,681 --> 01:40:30,266
Yukiko-chan, I agree with this idea.

1363
01:40:30,610 --> 01:40:31,321
Really?

1364
01:40:32,267 --> 01:40:33,845
She is against it.

1365
01:40:34,370 --> 01:40:39,344
The most important thing is personality.
I think our family agree this idea.

1366
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:44,321
Family background, lineage, and fortune are all gone

1367
01:40:45,462 --> 01:40:47,712
Thanks,Sis.

1368
01:40:50,053 --> 01:40:53,805
But you worry about Koi-san a lot.

1369
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:57,008
When will you be happy?

1370
01:40:58,321 --> 01:41:03,821
I'm still happy, and I have that feeling in my hearts.

1371
01:41:04,135 --> 01:41:06,071
You can't tell it from the outside.

1372
01:41:06,212 --> 01:41:07,196
Yeah but....

1373
01:41:07,665 --> 01:41:09,118
Don't worry.

1374
01:41:10,180 --> 01:41:13,180
I'll find my happiness for myself,

1375
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,501
I'll bring Koi-san.

1376
01:41:32,563 --> 01:41:35,087
Koi-san?
Koi-san?

1377
01:41:39,353 --> 01:41:40,485
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1378
01:41:46,743 --> 01:41:48,220
I can't find Koi-san.

1379
01:41:55,498 --> 01:41:58,498
She told me that she met Miyoshi at the station.

1380
01:41:59,540 --> 01:42:00,407
I'm going.

1381
01:42:00,532 --> 01:42:01,845
Hold on.

1382
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:08,063
I'm talking about money Koi-san wants.

1383
01:42:08,877 --> 01:42:11,877
That is actually what we are keeping

1384
01:42:13,098 --> 01:42:17,204
I used it when my child was sick.

1385
01:42:18,780 --> 01:42:20,555
That's fine.

1386
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:22,329
Hold on.

1387
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,383
Say this to Koi-san.

1388
01:42:25,376 --> 01:42:29,306
Please tell her that I will pay for your wedding.

1389
01:42:40,259 --> 01:42:41,173
She's coming.

1390
01:43:05,688 --> 01:43:08,429
Your sisters in Tokyo have agreed to your marriage.

1391
01:43:08,454 --> 01:43:09,064
Ok?

1392
01:43:09,890 --> 01:43:11,969
If you find a room, please come back right away.

1393
01:43:12,450 --> 01:43:14,930
We congratulate you.

1394
01:43:15,728 --> 01:43:16,696
Ok?

1395
01:43:24,745 --> 01:43:26,704
Yukiko was on time?

1396
01:43:30,110 --> 01:43:30,931
Sis.

1397
01:43:33,380 --> 01:43:37,226
Come to think of it, it seems my way of thinking is the oldest among my siblings

1398
01:43:39,103 --> 01:43:44,089
It's like there's a disembodied something stuck somewhere in my head forever

1399
01:43:44,735 --> 01:43:45,295
Yeah.

1400
01:43:46,290 --> 01:43:48,942
Sachiko-chan doesn't have any troubles,

1401
01:43:49,074 --> 01:43:52,340
You think so?
I'm sorry.

1402
01:44:02,836 --> 01:44:04,335
Sister, It's snowing.

1403
01:44:05,115 --> 01:44:06,009
Really.

1404
01:44:50,962 --> 01:44:58,665
THE END.

00:01:09,547 --> 00:01:11,757
Early Showa period (1926-1989 CE)

4
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:25,281
I don't know who will win.

5
00:01:25,703 --> 00:01:28,875
I want them to fight to the death.

6
00:01:35,984 --> 00:01:37,023
Let’s go

7
00:01:37,726 --> 00:01:40,015
Get out of my way

8
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:40,875
What the hell?

9
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,695
Shut up!

10
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:45,039
What are you doing here?

11
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:46,375
Who are you?

12
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:48,320
Me?
I'm from Takayasu

13
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:49,891
Get out of my way

14
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,016
Who is doing this?

15
00:01:54,117 --> 00:01:55,273
You?

16
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:58,734
What are you doing here?

17
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,781
I know you stole it from us

18
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:04,750
What the hell are you talking about?

19
00:02:05,133 --> 00:02:07,406
Don't say bullshit

20
00:02:08,117 --> 00:02:09,961
Who the hell do you think you are?

21
00:02:10,132 --> 00:02:12,343
You stoke it,
Fuck you

22
00:02:14,336 --> 00:02:16,000
Bring it on

23
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,031
I'll fight with him

24
00:02:18,664 --> 00:02:19,469
Come on

25
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:21,508
Don't stop me

26
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,445
Fuck you

27
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:35,820
Fuck you

28
00:02:38,063 --> 00:02:39,391
Wait!

29
00:02:41,164 --> 00:02:42,383
Wait!

30
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:44,516
Catch him!

31
00:02:47,352 --> 00:02:48,391
She's here

32
00:02:49,078 --> 00:02:54,109
People who play in this sacred place are fools.

33
00:02:54,852 --> 00:02:57,914
Don't bet the birds.

34
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,141
It's not good to take someone's bird.

35
00:03:02,328 --> 00:03:07,179
Peasants should only be peasants.

36
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,383
Don't think about anything else.

37
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,352
Shame on you!

38
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:15,711
Return the bird from now on

39
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,375
I returned the bird

40
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:46,961
Talk to your brother that I returned the bird

41
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,961
It's too bad, because I could have made some interesting bets.

42
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,250
There are women.

43
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:02,781
Really? Are there women?

44
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:08,984
Which Bon festival?

45
00:04:09,009 --> 00:04:09,609
Takayasu

46
00:04:09,969 --> 00:04:12,211
I can't go there.
I can't get along with people in there

47
00:04:13,164 --> 00:04:16,094
If you're worried, disguise yourself as a woman.

48
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,086
Enjoy your dancing

49
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,344
Let's dance together

50
00:04:58,336 --> 00:04:59,906
What the hell you are

51
00:05:00,148 --> 00:05:02,031
Oh you are man

52
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,250
Fuck you

53
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:37,984
How you know I was there?

54
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:39,789
It was easy to find you

55
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:43,477
What?

56
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,281
You look cute

57
00:05:45,836 --> 00:05:47,563
I practiced with my friend

58
00:05:48,703 --> 00:05:50,203
Have a seat

59
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:55,133
You live in Nakano village

60
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:56,375
Yes

61
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:01,484
What are you doing?

62
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,453
Can you meet me sometimes?

63
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:39,211
I feel like the Bon Dance Festival was a long time
ago.

64
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:43,914
You didn't drink alcohol.

65
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:45,695
Really

66
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,266
Why you can't drink?

67
00:06:49,063 --> 00:06:51,867
I have no idea

68
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:56,125
You are strong with women but weak with alcohol.

69
00:07:03,672 --> 00:07:07,414
Actually I'm married

70
00:07:08,695 --> 00:07:12,891
I kept it a secret.

71
00:07:18,477 --> 00:07:24,266
I was the first to know the joys of womanhood.

72
00:07:29,648 --> 00:07:32,195
I have your baby

73
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:41,820
In a little while my belly will grow.

74
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:46,227
Can we escape together?

75
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,242
Are we going to elope?

76
00:07:49,789 --> 00:07:52,695
Someone introduce me inn job

77
00:08:28,547 --> 00:08:33,555
It's boring for a young person like you to do nothing.

78
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:44,789
This old lady used to be a beautiful geisha.

79
00:08:45,398 --> 00:08:48,414
She was popular with men.

80
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:54,555
She had a bad life.

81
00:08:57,031 --> 00:09:01,031
You are still young, so think about life often.

82
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:07,844
We'll have a baby?

83
00:09:08,555 --> 00:09:10,969
I don't think so

84
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,039
I think she miscarried.

85
00:09:14,656 --> 00:09:16,438
She wasn't pregnant from the beginning.

86
00:09:21,547 --> 00:09:24,656
You should go home

87
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,258
It hurts me

88
00:09:42,891 --> 00:09:45,828
Don't hold me too tight

89
00:09:46,523 --> 00:09:47,461
Never mind

90
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:55,961
Kiyo-san

91
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,531
I need to go home

92
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:05,805
It's ok

93
00:10:07,883 --> 00:10:08,430
Then

94
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:21,109
Can you pick me up?

95
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:22,367
Don't say bullshit

96
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:25,328
I'm leaving

97
00:10:25,453 --> 00:10:28,101
Where are you going?

98
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,382
I'll go back to my hometown

99
00:10:29,407 --> 00:10:31,398
Please don't dump me

100
00:10:32,086 --> 00:10:36,859
I'll start working diligently tomorrow, so stay here.

101
00:10:37,156 --> 00:10:38,602
I don't care

102
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,023
You

103
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,484
Asakichi!

104
00:11:14,109 --> 00:11:15,438
What are you up to?

105
00:11:15,463 --> 00:11:18,008
What are you up to too?

106
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:19,383
We are on the way of coming back from Osaka

107
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:21,375
Were you in Osaka?

108
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:27,275
We had some fun in the city of Osaka and were ready to go home, but decided to go straight home after all!

109
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:30,463
Then let's play together, shall we?

110
00:11:30,955 --> 00:11:32,306
Let's go!

111
00:11:45,322 --> 00:11:46,556
Oh she's coming

112
00:11:46,783 --> 00:11:49,103
We were waiting for you

113
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,861
Good evening

114
00:11:53,025 --> 00:11:54,494
Have a seat

115
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:59,572
Let's have a drink together

116
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:03,314
Very beautiful women have come

117
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:06,181
Let's drink!

118
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:08,462
Where have you guys been?

119
00:12:08,487 --> 00:12:13,064
I met a beautiful woman at a tea shop.

120
00:12:24,135 --> 00:12:25,150
Have a drink

121
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:25,963
I can't drink

122
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:27,174
You can drink

123
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:29,150
Thanks

124
00:12:34,135 --> 00:12:38,103
Are you hitting on her?

125
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:42,275
It's none of your business

126
00:12:44,697 --> 00:12:45,603
Let's go out

127
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,478
Your name is Oi?

128
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,174
How do you know my name?

129
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:30,931
Your name is written on this list

130
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:35,244
My nickname is Kotoito

131
00:13:35,924 --> 00:13:37,181
Were you dancer

132
00:13:37,861 --> 00:13:41,853
I used to work in Hakata

133
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:44,189
Why you are here?

134
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:48,439
I also had various circumstances

135
00:13:49,752 --> 00:13:52,994
Because my dad got sick

136
00:13:56,189 --> 00:13:59,377
They are so kids

137
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:08,588
Did I do something wrong?

138
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:10,596
Look them in the eye and talk to them.

139
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,751
Who are you?

140
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:17,752
What the hell?
You'll fight with me?

141
00:14:21,783 --> 00:14:22,611
Fuck you

142
00:14:22,924 --> 00:14:26,377
What kind of yakuza are you?

143
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:30,931
I won't move from here

144
00:14:31,493 --> 00:14:34,361
What this woman. I'll kick her ass

145
00:14:34,588 --> 00:14:36,361
Stop it

146
00:14:36,736 --> 00:14:38,368
Get out of here

147
00:14:38,619 --> 00:14:40,611
Beat me

148
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,954
Do you know who I am?

149
00:14:44,111 --> 00:14:45,736
Beat me

150
00:14:48,635 --> 00:14:49,760
Stop it

151
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:52,963
Fuck you

152
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:00,158
Beat me

153
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:04,478
Fuck you

154
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:08,424
Fuck you

155
00:15:09,728 --> 00:15:10,900
Damn it

156
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,744
I'm glad everyone is settling in.

157
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,517
I was worried

158
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:46,127
If you didn't stop I would also participate

159
00:15:46,877 --> 00:15:49,213
I hate arrogant people

160
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,260
I know how you feel

161
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:58,221
You are on the side of the weak.

162
00:15:59,931 --> 00:16:00,650
Right

163
00:16:07,963 --> 00:16:14,588
I wish you could help me too.

164
00:16:15,213 --> 00:16:17,283
I'm sick of life like this

165
00:16:21,056 --> 00:16:23,564
You have a tough time dealing with lowly customers

166
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:27,033
It's so hard

167
00:16:28,002 --> 00:16:31,892
You are young and beautiful, so I think you can have an elegant customer.

168
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:35,533
You should make a lot of money and quit this job

169
00:16:39,447 --> 00:16:40,494
Are you sleeping soon?

170
00:16:41,783 --> 00:16:43,486
I think so

171
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:52,158
It's embarrassing to take off your clothes for the first time

172
00:17:33,931 --> 00:17:35,572
Hey it's morning

173
00:17:39,212 --> 00:17:39,767
What?

174
00:17:43,994 --> 00:17:45,346
It's ok if you come in

175
00:17:48,814 --> 00:17:49,510
What's wrong?

176
00:17:50,424 --> 00:17:53,416
That men are loitering outside.

177
00:17:53,494 --> 00:17:55,236
They're waiting for you guys

178
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:55,775
You

179
00:17:55,814 --> 00:17:56,783
Don't worry

180
00:17:57,338 --> 00:18:02,096
Have a leisurely breakfast and stand tall.

181
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,517
Hey, can you wait

182
00:18:15,542 --> 00:18:16,166
What?

183
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:18,314
We came to get revenge last night

184
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:21,111
We don't have time to deal with you

185
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:24,775
You say something interesting

186
00:18:25,611 --> 00:18:30,049
This is our territory.
I'm Sadayan of Yoshioka Group

187
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,689
You have shamed us.

188
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:36,783
We'll beat you guys

189
00:19:28,955 --> 00:19:29,963
Run away!

190
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,431
I lost

191
00:19:46,572 --> 00:19:47,510
It's over

192
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:51,572
Are you real Yakuza from Yoshioka group?

193
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:58,916
Hey guys. You are Yoshioka group's.
Don't fight in front of the store in the morning.

194
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:01,010
You'll pay for what you broke.

195
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,767
I didn’t break

196
00:20:02,877 --> 00:20:04,548
You've broken this

197
00:20:05,025 --> 00:20:07,197
You'll pay for what you broke.

198
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,416
Look this

199
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:09,760
How much?

200
00:20:09,939 --> 00:20:12,056
It costs a lot

201
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:13,994
Make it cheap

202
00:20:14,236 --> 00:20:17,096
It's your responsibility.
It's Ok if you pay 10 yen

203
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:18,939
Don't do this anymore

204
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:20,869
You guys are so asshole

205
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:24,549
Do you have any complaints?
Let's go

206
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:31,470
I want to go out with you guys if you forget this fight.

207
00:20:31,495 --> 00:20:34,822
What?
We can't go out with you

208
00:20:35,064 --> 00:20:36,447
Let's go

209
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:40,189
Hey you, can you wait?

210
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,508
What?

211
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,227
I'm Yoshioka.
This is my territory

212
00:20:45,766 --> 00:20:48,938
Ok? can you come with me?

213
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:51,672
To where?

214
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:54,360
My place

215
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,188
Asayan

216
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:59,625
I have no choice to go

217
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:00,821
But

218
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:02,851
Don't worry

219
00:21:15,492 --> 00:21:20,102
Our yakuza SADA is very powerful

220
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,117
But you beaten him

221
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:24,531
You are very strong

222
00:21:24,556 --> 00:21:29,055
I'm not very strong.
I'm sure he's stronger if he gets serious

223
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:32,133
Stop complimenting

224
00:21:32,414 --> 00:21:33,735
Where are you going from now on?

225
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,071
I have nowhere to go

226
00:21:36,492 --> 00:21:39,336
Why don't you stay here?

227
00:21:40,946 --> 00:21:42,836
Am I going to be your henchman?

228
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:43,688
I don't mean that

229
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,016
I'm not forcing you

230
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,679
I hate yakuza

231
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,477
You are treated as a customer

232
00:21:52,172 --> 00:21:54,321
What kind of business do you do here?

233
00:21:54,594 --> 00:21:58,047
It ’s like a lawyer.
We can earn money a lot

234
00:21:58,508 --> 00:21:59,867
We sometimes quarrel

235
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:05,789
Have a drink and think about it.

236
00:22:06,155 --> 00:22:07,858
I can't drink

237
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,180
Oh I see

238
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:10,750
Sada

239
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,211
Punish them

240
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:23,461
Chuko

241
00:22:24,289 --> 00:22:25,297
Stand up

242
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:28,828
You ran away

243
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:30,164
You ran away

244
00:22:30,189 --> 00:22:31,195
You were scared and tried to escape

245
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,594
Shut up!

246
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:34,344
Forgive me

247
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:35,610
Shige

248
00:22:36,516 --> 00:22:40,352
I just went to ask for a helper

249
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,180
Don't make excuses

250
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,789
Forgive me

251
00:22:57,391 --> 00:22:58,461
Stop it

252
00:22:58,486 --> 00:22:59,789
Don't stop him

253
00:23:00,953 --> 00:23:02,383
This is our rule

254
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,914
This is because of my quarrel

255
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:09,758
I'm tired of hearing their excuses

256
00:23:10,805 --> 00:23:13,890
They ran away for some reason

257
00:23:14,203 --> 00:23:17,070
Please forgive them

258
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,774
Forgive them if you work with us

259
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,883
It can't be helped if you ask

260
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,547
Ok I'll work here

261
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:35,399
OK,  Sada, forgive them

262
00:23:37,203 --> 00:23:41,899
I hope they take good care of me, but it's not.

263
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:45,672
It is reassuring to know you are here.

264
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,336
I've only known you a short time, but we're already good friends.

265
00:23:56,531 --> 00:23:58,102
There are hostile Yakuza.

266
00:23:59,406 --> 00:24:00,258
There are hostile Yakuza.

267
00:24:00,836 --> 00:24:03,828
There is a yakuza who is fighting for territory with us

268
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:05,867
I'm his bouncer, right?

269
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:08,758
That's what I though

270
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:11,086
It ’s pretty good to live here.

271
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:12,149
I felt uncomfortable when I heard that

272
00:24:12,406 --> 00:24:13,696
Don't say that

273
00:24:18,078 --> 00:24:20,360
Bros, you like betting?

274
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:21,524
I like it

275
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,859
Shall we bet on the dice?

276
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,508
Ready? Let's play

277
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:37,789
Play!

278
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:45,180
One more

279
00:24:45,992 --> 00:24:47,196
I bet more

280
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,719
I bet on cho

281
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,071
What should we bet on?

282
00:24:59,367 --> 00:25:01,711
Everyone bet on Cho, no one bet on Han

283
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,531
This will not be a match

284
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:08,391
You guys are just looking at it

285
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,500
Can you bet on Han?

286
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:12,406
Am I the only one to put on Han?

287
00:25:12,875 --> 00:25:13,563
How much?

288
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:14,805
30yen

289
00:25:14,852 --> 00:25:15,711
30yen

290
00:25:16,571 --> 00:25:17,696
Ok I'll bet

291
00:25:19,883 --> 00:25:20,891
Ok you bet 30 yen

292
00:25:22,742 --> 00:25:25,203
Ok? ready?

293
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,516
Play!

294
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,899
I'm leaving

295
00:25:38,047 --> 00:25:39,203
Are you leaving?

296
00:25:39,228 --> 00:25:40,937
that's too bad

297
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,336
I only play once

298
00:25:42,563 --> 00:25:45,071
Please play more

299
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:46,836
Don't win and run away with it.

300
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:53,321
It ’s not good to play until you run out of money

301
00:25:53,578 --> 00:25:55,429
You should be careful about how you speak

302
00:25:56,117 --> 00:25:57,727
Do you think we are fools?

303
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:02,281
I bet all the money I have

304
00:26:03,289 --> 00:26:06,930
If it was CHO you guys were taking my money

305
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:12,679
It does not mean that I win and run away with it.

306
00:26:13,555 --> 00:26:15,602
What the hell this kid

307
00:26:17,914 --> 00:26:19,531
Don't say bullshit

308
00:26:19,727 --> 00:26:21,367
Wait

309
00:26:23,703 --> 00:26:26,422
You are very funny

310
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:30,703
He just wanted you to have fun

311
00:26:30,852 --> 00:26:33,766
Ok I get it, so we are leaving

312
00:26:34,313 --> 00:26:37,305
Come here again

313
00:26:43,367 --> 00:26:44,008
Bros

314
00:26:45,313 --> 00:26:48,148
Thanks for helping me

315
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,719
What are you talking about?
You are fine

316
00:26:51,118 --> 00:26:52,352
You are so great

317
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,946
It's only right that I help our friends in the Yoshioka
clan.

318
00:26:54,971 --> 00:26:55,993
Yes right

319
00:26:57,251 --> 00:26:58,227
Keep half

320
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:00,088
Keep it

321
00:27:00,924 --> 00:27:01,776
Thanks

322
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,580
I'll go to Matsushima

323
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,557
What's wrong?

324
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,408
Good people like you will be gone someday.

325
00:27:31,424 --> 00:27:32,729
You are just my guest

326
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:38,424
What are you talking about?
I'm here

327
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:45,776
My father chastised me last night.

328
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:47,236
Why?

329
00:27:48,486 --> 00:27:50,666
Because I mistreated my customers.

330
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:57,244
That customer was a nasty customer.
He wanted my body.

331
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:59,447
I want to commit suicide

332
00:28:02,674 --> 00:28:04,877
Can you escape from here?

333
00:28:06,065 --> 00:28:06,901
I can't

334
00:28:08,908 --> 00:28:11,502
They are watching me

335
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,979
You have paid holidays.

336
00:28:15,658 --> 00:28:16,830
In name only.

337
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:24,666
I'd like to escape if you go with me

338
00:28:27,041 --> 00:28:28,408
I go with you?

339
00:28:31,885 --> 00:28:32,776
Ok

340
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:37,916
Are you sure?

341
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:48,994
But we must prepare carefully.

342
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:57,018
With you, I'm okay with anything.
Please take me to escape from here

343
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:05,635
Don't worry, Come in

344
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:07,674
I want to talk with you something

345
00:29:07,699 --> 00:29:11,471
It's an emergency and I'd like you to leave.

346
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:12,182
What's wrong?

347
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:17,354
Our boss's friend caused problems.

348
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,236
We need to send some people

349
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:21,166
Boss asked you to go

350
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:22,377
Asakichi-san

351
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:23,924
I'm sorry

352
00:29:31,627 --> 00:29:37,689
Don't do anything dangerous.
Think of me

353
00:29:38,315 --> 00:29:43,682
Don't worry.
We should think about escaping later

354
00:30:08,494 --> 00:30:09,494
Don't move

355
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:10,588
Thank you

356
00:30:10,971 --> 00:30:11,955
Be careful

357
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:14,276
OK let's go

358
00:30:19,424 --> 00:30:20,705
Can you wait?

359
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:29,033
What are you doing here?

360
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,057
I thought it was the last time I would see you.

361
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:35,213
I'll be OK

362
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:36,369
Don't come here

363
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:39,283
Come here

364
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:45,526
I'm sorry but can you stay here in 2F?

365
00:30:45,588 --> 00:30:47,643
I'll be back soon

366
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,916
Wait!

367
00:30:52,947 --> 00:30:55,072
He is so selfish

368
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:01,955
I don't know what happened, anyway go upstairs

369
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:12,228
It is annoying when people like you come here.

370
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:13,151
I'm sorry

371
00:31:13,322 --> 00:31:14,947
Please go back

372
00:31:15,369 --> 00:31:19,174
I don't want anything to do with that Matsushima gangster.

373
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:30,682
Run away!

374
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:35,361
Go backdoor

375
00:31:46,994 --> 00:31:48,604
What are you doing here?

376
00:31:48,629 --> 00:31:49,861
Help me

377
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,799
I won't make you trouble

378
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:53,557
Please

379
00:31:55,619 --> 00:31:56,635
OK come in

380
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,361
I don't know.
Don't ask me

381
00:32:16,072 --> 00:32:21,611
We'll be here until Asakichi comes back

382
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:35,416
You didn't need to because the Tennoji bosses interceded.

383
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:38,971
I didn't have to fight.

384
00:32:49,111 --> 00:32:50,018
Who are they?

385
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,541
They are Matsushima group.
They say you took a woman from Matsushima group.

386
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,588
What's wrong?

387
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:09,736
Oh Sada

388
00:33:10,495 --> 00:33:13,065
Do you know that Asakichi is with Matsushima's woman?

389
00:33:13,198 --> 00:33:14,760
I don't know

390
00:33:16,471 --> 00:33:18,268
Where is him?

391
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:20,979
I was with him but where he has gone?

392
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:24,948
Did you let him go?

393
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:27,463
No way, I don't know at all

394
00:33:27,791 --> 00:33:32,034
I'll ask him when he return, and We'll send back her to you if no problem

395
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,846
So please wait

396
00:33:40,346 --> 00:33:45,213
Ok I'll count on you, then we are leaving

397
00:33:46,096 --> 00:33:46,846
Let's go

398
00:33:54,830 --> 00:34:00,799
That's true.
Asakichi asked me to hide her

399
00:34:00,995 --> 00:34:04,791
Really?
That's a problem,where is her?

400
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,440
I let her to escape

401
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:10,674
That's a problem.
We want nothing to do with the Matsushima group

402
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:15,830
Oh Asakichi

403
00:34:16,737 --> 00:34:19,182
I was hiding in the neighborhood.

404
00:34:19,207 --> 00:34:22,119
The problem is that you are harboring their women.

405
00:34:22,213 --> 00:34:25,229
You're freaking them out.

406
00:34:25,416 --> 00:34:26,041
What?

407
00:34:26,205 --> 00:34:28,143
Don't fight here

408
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,338
I'll go back to home

409
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:32,705
Thanks

410
00:34:33,174 --> 00:34:35,299
I have done you no favors.

411
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,455
Never mind

412
00:34:55,643 --> 00:34:57,190
This is a parting gift.

413
00:34:57,215 --> 00:35:02,307
Don't worry.
But I'll take this as a today's work fee

414
00:35:02,807 --> 00:35:03,588
Thanks

415
00:35:04,401 --> 00:35:05,323
She is in upstairs?

416
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:06,370
She's in back door

417
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:07,057
Really?

418
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:07,760
Shall we go?

419
00:35:07,948 --> 00:35:09,323
Let's go

420
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,948
Where are you going,Sada?

421
00:35:13,018 --> 00:35:14,049
I'll go to see him off

422
00:35:14,127 --> 00:35:18,729
Watch out them,
It will be in trouble if they find you

423
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,846
I'll talk to them he is my bros

424
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:24,541
Stupid,He has nothing to do with us anymore

425
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:32,213
You told him not to play with women.

426
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:33,002
Of course

427
00:35:33,027 --> 00:35:38,549
I understand Asakichi is no longer with us.
You were pathetic in your flirtation with the Matsushima group.

428
00:35:38,574 --> 00:35:39,409
What?

429
00:35:39,737 --> 00:35:44,666
What do you mean that Mr. Asakichi will give up his woman when he returns?

430
00:35:44,691 --> 00:35:45,729
Of course

431
00:35:46,143 --> 00:35:50,916
You submit to the strong, and I find that
pathetic.

432
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:51,463
Shut up!

433
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:56,409
I am ashamed to be in such a weak group.

434
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,690
You think so?

435
00:35:58,229 --> 00:35:59,627
Do you want to quiet?

436
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:01,354
I want to leave

437
00:36:01,379 --> 00:36:02,979
OK I get it

438
00:36:03,237 --> 00:36:06,127
Thank you for all your help.

439
00:36:10,065 --> 00:36:11,737
Let's go

440
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:15,830
Hey guys, Say good bye to them

441
00:36:16,854 --> 00:36:17,612
Take care

442
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:20,041
You idiot!
Beat him!

443
00:36:20,643 --> 00:36:22,471
Bring it on

444
00:36:22,596 --> 00:36:23,596
Stop it!

445
00:36:29,268 --> 00:36:31,721
I will be back door.
Come if you want to fight with me

446
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:38,088
She's already let her go.

447
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:39,768
Right?

448
00:36:41,416 --> 00:36:42,877
Do you know where she's gone?

449
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:46,494
I don't know but don't worry

450
00:36:46,519 --> 00:36:48,432
I don't worry but

451
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:49,776
Where's your mom?

452
00:36:50,237 --> 00:36:53,784
She went to Koyasan to pay her respects.

453
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,205
She won't come back for a few days

454
00:36:56,323 --> 00:36:57,627
I see

455
00:36:58,112 --> 00:36:59,377
You want to meet her?

456
00:36:59,689 --> 00:37:03,228
It's Ok if she's escaped

457
00:37:04,323 --> 00:37:06,666
But you look down

458
00:37:07,815 --> 00:37:08,784
No way

459
00:37:09,666 --> 00:37:11,385
Anyway sorry for making you trouble

460
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,385
I want to thank you.

461
00:37:17,057 --> 00:37:19,948
Let's have a meal together

462
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:26,267
That's fine.
We work at a meat restaurant

463
00:37:26,729 --> 00:37:29,775
We want you to come to our restaurant

464
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,424
Right?

465
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,533
Yeah

466
00:37:31,713 --> 00:37:34,119
That's convenience.
Let's go

467
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:36,409
I want to eat meat too.
Let's go

468
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,651
May I have your name?

469
00:37:46,683 --> 00:37:48,760
I'm Okinu
I'm Oteru

470
00:37:48,785 --> 00:37:50,846
We are working there

471
00:37:50,871 --> 00:37:52,784
You are so kind

472
00:37:52,809 --> 00:37:55,588
Your mother is kind too

473
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:56,987
She's very different from Yoshioka

474
00:37:57,213 --> 00:37:58,010
Really

475
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:11,838
Are you free now?

476
00:38:14,643 --> 00:38:15,659
Leave it to me

477
00:38:33,994 --> 00:38:35,276
He'll be fine?

478
00:38:35,301 --> 00:38:37,596
Don't worry.
He's strong

479
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,151
Let's wait for him

480
00:38:58,276 --> 00:39:00,104
Yes I know her

481
00:39:00,987 --> 00:39:03,346
But I don't know where she is now

482
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:06,166
I'm not the only her guest

483
00:39:07,416 --> 00:39:10,916
She could have gone out of business voluntarily.

484
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:18,534
I can't play here if she thinks I helped her escape.

485
00:39:19,104 --> 00:39:21,291
Don't say bullshit

486
00:39:26,073 --> 00:39:28,166
I'm Ok if I fight with you

487
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:33,393
But I don't know about her

488
00:39:34,463 --> 00:39:36,354
Don't say bullshit

489
00:39:37,643 --> 00:39:40,596
Drop the sword you're hiding.

490
00:39:41,612 --> 00:39:42,471
What?

491
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:47,315
If you take it, I shoot the pistol

492
00:39:50,104 --> 00:39:53,174
Wait, you have a pistol?

493
00:39:53,455 --> 00:39:54,502
So what?

494
00:39:55,534 --> 00:40:01,034
Because I'm a gangster

495
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:05,159
Ask your boss if you want to use pistol too

496
00:40:05,776 --> 00:40:08,549
I'll wait for you

497
00:40:08,791 --> 00:40:10,713
What's the deal?

498
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:21,072
It's ok if you win.
I will kiss your boss if I win

499
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:29,549
Asakichi

500
00:40:32,534 --> 00:40:36,994
I'll drop my sward, so you drop your pistol too

501
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:40,721
Is that OK with you?

502
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,534
I'm OK

503
00:40:42,948 --> 00:40:44,096
I know you have another sword

504
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:45,432
What?

505
00:40:45,846 --> 00:40:50,010
Your subordinates are around here

506
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,955
They will attack me

507
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:56,111
Then I'll kill you

508
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:57,463
Oh no

509
00:40:57,916 --> 00:40:59,151
You get ready to fight with me

510
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:01,838
OK I get ready

511
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,909
Put your sword down.
I'll take care of it

512
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:29,877
OK let's start

513
00:41:33,877 --> 00:41:35,330
Just bring it on

514
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:37,502
I'll kill you

515
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:42,932
What? that's my sword

516
00:41:43,916 --> 00:41:47,096
This is your sword.
I don't have a pistol

517
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:48,190
You cheated me

518
00:41:48,549 --> 00:41:51,096
I'll kill you

519
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,924
Damn it.
I'll revenge you later

520
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:58,362
He is wanker

521
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:06,346
Thanks for waiting

522
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,815
Please

523
00:42:14,252 --> 00:42:15,909
Enjoy your meal

524
00:42:19,409 --> 00:42:22,877
I want to ask you something

525
00:42:22,902 --> 00:42:24,268
What's wrong?

526
00:42:24,502 --> 00:42:28,573
I want you to be my boss.

527
00:42:29,416 --> 00:42:30,143
Please

528
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:33,034
What are you taking about?
I'm just Yakuza

529
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:35,400
But I need you

530
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,799
Stop asking that

531
00:42:41,151 --> 00:42:47,534
I'm not putting on an act.

532
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,541
Do you want to fight with me?

533
00:42:50,566 --> 00:42:51,698
Stop it

534
00:42:53,596 --> 00:42:54,252
Sada

535
00:42:54,448 --> 00:42:55,393
What?

536
00:42:59,346 --> 00:43:01,088
We are good brother.
That's ok

537
00:43:03,002 --> 00:43:03,494
Right?

538
00:43:11,362 --> 00:43:12,346
Bros

539
00:43:13,948 --> 00:43:15,752
I was surprised.

540
00:43:15,777 --> 00:43:17,510
We were worried

541
00:43:21,643 --> 00:43:24,323
Let's have a friendly drink.

542
00:43:24,348 --> 00:43:25,174
Bring sake

543
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:26,409
I will

544
00:43:26,434 --> 00:43:28,112
I will serve you

545
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:37,291
You are lucky to have a confidant.

546
00:43:38,112 --> 00:43:39,432
He's good man too

547
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:42,510
He's a compassionate man.

548
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:43,518
No way

549
00:43:43,768 --> 00:43:45,057
I'm just being good-natured.

550
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:47,635
Thanks for waiting

551
00:43:49,268 --> 00:43:51,744
Please wait until the food is ready.

552
00:43:53,627 --> 00:43:54,830
Here it is

553
00:43:55,487 --> 00:43:56,190
Please

554
00:43:56,215 --> 00:43:56,909
I can't drink

555
00:43:57,018 --> 00:43:57,963
Really?

556
00:43:58,877 --> 00:44:00,987
I'll drink little

557
00:44:02,705 --> 00:44:03,448
Thanks

558
00:44:04,065 --> 00:44:04,862
Bros

559
00:44:06,174 --> 00:44:08,346
Let's make a toast to her.

560
00:44:10,276 --> 00:44:11,619
We pray for her safe

561
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,612
They are so nice, aren't they?

562
00:44:16,244 --> 00:44:18,815
Don't flatter me.

563
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,073
I like you

564
00:44:20,987 --> 00:44:22,502
That's good for me

565
00:44:22,527 --> 00:44:23,737
I know you like me too

566
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:24,987
She forces me

567
00:44:25,012 --> 00:44:26,315
I won't serve you if you don't like me

568
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:28,362
I love you so much

569
00:44:28,387 --> 00:44:29,471
I'm glad

570
00:44:33,526 --> 00:44:36,948
Shall we get drunk tonight and stay somewhere
else?

571
00:44:37,127 --> 00:44:39,237
That's good. Let's go

572
00:44:39,682 --> 00:44:42,846
I've never stayed out before

573
00:44:43,143 --> 00:44:44,815
Don't worry

574
00:44:45,244 --> 00:44:46,666
It's bad

575
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:50,049
We can go without you

576
00:44:50,369 --> 00:44:51,190
OK?

577
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:52,838
Go ahead

578
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,276
Thank you very much

579
00:45:16,003 --> 00:45:19,174
What's wrong with Okinu?

580
00:45:19,253 --> 00:45:20,432
I don't care

581
00:45:22,401 --> 00:45:24,667
Oh, she is in the car

582
00:45:24,901 --> 00:45:25,776
Really

583
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:37,846
You are pathetic to be crossed by your own henchmen.
I am so frustrated I can't sleep.

584
00:45:41,159 --> 00:45:45,065
I don't accept what comes, but what goes, goes.

585
00:45:45,362 --> 00:45:49,346
Your thinking is very naive.

586
00:45:49,526 --> 00:45:51,518
So many housemates come to stay for free.

587
00:45:54,581 --> 00:45:55,604
What?

588
00:45:59,253 --> 00:46:00,018
Yoshioka!

589
00:46:05,377 --> 00:46:06,963
Stop it!

590
00:46:08,776 --> 00:46:09,877
Punching in!

591
00:46:11,448 --> 00:46:12,909
Stop it!

592
00:46:13,682 --> 00:46:15,963
I don't feel like facing you

593
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:18,253
I cut myself off from those men.

594
00:46:19,753 --> 00:46:20,487
Stop it!

595
00:46:23,338 --> 00:46:24,370
Help me!

596
00:46:39,737 --> 00:46:42,995
I'm the first to take a bath with a man

597
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:44,174
I see

598
00:46:44,463 --> 00:46:48,198
You think I'm easy?

599
00:46:48,612 --> 00:46:49,940
You look happy

600
00:46:49,987 --> 00:46:51,346
Yes

601
00:46:54,557 --> 00:46:57,776
Your friend is dating Sada

602
00:46:57,948 --> 00:46:59,378
It might be so

603
00:47:00,253 --> 00:47:01,400
What happened with us?

604
00:47:01,425 --> 00:47:02,987
Nothing happened

605
00:47:03,776 --> 00:47:04,932
Why you've come here?

606
00:47:04,957 --> 00:47:06,520
I just wanted to come

607
00:47:07,221 --> 00:47:07,948
I know but

608
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:12,221
They are now couple, I don't know what happened with us

609
00:47:13,557 --> 00:47:16,706
You have a woman who name is Kotoito

610
00:47:17,495 --> 00:47:19,745
I just play with her

611
00:47:20,292 --> 00:47:24,229
You just play with her.
You're crossing a dangerous bridge.

612
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,034
You are helping her escape

613
00:47:26,924 --> 00:47:29,010
Why I can't help her escape?

614
00:47:29,901 --> 00:47:31,120
Yes but...

615
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:40,995
If you marry me, you'll have a hard time.

616
00:47:41,245 --> 00:47:42,135
I don't worry

617
00:47:42,971 --> 00:47:45,635
I am traveling all over Japan

618
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,901
I don't know where I'm going to get killed.

619
00:47:49,596 --> 00:47:51,870
So I want to be with you.

620
00:47:52,917 --> 00:47:59,221
My ex-husband was like you

621
00:48:00,455 --> 00:48:01,635
I like to struggle.

622
00:48:03,721 --> 00:48:05,635
What if you have a baby?

623
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:08,510
I'll take care of him

624
00:48:11,245 --> 00:48:12,690
You are funny

625
00:48:19,698 --> 00:48:22,690
Oh my god, Sister!

626
00:48:24,878 --> 00:48:26,354
Stop it

627
00:48:28,838 --> 00:48:29,806
You don't like me?

628
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:31,714
I like you

629
00:48:32,339 --> 00:48:33,260
So it's ok

630
00:48:36,588 --> 00:48:39,339
I need you to write a pledge.

631
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:42,659
Write a pledge?

632
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:58,346
Please write that I will take care of you for the rest of my life

633
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:01,214
You make it sound as if I owe you money.

634
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,088
It's piece of cake

635
00:49:20,610 --> 00:49:22,033
I can talk to your mother in the meantime

636
00:49:24,385 --> 00:49:25,135
Is this OK?

637
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:31,182
Ouch

638
00:49:31,714 --> 00:49:32,737
Oh no

639
00:50:05,651 --> 00:50:08,729
I don't know where to go

640
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:11,706
I'll trust you, so Don't worry

641
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:27,682
Let's play

642
00:50:29,346 --> 00:50:30,464
How are you?

643
00:50:31,846 --> 00:50:33,831
You look nice

644
00:50:34,619 --> 00:50:37,181
I have made my dream come true

645
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,753
You gave your virginity to a good man.

646
00:50:39,901 --> 00:50:40,932
I'm shy

647
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:43,181
Congratulations

648
00:50:43,244 --> 00:50:43,970
Shall I help you?

649
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:45,447
Well...

650
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:47,666
Don't be shy

651
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:53,994
Seriously,Will you go home after eating?

652
00:50:54,291 --> 00:50:55,314
I see

653
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:57,361
Then come back later

654
00:50:59,478 --> 00:51:00,095
Please

655
00:51:02,009 --> 00:51:02,939
Take care

656
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:04,463
Thank you

657
00:51:11,088 --> 00:51:11,666
Damn it

658
00:51:11,853 --> 00:51:12,642
Thanks

659
00:51:13,283 --> 00:51:14,127
Oh

660
00:51:15,361 --> 00:51:16,884
Damn it

661
00:51:17,744 --> 00:51:19,127
I have bad luck

662
00:51:19,299 --> 00:51:20,822
Thanks

663
00:51:20,847 --> 00:51:21,424
You won

664
00:51:21,502 --> 00:51:22,009
I won

665
00:51:22,158 --> 00:51:22,619
I see

666
00:51:23,259 --> 00:51:25,314
I'll stop

667
00:51:27,955 --> 00:51:29,197
You are strong

668
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:32,759
You can cheat

669
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:34,775
No. I don't like cheating

670
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,431
There is no loss in deceit.

671
00:51:36,681 --> 00:51:38,416
Sada, by the way

672
00:51:39,517 --> 00:51:41,963
They haven't come back for four days

673
00:51:43,384 --> 00:51:47,080
I wonder if they had any problems

674
00:51:47,252 --> 00:51:48,689
I start to worry

675
00:51:49,369 --> 00:51:51,627
Alcohol is running out

676
00:51:57,978 --> 00:51:59,447
Oh they have come back

677
00:51:59,502 --> 00:52:00,017
Really?

678
00:52:06,002 --> 00:52:07,924
What happened?

679
00:52:07,994 --> 00:52:09,470
There is a big problem

680
00:52:09,495 --> 00:52:09,947
What?

681
00:52:09,972 --> 00:52:13,502
The boss of the Yoshioka group was attacked by the Matsushima group

682
00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:15,963
It serves him right.
It's his fault

683
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:19,345
This was the original problem.

684
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:21,705
I'll attack them in return

685
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:24,759
No.
They are looking for you

686
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:27,338
It's Ok.
I get into them

687
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:30,845
But, Kotoito has been captured by them

688
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,978
Oh my god

689
00:52:33,494 --> 00:52:38,767
She was captured by the Matsushima clan when she visited the Yoshioka clan out of concern for you.

690
00:52:40,197 --> 00:52:42,986
I got this letter from her

691
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:50,189
She in Inushima

692
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:51,377
Inushima?

693
00:52:53,244 --> 00:52:54,705
She is on Inushima in the Seto Inland Sea

694
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:04,681
I go. Okinu

695
00:53:04,986 --> 00:53:07,783
I know.
You worry about her

696
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:11,869
But don't push yourself too hard

697
00:53:12,947 --> 00:53:15,134
I worry about you

698
00:53:17,345 --> 00:53:19,548
Please go with me,Sada

699
00:53:20,048 --> 00:53:20,830
You'll be fine?

700
00:53:20,861 --> 00:53:23,790
Don't worry.
This is my job

701
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:31,158
What's wrong, bros

702
00:53:32,361 --> 00:53:34,291
You'll miss her?

703
00:53:35,822 --> 00:53:37,728
No way

704
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:39,830
Money

705
00:53:40,416 --> 00:53:41,041
Money?

706
00:53:42,283 --> 00:53:42,916
For what?

707
00:53:44,033 --> 00:53:48,057
If we go to Inushima, We have to prepare money

708
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,072
Why?

709
00:53:49,721 --> 00:53:56,174
If something happens, we can solve it with money

710
00:53:56,557 --> 00:53:57,861
Oh right

711
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,174
What to do if they ask for money?

712
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:06,854
We can't say we have no money

713
00:54:07,127 --> 00:54:11,424
I see, but How shall we prepare the money?

714
00:54:14,244 --> 00:54:16,439
I'll go to Arima

715
00:54:17,049 --> 00:54:18,299
That's where you eloped.

716
00:54:20,025 --> 00:54:21,939
She has nothing to do this me

717
00:54:23,705 --> 00:54:26,268
Tell her parents why.

718
00:54:28,658 --> 00:54:30,596
I think they will lend me money

719
00:54:36,658 --> 00:54:38,682
She is here now?

720
00:54:40,572 --> 00:54:41,791
She's in upstairs

721
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:43,619
I see

722
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:49,291
Oh you come back

723
00:54:56,541 --> 00:55:00,001
No no.. I have a favor of you

724
00:55:00,432 --> 00:55:03,525
The man below said you are upstairs

725
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,463
I see what you mean.

726
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:09,182
You look fine

727
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,518
Because you left me

728
00:55:13,471 --> 00:55:14,783
It seems you are rich

729
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:17,596
I can lend you money.

730
00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:19,822
What do you spend the money on?

731
00:55:20,455 --> 00:55:23,682
I'm trying to help a man

732
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:28,525
A woman, right?

733
00:55:35,197 --> 00:55:36,299
Is that right?

734
00:55:36,861 --> 00:55:40,729
If you speak honestly, I'll lend you some money

735
00:55:42,299 --> 00:55:43,346
You win

736
00:55:44,736 --> 00:55:46,908
To be honest,
I'm trying to help a woman

737
00:55:48,236 --> 00:55:49,111
She was sold

738
00:55:49,408 --> 00:55:50,736
That's what I thought

739
00:55:57,822 --> 00:55:58,627
What's this?

740
00:55:59,697 --> 00:56:01,127
How did you get this?

741
00:56:02,049 --> 00:56:03,549
I'm just taking care of it

742
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:10,729
I understand your situation.
But I don't have a lot of money

743
00:56:13,432 --> 00:56:14,322
So...

744
00:56:16,408 --> 00:56:19,893
Would you like to do something dangerous?

745
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:23,143
I'll do anything

746
00:56:23,604 --> 00:56:24,471
What will we do?

747
00:56:24,721 --> 00:56:31,275
There will be a gambling party in Kobe tomorrow.
I will tell you what the customer is doing

748
00:56:32,221 --> 00:56:33,111
Cheating?

749
00:56:33,783 --> 00:56:37,033
It's the easiest way to make a lot of money

750
00:56:37,752 --> 00:56:39,627
I don't like cheating

751
00:56:40,557 --> 00:56:42,072
What if they found me?

752
00:56:42,252 --> 00:56:46,939
Leave it to me.
You just have to trust me

753
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:52,338
I have a friend of mine.
Can we go together?

754
00:56:53,596 --> 00:56:54,158
Thanks

755
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,260
Wait.
Are you going back now?

756
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,744
You have to kiss me at least

757
00:57:11,338 --> 00:57:13,338
I didn't expect

758
00:57:25,307 --> 00:57:26,557
Ready

759
00:57:26,916 --> 00:57:27,916
Play

760
00:59:08,930 --> 00:59:12,274
It was so nice.
We made it

761
00:59:12,572 --> 00:59:15,010
I'm glad it worked really well

762
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:19,322
Now we have military funds
Let's get in!

763
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:31,354
Can we get back on this ship again?

764
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:34,064
Let's go

765
00:59:43,174 --> 00:59:44,627
Hey guys

766
00:59:45,455 --> 00:59:47,720
You guys came here looking for a job?

767
00:59:47,745 --> 00:59:49,197
Yes we do

768
00:59:49,705 --> 00:59:50,557
Where are you staying?

769
00:59:50,582 --> 00:59:52,744
Would you guys be willing to accommodate us?

770
00:59:54,064 --> 00:59:55,947
The inn called Tokaiya is good

771
00:59:56,744 --> 00:59:58,720
Tokaiya?
How they spell?

772
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:00,744
Write across the rhyme

773
01:00:01,642 --> 01:00:02,658
Shall we stay there?

774
01:00:03,229 --> 01:00:04,713
Thank you

775
01:00:13,064 --> 01:00:13,838
Here it is

776
01:00:16,049 --> 01:00:19,275
This inn is a good name

777
01:00:19,439 --> 01:00:20,814
How many days do you stay?

778
01:00:21,275 --> 01:00:23,518
4,5 days.
We'll stay more if we like

779
01:00:24,767 --> 01:00:27,173
You'll take care of us?

780
01:00:27,198 --> 01:00:28,369
You don't like me?

781
01:00:28,394 --> 01:00:29,298
No way

782
01:00:29,323 --> 01:00:31,400
I like you.
May I have your name?

783
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:33,775
Oshige, I'll put your tea here

784
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:36,877
Oshige-san.
Can I play with you?

785
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:38,807
Please leave if you want to play with me

786
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:40,135
She reject him

787
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:43,518
You can go to the bar if you want to play women

788
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,619
Thanks for your information

789
01:00:45,979 --> 01:00:48,096
Let's have a bath

790
01:01:01,424 --> 01:01:02,963
Please come

791
01:01:04,229 --> 01:01:05,627
Come in

792
01:01:06,041 --> 01:01:07,971
We’ll come here later

793
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:09,064
Come in

794
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:11,275
There are nice girls

795
01:01:13,518 --> 01:01:15,057
Come to our bar

796
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,721
We’ll come here later

797
01:01:22,314 --> 01:01:23,955
There are nice girls?

798
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,978
Yes. please come in

799
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:48,768
We’ll come here later

800
01:01:52,682 --> 01:01:53,760
She's here

801
01:01:54,096 --> 01:01:55,674
That's what we thought

802
01:02:13,588 --> 01:02:15,002
What's wrong with you?

803
01:02:16,924 --> 01:02:19,900
This is an island

804
01:02:21,096 --> 01:02:22,416
I know that

805
01:02:23,205 --> 01:02:24,354
How can we escape from here?

806
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:25,924
Of course, we take a boat

807
01:02:26,947 --> 01:02:28,268
How can we get the boat?

808
01:02:28,455 --> 01:02:31,236
I see.
we need to hire someone who can help us

809
01:02:32,182 --> 01:02:35,424
If we get caught, we can't escape

810
01:02:37,572 --> 01:02:40,533
We wish we could hide 3 days in this island

811
01:02:41,393 --> 01:02:42,846
I was thinking the same

812
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:48,095
I searched various ways

813
01:02:49,346 --> 01:02:53,376
I keep forgetting that this island is under their watch.

814
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:55,916
I'm not sure about the yakuza here

815
01:02:56,596 --> 01:03:01,807
They may kill us and sink in this sea

816
01:03:06,158 --> 01:03:09,510
Oh what's wrong?
You look unhappy

817
01:03:13,416 --> 01:03:16,486
I want to ask you something

818
01:03:17,135 --> 01:03:18,986
What? tell me

819
01:03:19,518 --> 01:03:21,744
Who is the boss of this place?

820
01:03:21,932 --> 01:03:23,025
He is a Silk hat person

821
01:03:23,588 --> 01:03:25,244
Silk hat?
What's the hell?

822
01:03:25,971 --> 01:03:33,314
He ran away from his old gambling debts to this island wearing a silk hat.

823
01:03:34,713 --> 01:03:35,807
That's funny

824
01:03:35,832 --> 01:03:42,096
He's opened this inn.
He still comes here wearing a silk  hat

825
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,361
Are you local?

826
01:03:46,369 --> 01:03:48,729
I was born and raised here

827
01:03:49,135 --> 01:03:50,213
Really?

828
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:55,627
Do you feel a sense of duty to your boss?

829
01:03:56,369 --> 01:03:57,025
No

830
01:03:58,127 --> 01:03:59,299
Be honest

831
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:04,540
For example ,That you owe him money.

832
01:04:05,861 --> 01:04:09,900
No.. but why you ask me?

833
01:04:18,986 --> 01:04:21,752
Why you' turned so serious?

834
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:23,838
You do her a favor.

835
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:25,494
Me too?

836
01:04:26,494 --> 01:04:27,853
What's wrong?

837
01:04:27,878 --> 01:04:28,619
Seriously

838
01:04:30,025 --> 01:04:33,002
We need your help.
Please

839
01:04:33,947 --> 01:04:34,682
Please

840
01:04:40,845 --> 01:04:43,220
I heard about you from Oshige

841
01:04:44,306 --> 01:04:46,619
You are local in this island

842
01:04:48,494 --> 01:04:49,744
I have a favor of you

843
01:04:54,892 --> 01:04:55,892
To be honest

844
01:04:57,080 --> 01:05:01,392
We'll try to rescue a woman

845
01:05:02,877 --> 01:05:04,845
Will you prepare a boat for us?

846
01:05:07,173 --> 01:05:12,400
It's very hard if you let the yakuza woman escape

847
01:05:12,478 --> 01:05:13,150
I know

848
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:19,595
They already know where you are going to escape

849
01:05:20,510 --> 01:05:21,220
So

850
01:05:21,619 --> 01:05:25,962
The best way is to trick them into going through the easiest channel.

851
01:05:25,987 --> 01:05:26,783
So please

852
01:05:27,338 --> 01:05:28,681
This is money for it

853
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,189
It's not a matter of money.

854
01:05:46,205 --> 01:05:48,142
Oh you are awake

855
01:05:48,167 --> 01:05:49,494
Because I worry about you

856
01:05:50,197 --> 01:05:50,775
How was it?

857
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:54,681
I asked him and he said he will help us.

858
01:05:55,299 --> 01:05:56,447
That's good for you

859
01:05:57,064 --> 01:06:00,705
He's being treated badly by that man in the silk hat.

860
01:06:01,189 --> 01:06:02,306
Oh I see

861
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:08,174
Anyway, our plan was successful

862
01:06:09,806 --> 01:06:14,095
It's a little inconvenient for the two of us together.

863
01:06:14,697 --> 01:06:17,322
I'd like to stay at a different inn just for me.

864
01:06:18,564 --> 01:06:19,736
Do you know the inn?

865
01:06:20,103 --> 01:06:21,619
There is a inn called Asaoka near  here

866
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:22,275
Really?

867
01:06:22,713 --> 01:06:26,939
It's an inn run by the master of the boatyard.

868
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:29,431
There are many bosses here

869
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,924
He is the boss who manages the boarding

870
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:38,299
Ok, I'll manage it

871
01:06:38,877 --> 01:06:42,111
Can you work with Sada that we planned?

872
01:06:42,136 --> 01:06:43,181
I'm counting on you

873
01:06:43,206 --> 01:06:44,322
Leave it to me

874
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:02,838
Hi

875
01:07:03,697 --> 01:07:05,470
Is this photo the same as a real person?

876
01:07:05,509 --> 01:07:07,978
Yes,They are real

877
01:07:08,189 --> 01:07:10,814
They are more beautiful in the real thing than in the photo

878
01:07:10,839 --> 01:07:12,384
Ok, then I'll play

879
01:07:12,564 --> 01:07:13,806
Please come in

880
01:07:16,728 --> 01:07:19,892
Come here, Kotoito

881
01:07:24,236 --> 01:07:26,377
Thanks for waiting

882
01:07:33,845 --> 01:07:36,385
Is it sure that the person you chose is this woman?

883
01:07:36,410 --> 01:07:39,525
Yes,she's more beautiful in the real thing than in the photo

884
01:07:39,697 --> 01:07:41,017
That's true

885
01:07:41,431 --> 01:07:42,908
Please come in the room

886
01:07:43,189 --> 01:07:44,517
I'm fine to talk with her here

887
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,931
You won't stay?

888
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,424
I'll come here again

889
01:07:47,449 --> 01:07:48,377
Don't worry

890
01:07:49,056 --> 01:07:51,760
This money is for you

891
01:07:52,299 --> 01:07:53,400
Thanks

892
01:07:53,425 --> 01:07:54,627
Bring me beers

893
01:07:54,885 --> 01:07:55,689
Yes sir

894
01:07:56,252 --> 01:07:59,674
Please fill this out later

895
01:07:59,699 --> 01:08:01,752
The police are strict

896
01:08:01,777 --> 01:08:02,595
I get it

897
01:08:10,439 --> 01:08:13,119
Kotoito,
You look fine

898
01:08:14,205 --> 01:08:15,884
How you know I'm here?

899
01:08:15,909 --> 01:08:17,791
Your mom wrote us

900
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:20,213
Thanks for coming

901
01:08:20,238 --> 01:08:23,353
ASAKICHI and I will definitely help you

902
01:08:26,213 --> 01:08:28,103
Thank you for taking care of me

903
01:08:31,736 --> 01:08:36,119
It ’s very difficult to get out of here

904
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,697
You must not be weak.

905
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:44,423
Mr. Asakichi is planning well.
So cheer up

906
01:08:45,002 --> 01:08:45,556
Yes

907
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:49,369
Can we go out?

908
01:08:51,056 --> 01:08:52,252
It's hard

909
01:08:53,486 --> 01:08:55,814
I see. it's hard

910
01:08:57,431 --> 01:09:00,994
There is a festival every month

911
01:09:01,205 --> 01:09:02,049
When is it?

912
01:09:03,517 --> 01:09:04,338
Day after tomorrow

913
01:09:35,642 --> 01:09:36,845
Hi

914
01:09:37,986 --> 01:09:41,158
You got nice woman

915
01:09:41,431 --> 01:09:42,791
Don't show off

916
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:44,181
I'm sorry

917
01:11:00,056 --> 01:11:01,869
Hurry up!

918
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,025
Thanks for coming

919
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:09,720
We'll talk later.
Hurry up!

920
01:11:25,955 --> 01:11:26,760
Hi

921
01:11:30,486 --> 01:11:32,291
What shall we do?

922
01:11:33,697 --> 01:11:35,072
What's wrong?

923
01:11:35,135 --> 01:11:38,939
I hurt my leg at work.

924
01:11:42,767 --> 01:11:44,049
Oh my god

925
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:47,642
Don't worry

926
01:11:48,494 --> 01:11:49,119
Where is the boat?

927
01:11:49,431 --> 01:11:50,689
We have prepared

928
01:11:51,111 --> 01:11:53,822
Shall I try to drive?

929
01:11:53,847 --> 01:11:54,603
Yes

930
01:11:54,666 --> 01:11:55,400
Is she fine?

931
01:11:55,533 --> 01:11:57,166
It's better than you drive

932
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:01,791
Oh you

933
01:12:24,095 --> 01:12:25,486
Where are we going?

934
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:29,002
Go to another island and then run away

935
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:35,079
Where is she gone?

936
01:12:36,056 --> 01:12:37,486
She's escaped

937
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:42,088
Ask the silk hat masters to check the port immediately.

938
01:12:42,113 --> 01:12:43,666
OK

939
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:50,174
What happened?

940
01:12:50,306 --> 01:12:53,571
Now is the time for the tide to flow in the opposite direction

941
01:12:54,127 --> 01:12:55,627
So where are we now?

942
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:00,142
Habuya...This is where we were

943
01:13:03,791 --> 01:13:05,385
Let's go up the hill once.

944
01:13:06,103 --> 01:13:07,416
Please, take the boat.

945
01:13:08,377 --> 01:13:11,291
We have no choice but to hide.

946
01:13:22,244 --> 01:13:24,455
I did my best

947
01:13:24,502 --> 01:13:26,517
I know,
thanks

948
01:13:26,837 --> 01:13:29,197
Watch out your step

949
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:31,783
Hurry up

950
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:41,743
You run away,
Leave it to me the rest

951
01:13:41,768 --> 01:13:42,673
I'm counting on you

952
01:13:42,698 --> 01:13:43,431
Let's go

953
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:58,128
I'll go back

954
01:14:00,971 --> 01:14:03,737
I'm just annoying you

955
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,292
What?

956
01:14:06,815 --> 01:14:10,182
We are in trouble because we want to help you

957
01:14:12,831 --> 01:14:14,096
It can't be helped

958
01:14:16,307 --> 01:14:21,768
Tomorrow you can take a regular boat from the harbor.

959
01:14:23,761 --> 01:14:26,784
They kill us or we kill them.
There are 2 ways

960
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:40,370
Welcome back

961
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:41,041
I'm back

962
01:14:41,066 --> 01:14:41,823
Hey

963
01:14:42,495 --> 01:14:43,300
What?

964
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:45,151
Where is the woman?

965
01:14:45,448 --> 01:14:48,815
I was separated from her on the way,right?

966
01:14:49,464 --> 01:14:50,042
Yes

967
01:14:52,925 --> 01:14:54,339
You were with a man

968
01:14:54,364 --> 01:14:57,378
He didn't like this inn and went another inn

969
01:14:58,214 --> 01:14:59,667
May I come in?

970
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:03,596
There is a person in Asaoka who looks like him

971
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:16,409
Can you take us to there?

972
01:15:27,331 --> 01:15:29,112
What can I do for you?

973
01:15:38,042 --> 01:15:39,151
Give us the woman

974
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:44,221
I can't give her to you guys for free.

975
01:15:44,925 --> 01:15:47,878
If you don't give her, you'll be killed

976
01:15:50,026 --> 01:15:54,386
What the hell you are talking about?
I can shoot you

977
01:15:57,042 --> 01:15:57,784
Pistol?

978
01:15:58,471 --> 01:16:00,401
What's the deal?

979
01:16:01,550 --> 01:16:04,940
Who wants to die first?
You?

980
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:18,659
Can you pass us her?

981
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:21,636
We can't

982
01:16:23,026 --> 01:16:27,557
You guys are still young, but you do wasteful things

983
01:16:28,628 --> 01:16:32,065
It would be in your best interest if you guys gave her to us.

984
01:16:32,807 --> 01:16:33,815
I see

985
01:16:34,573 --> 01:16:36,768
She is willing to quit her job

986
01:16:37,534 --> 01:16:39,667
I does not mean that I won't permit

987
01:16:41,096 --> 01:16:45,675
Once she's back home, she has to go through the formal retirement process.

988
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:46,901
She can't

989
01:16:48,432 --> 01:16:52,276
I will go to the police with her tomorrow morning

990
01:16:53,878 --> 01:16:55,417
So you go home

991
01:16:56,815 --> 01:17:00,261
That would ruin my face.

992
01:17:01,721 --> 01:17:02,581
You understand?

993
01:17:03,815 --> 01:17:07,268
If you don't give her to me, I will force you to take her back.

994
01:17:08,689 --> 01:17:12,268
If you move I will shoot you

995
01:18:17,487 --> 01:18:18,393
Boss

996
01:18:24,987 --> 01:18:32,378
If you knew I was the proprietor of this inn, you are being very disrespectful.

997
01:18:33,495 --> 01:18:37,378
S..Sorry, boss

998
01:18:41,440 --> 01:18:47,643
He is our customer in any case

999
01:18:48,448 --> 01:18:50,753
Sorry to inconvenience you.

1000
01:18:51,753 --> 01:18:53,487
Let me make an excuse

1001
01:18:53,512 --> 01:18:54,565
Give an excuse later

1002
01:18:55,479 --> 01:18:57,205
Anyway leave it to me

1003
01:19:02,901 --> 01:19:05,917
What do you think?

1004
01:19:09,089 --> 01:19:13,104
silk hat-san, don't you complain?

1005
01:19:16,456 --> 01:19:18,057
Leave it to you

1006
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:23,175
I also put my pistol away

1007
01:19:24,714 --> 01:19:26,315
Thank you very much

1008
01:19:27,065 --> 01:19:29,604
Let's go to the room

1009
01:19:41,518 --> 01:19:44,065
I was surprised when she came out

1010
01:19:44,401 --> 01:19:48,479
I was surprised you had a real pistol

1011
01:20:27,495 --> 01:20:28,987
Congratulations

1012
01:20:33,307 --> 01:20:37,190
Let's celebrate it everyone

1013
01:20:43,909 --> 01:20:45,057
Congratulations

1014
01:20:48,987 --> 01:20:53,604
Are you going back to Osaka,Asakichi?

1015
01:20:55,698 --> 01:20:57,268
I have a favor of you

1016
01:20:58,276 --> 01:21:02,010
I want to send her to Anjoya then
I want to make her a normal woman.

1017
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:04,020
That's a problem

1018
01:21:05,245 --> 01:21:09,737
I am the person responsible for her

1019
01:21:11,010 --> 01:21:13,792
I decide her destination

1020
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:20,885
I think you are lover

1021
01:21:21,409 --> 01:21:22,542
Well...

1022
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,229
Don't make excuses

1023
01:21:25,346 --> 01:21:26,206
Let's do this

1024
01:21:27,057 --> 01:21:28,713
Give you a week's vacation

1025
01:21:29,721 --> 01:21:34,128
And you guys do some sightseeing and come back.

1026
01:21:34,909 --> 01:21:35,932
Yes

1027
01:21:36,526 --> 01:21:37,495
Promise me

1028
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:40,948
Don't break our promise

1029
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:48,870
I'm different from that silk hat man

1030
01:21:50,682 --> 01:21:52,628
I have 2,000 henchmen.

1031
01:22:04,206 --> 01:22:08,089
Bros,Why do you return her to Inushima?

1032
01:22:08,542 --> 01:22:10,182
You should never go there again

1033
01:22:12,206 --> 01:22:13,534
Let's escape

1034
01:22:15,596 --> 01:22:16,135
Let's escape

1035
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:27,635
Think carefully during the week and decide.

1036
01:22:43,948 --> 01:22:47,245
I'm so relieved you guys are okay.

1037
01:22:50,229 --> 01:22:52,096
Is she the Kotoito?

1038
01:22:52,831 --> 01:22:53,550
Yes she is

1039
01:22:54,885 --> 01:22:56,714
Nice to meet you

1040
01:22:59,096 --> 01:23:02,253
I'm his wife, Okinu

1041
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:09,690
She is the daughter of the house behind Yoshioka

1042
01:23:11,081 --> 01:23:12,339
I see

1043
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:20,870
I'm glad you were safe.
I'm sure your mother will be happy

1044
01:23:26,135 --> 01:23:28,378
OK, everything is settle down

1045
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:31,635
Can I go out with her?

1046
01:23:31,660 --> 01:23:32,424
OK

1047
01:23:32,503 --> 01:23:35,135
OK, so see you then

1048
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:39,229
Cheer up,Kotoito

1049
01:23:40,026 --> 01:23:41,229
Thank you

1050
01:23:41,737 --> 01:23:44,917
Ok, Let's go

1051
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,612
I'll see them off

1052
01:23:55,651 --> 01:23:57,628
What's wrong?

1053
01:23:59,557 --> 01:24:02,721
I didn't know you have a wife

1054
01:24:04,917 --> 01:24:09,339
I don't know why I went through all that trouble to escape.

1055
01:24:34,737 --> 01:24:38,159
I'll go back to Inushima

1056
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:41,862
You don't have to go back

1057
01:24:43,003 --> 01:24:44,557
But...

1058
01:24:48,260 --> 01:24:49,815
How about going yo Tokyo?

1059
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:52,252
That's good for you

1060
01:24:56,854 --> 01:24:59,932
I will speak to the Inushima boss with my reasons.

1061
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,659
Before that, let's go sightseeing in Nara and Kyoto

1062
01:25:06,331 --> 01:25:09,292
You've never been to Kyoto, right?

1063
01:25:12,893 --> 01:25:16,198
Do you guys go to Kyoto and Nara?

1064
01:25:16,620 --> 01:25:19,174
Enjoy your trip

1065
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:22,042
Did you hear?
Let's go together

1066
01:25:22,067 --> 01:25:24,089
I'm OK

1067
01:25:24,432 --> 01:25:24,995
Let's go

1068
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,354
Thank you,Asakichi

1069
01:25:50,425 --> 01:25:52,784
I decided to go to Tokyo

1070
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,284
That's good for you

1071
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,823
Is everything okay with Inushima?

1072
01:25:58,089 --> 01:25:59,370
Don't worry about that

1073
01:26:00,847 --> 01:26:02,628
You can go to Tokyo from here

1074
01:26:04,018 --> 01:26:06,339
Can you take her to the station?

1075
01:26:06,364 --> 01:26:07,034
Sure

1076
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:19,612
I'll go to Inushima

1077
01:26:25,175 --> 01:26:26,292
I see

1078
01:26:40,886 --> 01:26:41,675
Kotoito

1079
01:26:44,003 --> 01:26:45,729
Be happy

1080
01:26:47,925 --> 01:26:50,237
Please do your best

1081
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,831
You too,Asakichi-san

1082
01:27:06,886 --> 01:27:08,503
I'm going

1083
01:27:25,753 --> 01:27:28,018
It's rare to find someone as wonderful as he is.

1084
01:27:29,925 --> 01:27:31,745
Please take care of him well

1085
01:27:33,018 --> 01:27:34,362
I will

1086
01:27:37,128 --> 01:27:40,964
You are a good match for him.

1087
01:28:07,284 --> 01:28:08,979
You made different promises.

1088
01:28:10,073 --> 01:28:10,854
I'm sorry

1089
01:28:14,956 --> 01:28:18,487
We must keep our promise

1090
01:28:19,190 --> 01:28:19,659
Yes

1091
01:28:19,987 --> 01:28:20,933
Yes?

1092
01:28:25,612 --> 01:28:29,198
You are going to rebel against me?

1093
01:28:29,323 --> 01:28:30,214
No way

1094
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,495
I don't mean that

1095
01:28:33,151 --> 01:28:34,190
To be honest

1096
01:28:34,823 --> 01:28:36,136
I came here to get permission from you

1097
01:28:36,331 --> 01:28:37,253
Shut up

1098
01:28:38,729 --> 01:28:40,550
You look down me

1099
01:28:40,628 --> 01:28:41,589
I don't mean that

1100
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:43,143
Don't make excuses

1101
01:28:45,331 --> 01:28:50,386
Do you know what happens if you go against me?

1102
01:28:51,433 --> 01:28:53,753
Go out with me

1103
01:28:55,104 --> 01:28:56,034
Come

1104
01:29:21,933 --> 01:29:22,690
Stay there

1105
01:29:24,261 --> 01:29:26,089
I will punish you.

1106
01:29:27,722 --> 01:29:28,300
You get it?

1107
01:29:29,167 --> 01:29:29,745
Sure

1108
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:34,362
Please punish me

1109
01:29:34,737 --> 01:29:37,558
Good. I'll start

1110
01:29:39,565 --> 01:29:44,886
You are stupid.
Why you come back?

1111
01:29:59,854 --> 01:30:01,292
Say Give up

1112
01:30:05,589 --> 01:30:06,909
Say Give up

1113
01:30:10,987 --> 01:30:14,393
I won't say it

1114
01:30:14,418 --> 01:30:15,956
So what?

1115
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:24,765
You are right or I am right, I am asking my body.

1116
01:30:25,265 --> 01:30:27,586
You bastard

1117
01:30:33,054 --> 01:30:33,922
You bastard

1118
01:30:43,273 --> 01:30:48,953
Let's play to see if you're right or I'm right.

1119
01:30:52,695 --> 01:30:53,718
Don't say bullshit

1120
01:30:55,578 --> 01:30:58,164
I will not give up even if I die

1121
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,351
I lost

1122
01:31:37,476 --> 01:31:39,242
You'll be good man

1123
01:31:42,882 --> 01:31:44,601
Your name will be popular

1124
01:31:47,093 --> 01:31:52,609
I'll give you this cane, so use it to go home

1125
01:32:13,406 --> 01:32:15,984
Now I've paid my debt.

1126
01:32:18,445 --> 01:32:23,437
You have nothing to do with Kotoito anymore

1127
01:32:38,711 --> 01:32:42,398
My name will be popular? Hahahaha

1128
01:32:47,047 --> 01:32:50,953
I have just Bad name

1129
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:55,922
I didn't do it because I wanted that honor.

1130
01:32:56,983 --> 01:32:57,678
Bullshit

1131
01:32:59,125 --> 01:33:00,398
I won

1132
01:33:02,109 --> 01:33:05,547
Okinu and Kotoito

1133
01:33:07,304 --> 01:33:11,804
I..I won

1134
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:18,492
I won

1135
01:33:20,672 --> 01:33:22,632
I won

1136
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:35,241
THE END

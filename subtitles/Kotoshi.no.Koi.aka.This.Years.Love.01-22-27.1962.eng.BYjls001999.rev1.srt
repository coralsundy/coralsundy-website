Bash!Bash!

4
00:02:06,843 --> 00:02:09,093
What?You're not gonna resist?

5
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,295
You dress in outlandish clothes

6
00:02:12,974 --> 00:02:13,670
I can't stand the sight of you!

7
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:15,584
Uniformed schools have school rules

8
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:17,412
Why you don't have your hat?

9
00:02:17,834 --> 00:02:18,466
I have

10
00:02:19,162 --> 00:02:19,763
I have

11
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,185
Wear it if you have

12
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,207
Take your hat off

13
00:02:39,293 --> 00:02:40,832
Bash!Bash!

14
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:43,098
Fuck you! You stupid!

15
00:02:43,565 --> 00:02:44,495
You bustard!

16
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:46,230
Stand up!

17
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:48,019
Fuck you!

18
00:02:48,925 --> 00:02:50,565
Fuck off!  Eat Shit and die!

19
00:03:16,018 --> 00:03:18,104
I can't get on a train with this face

20
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:20,792
I'm taking a hired car home.
I'll take you to the station

21
00:03:21,237 --> 00:03:22,745
Well, I'll find a hired car

22
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:33,927
Long time no see!

23
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:36,943
What's the matter?

24
00:03:37,224 --> 00:03:39,607
You never call me at all.
I called you last night

25
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:40,841
I feel blue recently

26
00:03:41,488 --> 00:03:42,566
So do I

27
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,168
Why don't we go for playing golf next Sunday?

28
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:46,573
By the way

29
00:03:46,862 --> 00:03:48,863
I hear Tonko had a fight with Kacchan

30
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:51,667
She likes you better now

31
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:53,316
She calls you, right?

32
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,691
She does

33
00:03:55,081 --> 00:03:55,714
When?

34
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:56,792
Yesterday?

35
00:03:57,902 --> 00:03:58,738
Everyday

36
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,661
That's what I thought

37
00:04:01,231 --> 00:04:02,380
So you are into her?

38
00:04:02,802 --> 00:04:04,583
You are too noisy!
Mind your own business

39
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:06,810
You will get off at next stop, right?

40
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:08,396
I will go with you until Yokohama

41
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:09,497
You are too noisy!

42
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,036
I've told you I feel blue

43
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:24,966
See you.
I will call you tonight

44
00:04:43,217 --> 00:04:46,716
Local Train is coming for Shibuya

45
00:04:46,771 --> 00:04:49,393
Train is coming for Shibuya on platform 10

46
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:53,558
There is no waiting for the express train.
Please use this train

47
00:04:54,245 --> 00:04:55,604
You look good

48
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,737
I have no money for train ticket

49
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,643
I'm sorry but could you lend me some money?

50
00:05:02,181 --> 00:05:03,260
I don’t have enough money

51
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:05,609
I don't think so, You look rich

52
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:06,703
I borrowed this cloth

53
00:05:08,953 --> 00:05:09,898
I only have 100 yen

54
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,940
You are no use. then bye

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,713
I also feel blue

57
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:36,826
Because

58
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:39,544
Koike-san calls you,doesn't she?

59
00:05:40,693 --> 00:05:41,716
I know all

60
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,413
But it's up to you

61
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:47,320
I know that

62
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:52,142
I hear Tonko had a fight with Kacchan

63
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:54,463
You know that?

64
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:56,400
You know what

65
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:58,351
You're the cause of that

66
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,765
She calls you

67
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,281

77
00:06:58,913 --> 00:06:59,944
Fuck you!

78
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:03,100

Open the door whenever I come back home

82
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:30,656
Welcome back home

83
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,453
Where is my brother?

84
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,297
He has not come back yet

85
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,036
He didn’t come back home last night too

86
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:35,833
He said he will back home late tonight too

87
00:07:36,403 --> 00:07:37,599
This house is haunted

88
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:39,614
There's no one here but spirits

89
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,005
I'm here

90
00:07:41,684 --> 00:07:42,872
You are the ghost

91
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:45,130
You're in a bad mood

92
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:46,309
Yes I am

93
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,876
Your girlfriend is calling you

94
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,282
Be in good mood

95
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:52,032
Hello?

96
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,696
Will you have dinner right away?

97
00:07:53,829 --> 00:07:54,649
Of course

98
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:55,544
From Koike-san

99
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:57,513
What the heck!

100
00:08:04,739 --> 00:08:05,450
Hello?

101
00:08:06,036 --> 00:08:07,083
You are too noisy

102
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,083
We just met short time ago

103
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:10,963
I won't go!

104
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:12,642
I feel blue anyway

105
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:14,095
Bye

106
00:08:15,693 --> 00:08:17,974
Eat steak and Cure the blues

107
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:20,294
This is Matsuzaka beef

108
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,604
You cook nothing but beef steaks because it is easy to cock

109
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:24,221
Wash your hands

110
00:08:24,674 --> 00:08:26,901
I know.
You are too noisy

111
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:30,036
Ringing is making a lot of noise

112
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,223
Say her I'm not here

113
00:08:31,629 --> 00:08:33,481
Hello? Yes

114
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,789
I see. He has not come back home yet

115
00:08:37,422 --> 00:08:38,750
Yes, then see you

116
00:08:39,906 --> 00:08:40,477
Who was it?

117
00:08:40,711 --> 00:08:41,547
From Aikawa-san

118
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:43,571
You stupid, you should say him I'm here

119
00:08:55,485 --> 00:08:57,103
Hello? This is Yamada speaking

120
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:58,978
Oh you are on this phone

121
00:08:59,884 --> 00:09:01,204
Yes I was here

122
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:02,907
Because my old lady is mean

123
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,571
That's a false accusation

124
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,842
Shut up!

125
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,163
Hum? I was not taking about you

126
00:09:09,444 --> 00:09:11,358
Well...It's not been a good day

127
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:14,444
I was planing to call you

128
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:16,007
I'm back

129
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:18,433
Welcome back.
It's good timing

130
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,026
Yes

131
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:20,807
We got Matsuzaka beef

132
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:21,566
You are too noisy

133
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,784
You're well as always

134
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:23,988
He said he is blue

135
00:09:24,222 --> 00:09:25,089
You are too noisy!

136
00:09:27,003 --> 00:09:27,847
Therefore

137
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:30,120
Those senior are cocky

138
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:33,442
They still have four months before graduation

139
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:35,669
I'll train for that

140
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,114
I will have my revenge on them

141
00:09:37,192 --> 00:09:38,130
What a scary

142
00:09:39,442 --> 00:09:43,208
So you should quit playing basketball, a feminine sport

143
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,731
I will also quit playing golf

144
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:49,848
I can't say it now

145
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:51,863
Let's see you at school

146
00:09:52,847 --> 00:09:54,956
Then see you
Have a good evening

147
00:09:55,707 --> 00:09:56,840
You've been making suspicious phone calls

148
00:09:56,972 --> 00:09:57,972
Why do you think so?

149
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,194
I will train myself from tomorrow

150
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:00,452
I will beat them

151
00:10:00,686 --> 00:10:03,741
What would you say goodbye to a friend you see all the time?

152
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,186
Of course I say that
We are good friend

153
00:10:06,861 --> 00:10:08,190
What are you going to do tomorrow?

154
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:09,900
Both of you are going to study together?

155
00:10:10,049 --> 00:10:11,127
We will  study too

156
00:10:11,322 --> 00:10:11,994
Are you sure?

157
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:12,603
Shut up!

158
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:13,275
Shut up!

159
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,363
Hit the jab!

160
00:10:18,722 --> 00:10:19,316

161
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:26,611
Speed up!
Speed up!

162
00:10:27,704 --> 00:10:28,275

163
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,587
Hit the jab!
Hit the jab!

164
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,173
Pull down your chin

165
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:35,478
Straight!

166
00:10:36,337 --> 00:10:37,033
One two

167
00:10:38,362 --> 00:10:38,901
One two

168
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:45,104
Speed up!
Speed up!

169
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:46,665
Use your body!

170
00:11:26,112 --> 00:11:28,417
What are you going to do, join the boxing club?

171
00:11:28,862 --> 00:11:30,964
You're training yourself to get back at us?

172
00:11:31,221 --> 00:11:32,151
That's stupid

173
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,206
Say something

174
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:34,221
You bastard!

175
00:11:38,057 --> 00:11:38,815
Wait

176
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,904
If it's five against two, we're bound to lose

177
00:11:41,623 --> 00:11:43,084
If you're a senior, you should be fighting one-on-one

178
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:44,529
You people are a pain in the ass

179
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:46,960
Well, I will fight with you

180
00:11:47,757 --> 00:11:49,147
You will fight with him

181
00:11:52,014 --> 00:11:52,725
You bastard!

182
00:11:57,852 --> 00:11:58,649
You bastard!

183
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:02,227
Help me,Yamada!

184
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,123
Are you Ichiro?

185
00:12:58,873 --> 00:12:59,584
I'm back

186
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:31,240
Where is Ichiro?

187
00:13:31,404 --> 00:13:32,732
He has not come back home yet

188
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:34,873
Why you are lying?

189
00:13:37,256 --> 00:13:37,881
She is so rude

190
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,068
Oh

191
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:43,670
What's happened? your face...

192
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:46,257
Let me see

193
00:13:46,491 --> 00:13:47,413
I'm OK

194
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:49,022
What if your eyes go bad?

195
00:13:50,046 --> 00:13:52,437
You are injured.
Did you have a fighting with someone?

196
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:53,577
Mind your own business

197
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:54,937
Wash your face at bathroom right away

198
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:04,467
Did he hit you in the boxing ring?

199
00:14:05,163 --> 00:14:06,756
I hit him if he hits me

200
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,866
You are stupid

201
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:09,897
You should play basket ball

202
00:14:10,603 --> 00:14:12,384
Boxing doesn't suit you.

203
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:14,665
I'm going to put a potion on you

204
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,425
Oh, Mercurochrome medicine is missing

205
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:27,722
What's the matter?

206
00:14:28,175 --> 00:14:30,136
It seems Ichiro has fight with someone.
so He got injured

207
00:14:30,612 --> 00:14:32,229
Mercurochrome medicine is missing

208
00:14:33,764 --> 00:14:35,467
What's wrong with your legs

209
00:14:36,217 --> 00:14:37,952
I used it for my legs

210
00:14:38,241 --> 00:14:39,827
You'd better apply some other medicine

211
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:41,063
It's all red and disgusting

212
00:14:41,446 --> 00:14:42,336
Buy a Mercurochrome medicine

213
00:14:42,766 --> 00:14:44,047
We do have other ointment

214
00:14:44,447 --> 00:14:46,072
That medicine will hurt

215
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,891
That medicine will do the trick

216
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,500
Don't be silly!
Go to buy it

217
00:14:50,813 --> 00:14:51,696
Ok I get it

218
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,249
I'd like to try that potion

219
00:14:57,186 --> 00:14:58,077
What happened with her?

220
00:14:58,676 --> 00:14:59,528
She has been crazy

221
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:00,888
I will be crazy too

222
00:15:01,427 --> 00:15:03,943
By the way your friendships are bad

223
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:06,224
I hear he is called Yamada who is fag

224
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,966
Don't be friends with that rich man

225
00:15:09,794 --> 00:15:11,122
There are better friends than him

226
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:13,427
Your class has 40 to 50 students so

227
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:14,740
There is no good one other than him

228
00:15:15,536 --> 00:15:16,489
He is the best one

229
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:17,356
You are kidding

230
00:15:17,756 --> 00:15:19,552
There is no good man who plays boxing

231
00:15:21,026 --> 00:15:22,417
That sport is for punks

232
00:15:23,191 --> 00:15:25,933
Students should play other sports

233
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,378
The home of boxing is England

234
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,659
So what?

235
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,448
The home of the pirates is also England

236
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:32,589
I'm not surprised

237
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:33,643
You look bad

238
00:15:35,674 --> 00:15:37,385
There is no good man of your friends

239
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:39,283
You get beaten up for looking so cocky

240
00:15:39,713 --> 00:15:40,674
I think so

241
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:41,838
Shut up

242
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,224
I asked him to play boxing

243
00:15:44,404 --> 00:15:45,537
Aikawa is the son of a restaurateur in Ginza?

244
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,255
Yes, he said like he gets his revenge or something

245
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,225
Shut up!

246
00:15:49,486 --> 00:15:50,712
I worry about you

247
00:15:50,837 --> 00:15:51,392
It hurts!

248
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,564
You should be patient

249
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,329
Why you begin to play boxing?

250
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,854
You don't know the world

251
00:15:59,385 --> 00:16:00,643
You have no idea what's going on in the world

252
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:03,041
Boxing is popular in the Soviet Union and the United States

253
00:16:03,682 --> 00:16:04,588
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth

254
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,174
Don't scare me

255
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,748
Our father is busy with his work,
I am also busy with my study

256
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:11,662
You are talking right

257
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,080
You had good grades until college

258
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,393
Do not say "until college"

259
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:20,235
Your grades have dropped since you went to graduate school

260
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:21,275
That’s not true!

261
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:23,712
Your grades have dropped tremendously

262
00:16:24,394 --> 00:16:26,987
Students have to study

263
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:29,769
Your father is a corporate executive

264
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:32,168
I am the maid of this house

265
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:36,215
Do your best to do your jobs

266
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:39,439
Who's on this phone?

267
00:16:41,424 --> 00:16:42,502
Yes

268
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:44,026
Yes we are

269
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,649
Yes he is here

270
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:46,743
Please wait a min

271
00:16:46,787 --> 00:16:47,451
From him

272
00:16:47,623 --> 00:16:50,365
Not you,
Your girlfriend is on the phone

273
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:57,446
When I was younger, I didn't make as many calls

274
00:16:57,757 --> 00:16:58,749
There was no phone at the time

275
00:16:59,007 --> 00:16:59,405
When?

276
00:16:59,592 --> 00:17:02,311
You're very brazen or something

277
00:17:02,428 --> 00:17:03,382
I'm very positive

278
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:06,143
In that case You can't study calmly

279
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:07,760
You are too noisy.
Shut up

280
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,791
I can't stay silent. I'm responsible for what happened

281
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,713
I'm your mother's replacement

282
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,198
I've been raising you since you were babies

283
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:17,182
Do you understand?

284
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:27,377
Welcome

285
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,580
Welcome

286
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,166
There is a seat upstairs

287
00:17:30,276 --> 00:17:30,893
Here is fine

288
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:38,201
You know a stylish place

289
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:39,388
This is my first visit

290
00:17:42,998 --> 00:17:44,060
Can I take your order?

291
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:45,271
What do you want?

292
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,392
Well, anything you like

293
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,103
Well, we’ll leave it up to you

294
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:51,291
Sake?

295
00:17:51,611 --> 00:17:52,033
Beer

296
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:52,603
Certainly

297
00:17:54,407 --> 00:17:56,579
Welcome
Welcome,Welcome

298
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,399
Shall we go upstairs?

299
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:05,938
Here is better

300
00:18:06,636 --> 00:18:08,183
I don't really like to sit on the floor

301
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:09,776
You are not kind

302
00:18:10,698 --> 00:18:12,144
I don't know. What should I do?

303
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:14,620
Do whatever you want

304
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,581
So,If I turn down a marriage proposal

305
00:18:18,003 --> 00:18:19,073
what you will do?

306
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,128
I don't like the way you say

307
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,509
Then I should say like what?

308
00:18:23,237 --> 00:18:24,776
I don't know why you take it so seriously

309
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,088
This is serious for me

310
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,151
so I don't like to go upstairs

311
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:34,886
Is the food ready upstairs?

312
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:35,589
Yes it's ready

313
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:40,792
Are you a sister of her?

314
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,441
No she is a daughter

315
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,105
She is beautiful, isn't she?

316
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,980
So the man in the kitchen is your father?

317
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:49,605
She is your mother

318
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:50,987
Yes she is

319
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:52,612
Why you ask her a lot?

320
00:18:53,151 --> 00:18:53,995
I have reason to ask her

321
00:18:54,284 --> 00:18:55,105
Here it is

322
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:57,988
So Please bring beers upstairs

323
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:58,698
Yes

324
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:00,231
How many beers did you deliver upstairs?

325
00:19:00,575 --> 00:19:01,465
8 beers

326
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:05,735
If they drank that much, they wouldn't be able to taste the food

327
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,497
There are a lot of vulgar customers these days.

328
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:10,973
The owner of this restaurant complains a lot.

329
00:19:11,278 --> 00:19:12,231
Let's go upstairs

330
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,372
You said you don't like

331
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,078
The owner of this place scares me and I don't want to drink here

332
00:19:15,828 --> 00:19:17,148
Excuse me, We are going to upstairs

333
00:19:17,368 --> 00:19:18,414
Yes, please go

334
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:28,634
Welcome

335
00:19:44,876 --> 00:19:46,978
You came upstairs because you wanted to see that woman's face, didn't you?

336
00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:48,744
I'm surprised

337
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:49,845
For what?

338
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,025
She is so beautiful

339
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:55,938
Are you making fun of me?
I'm having trouble

340
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,266
But I can't do anything for you

341
00:19:58,415 --> 00:19:59,962
You should say you marry me

342
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,165
Why I have to say that?

343
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:03,602
Because I like you

344
00:20:04,507 --> 00:20:05,515
You are kidding

345
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,890
Excuse me

346
00:20:11,668 --> 00:20:12,777
You don't have to sit back

347
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,205
Shall I pour beer?

348
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:48,269
Please

349
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:48,988
yes

350
00:20:49,602 --> 00:20:54,039
We had a call from Ichiro,
 he said he will stay at his friend's house tonight

351
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,297
At who's place?

352
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:56,430
He said in Yokohama or something...

353
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:57,885
He does nothing but play

354
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:00,385
He's playing with such bad friends

355
00:21:02,526 --> 00:21:04,511
There are many bad kids in Yokohama region

356
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:06,164
Is that right?

357
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:07,531
You are kidding

358
00:21:08,093 --> 00:21:09,500
There are more bad kids in Tokyo

359
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:11,719
A lot of high school kids are bad these days

360
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:15,015
He's quiet at home,
but he has a lot of bad friends

361
00:21:15,664 --> 00:21:16,820
This guy is bad too

362
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:17,864
What?

363
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,895
Please make yourself at home.
Shall I bring beers?

364
00:21:21,231 --> 00:21:23,700
Please bring a lot.
We don't care the taste of your foods

365
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:25,231
Certainly

366
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:30,325
You are so rude

367
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,118
You take an immediate interest in beautiful women

368
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,106
Refill!

369
00:21:52,419 --> 00:21:53,536
Let's make a toast to say goodbye

370
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:56,136
what the hell you doing!

371
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:57,823
You're awful

372
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,597
You know what?
I'm just friend of you

373
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:03,247
I didn't do anything wrong with you

374
00:22:03,295 --> 00:22:04,904
You held my hands at the night

375
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:06,662
You said it's a lovely moon

376
00:22:07,084 --> 00:22:08,670
You held me my hands

377
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:10,519
And then I got burned by a cigarette

378
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:11,699
Not at the time

379
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:13,480
In the woods of Karuizawa

380
00:22:13,863 --> 00:22:15,253
You asked me out that time

381
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:16,870
We held hands and sang

382
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:17,917
That's ridiculous

383
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:20,573
You deny us our memories

384
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:21,745
Excuse me

385
00:22:24,191 --> 00:22:26,761
Oh..What's wrong with you?

386
00:22:27,355 --> 00:22:28,347
I'm wetting

387
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:29,761
We just moved to upstairs but..

388
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,097
You wanted to see her face, so we moved to upstairs

389
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:33,815
I don't care about you anymore

390
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,511
We are leaving so check please

391
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:36,683
I'm leaving

392
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:38,730
Please share time with him

393
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,075
I will take care of your outfit

394
00:22:49,372 --> 00:22:50,192
Thank you

395
00:22:56,016 --> 00:22:57,360
You are Yamada-san

396
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:58,922
Yes boring name

397
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:02,199
My brother's bad friend is also called Yamada.
I'm really in trouble

398
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,707
Please wait a min

399
00:23:10,494 --> 00:23:11,619
I'm  in trouble too

400
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:30,443
There's a phone call for you

401
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:31,264
Thank you

402
00:23:33,943 --> 00:23:34,490
I'm tired

403
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:37,850
You are busy, aren't you?
You think a lot, you know

404
00:23:38,373 --> 00:23:40,091
I feel distressed when it's quiet

405
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:43,198
It's normal to study in a quiet place

406
00:23:43,495 --> 00:23:46,659
It's weird to study in a noisy place

407
00:23:46,739 --> 00:23:48,168
This house is haunted

408
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:49,590
I am the ghost

409
00:23:51,926 --> 00:23:54,043
I'm ok.
I'm not playing

410
00:23:54,862 --> 00:23:55,948
We are studying together

411
00:23:56,909 --> 00:23:58,776
It's true!
Ask my friend

412
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:00,620
You should study seriously

413
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,826
I don't want to be invited to a parents' meeting

414
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:05,381
I know that.
See you

415
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,059
He said see you

416
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,886
No use complaining to him

417
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:14,840
Mom's never been called to be a teacher before

418
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:19,113
If he flunks out, we can make him a cook

419
00:24:19,246 --> 00:24:21,028
He's not going to learn how to cook

420
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:23,030
He's at an age now where he wants to play

421
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:26,038
I have never studied in my life

422
00:24:26,155 --> 00:24:28,257
Of course.
You didn't graduate even junior high school

423
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:30,789
I didn't think anything of it at the time

424
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:35,805
My parents also told me that if I didn't like school, I could just quit

425
00:24:36,492 --> 00:24:37,469
That was the time

426
00:24:37,547 --> 00:24:39,664
But you played a lot

427
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:41,086
You got into the habit of it

428
00:24:41,569 --> 00:24:43,912
Whenever you see a girl,
You ask her out

429
00:24:45,092 --> 00:24:47,647
Finally I got you

430
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,155
We're just like each other

431
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,342
You couldn't even write a love letter because you never learned

432
00:24:51,389 --> 00:24:52,764
I am astounded by his attitude

433
00:24:53,178 --> 00:24:53,920
Welcome

434
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:55,975
Welcome!
Sorry

435
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,819
Oh here is nice place

436
00:25:03,984 --> 00:25:04,616
Thank you

437
00:25:06,117 --> 00:25:08,406
The food and the women are wonderful here

438
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,000
Yes

439
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:09,921
I am not

440
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,151
Don't be shy,
you're amazing

441
00:25:13,823 --> 00:25:15,120
Do you like my back?

442
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:16,393
If I choose anything

443
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,916
I'm just the draw

444
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,464
welcome

445
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:34,783
welcome

446
00:25:40,744 --> 00:25:43,197
He's the executive director of Yokohama Commercial

447
00:25:43,494 --> 00:25:44,244
Nice to meet you

448
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,690
In my business, I'm picky about taste

449
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:48,081
It’s pleasure to meet you

450
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:49,012
Please

451
00:25:49,121 --> 00:25:49,980
I'm Yamada

452
00:25:50,269 --> 00:25:51,558
I will come here often

453
00:25:52,293 --> 00:25:53,293
Oh you are Yamada-san?

454
00:25:53,527 --> 00:25:53,816
Yes

455
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,155
You know him?

456
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:59,507
No No,
The customer who just left was also Mr. Yamata

457
00:26:00,114 --> 00:26:01,559
Oh, that's incident

458
00:26:01,942 --> 00:26:03,817
Which Yamada do you like?

459
00:26:04,348 --> 00:26:05,903
That customer looked so young

460
00:26:06,634 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm also young

461
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,259
He was in a lot of trouble

462
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:12,212
He was here with a woman

463
00:26:12,532 --> 00:26:14,149
The woman splashed beer in his face

464
00:26:14,541 --> 00:26:16,447
Oh that's too bad

465
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,306
Then Do you want to splash beer on my face?

466
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:22,720
I don't trust Yamada-san in Yokohama.
There are many bad people

467
00:26:23,361 --> 00:26:25,142
That's a nice greeting

468
00:26:25,368 --> 00:26:26,900
She knows all of me

469
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:28,376
You are too bad

470
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:47,659
He is my older brother

471
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,190
Shall I say hi to him?

472
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:50,745
Be polite

473
00:26:51,018 --> 00:26:51,636
I will

474
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:52,979
I'm polite

475
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,815
Welcome back

476
00:27:07,104 --> 00:27:07,940
Can you cook something for me?

477
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,144
Do you want to eat something?

478
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,410
I couldn't eat at the restaurant

479
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,784
I will ready it soon

480
00:27:20,823 --> 00:27:21,448
Welcome back

481
00:27:22,708 --> 00:27:23,669
Oh you

482
00:27:23,763 --> 00:27:24,521
It's good to meet you

483
00:27:24,857 --> 00:27:25,630
Take your seats

484
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,255
What do you want to drink?

485
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:28,138
Water

486
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,247
Don't be formal

487
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,161
Don't be hesitate

488
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:31,192
Thank you

489
00:27:32,716 --> 00:27:33,638
Do you have any siblings?

490
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:34,653
I have one older sister

491
00:27:35,755 --> 00:27:36,700
So you feel lonely

492
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,864
But Yamada-kun has also one sibling

493
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:41,810
It's hard enough to have several brothers like him

494
00:27:42,356 --> 00:27:43,442
I have to be hard on you

495
00:27:44,187 --> 00:27:45,461
My sister also has to be hard on me

496
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:47,422
She is very beautiful woman

497
00:27:47,781 --> 00:27:48,766
She's famous at school

498
00:27:49,008 --> 00:27:49,680
I've heard that

499
00:27:50,218 --> 00:27:51,553
Your brother is famous at school too

500
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:52,647
Oh really?

501
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,507
He is handsome and tall

502
00:27:54,827 --> 00:27:56,335
Don't flatter him.
He'll be wrong

503
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:58,343
That's what the girls in my class said

504
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,562
Who is the woman?

505
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,781
My soul mate

506
00:28:00,921 --> 00:28:03,156
You stupid.
I told you not to say anything funny to him

507
00:28:04,443 --> 00:28:05,091
So Enjoy your drink

508
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,755
Do you want to eat beef steak?

509
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:07,584
Yes I want

510
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,779
You always cook steak

511
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,457
You will be smarter if you eat steaks

512
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,317
Please study much harder

513
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,020
She is always complaining

514
00:28:16,229 --> 00:28:17,409
You will have an exam soon?

515
00:28:18,089 --> 00:28:18,948
We studied together

516
00:28:19,425 --> 00:28:20,245
I'm tired

517
00:28:20,651 --> 00:28:22,291
You study while listening to Jazz

518
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:22,987
Shut up!

519
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:24,392
She is always complaining

520
00:28:24,962 --> 00:28:25,665
Let's go back room

521
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:27,751
We will study hard

522
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:42,868
Anyway his sister is wonderful

523
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,903
Why are you laughing?

524
00:28:50,912 --> 00:28:54,716
Anyway Regardless of his study...

525
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:56,740
Totally...

526
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,405
He is not bad student but..

527
00:29:01,597 --> 00:29:03,823
How can I say... he is mysterious

528
00:29:04,753 --> 00:29:06,737
I think he needs to study more

529
00:29:07,944 --> 00:29:09,757
Moreover he starts to play boxing

530
00:29:10,046 --> 00:29:13,124
He's too tired to study when he gets home

531
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,909
No matter which club he joined...

532
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:19,588
It's same

533
00:29:21,189 --> 00:29:22,423
I'm sorry I had a cold

534
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,939
But He doesn't have to play the fisticuffs sport.

535
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:28,760
And I think he has bad friends

536
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:31,885
How was the result of Yamada?

537
00:29:32,487 --> 00:29:34,338
He was not good so much

538
00:29:35,111 --> 00:29:38,869
I asked his brother,
but he has not come here yet

539
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:40,556
He doesn't feel like coming

540
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:43,154
birds of a feather flock together

541
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:46,646
Why doesn't he have any smart friends?

542
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:49,429
That's what I thought too

543
00:29:49,749 --> 00:29:51,366
They are matched

544
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,347
Both has very nice personality

545
00:29:55,383 --> 00:29:56,993
They wants to be bad or

546
00:29:57,364 --> 00:30:00,325
They're old enough to be interested in women

547
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:04,277
If you, we can do anything for them

548
00:30:04,597 --> 00:30:05,401
But it's not

549
00:30:05,828 --> 00:30:11,336
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do to them

550
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,664
Do not misunderstand that I give up with them

551
00:30:17,101 --> 00:30:20,078
I'm in trouble as a teacher

552
00:30:20,648 --> 00:30:22,211
I've got a cold and I feel terrible

553
00:30:25,176 --> 00:30:26,402
I'm sorry I'm late

554
00:30:27,614 --> 00:30:28,457
Oh

555
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:29,528
You are here too

556
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,425
You are the Yamada's brother

557
00:30:33,644 --> 00:30:34,699
I'm older brother of Hikaru

558
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:37,004
Why you didn't say that before

559
00:30:38,463 --> 00:30:39,885
You told bad about him so

560
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:41,361
I had no time to say it

561
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,689
And you were with that woman

562
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,470
She had nothing to do with it

563
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:49,115
Teacher,I understand what kind of his friend is Yamada

564
00:30:49,373 --> 00:30:50,224
Can I go home?

565
00:30:50,428 --> 00:30:51,123
Yes go ahead

566
00:30:51,209 --> 00:30:52,482
Thank you very much

567
00:30:54,154 --> 00:30:54,717
Excuse me

568
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,591
Please wait a min

569
00:30:56,335 --> 00:30:58,202
What do you mean you understand how my brother is?

570
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:00,491
Because he is your younger brother

571
00:31:06,171 --> 00:31:07,030
I'm sorry for that

572
00:31:07,085 --> 00:31:08,241
Don't worry about that

573
00:31:08,804 --> 00:31:09,593
Please take your seats

574
00:31:10,171 --> 00:31:11,444
It seems I had a cold

575
00:31:15,518 --> 00:31:16,338
You feel pain?

576
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:17,221
Take your seats

577
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:20,565
She is very beautiful, isn't she?

578
00:31:22,362 --> 00:31:23,502
Let me see...

579
00:31:24,524 --> 00:31:28,383
You need to consider if I am wrong or you are wrong

580
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:31,722
Every semester the teacher calls me out and I'm in trouble

581
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,550
I will do it from now

582
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:36,183
You're all talk.
Do you really want to go to university?

583
00:31:36,663 --> 00:31:37,311
I don't care

584
00:31:37,553 --> 00:31:38,389
I don't care too

585
00:31:38,436 --> 00:31:39,631
Be quiet

586
00:31:40,249 --> 00:31:43,155
I don't mean for you to be brilliant

587
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:45,603
I don't care if you're in last place,
I want you to do well

588
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:51,456
Don't you think you're lucky that so many people want to go to college but can't?

589
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:52,417
I know that

590
00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:53,426
You should appreciate for it

591
00:31:54,074 --> 00:31:54,613
She says right

592
00:31:54,918 --> 00:31:55,887
I think so

593
00:31:55,926 --> 00:31:56,456
Hey you

594
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,667
I'm thankful.
But happiness is another thing

595
00:32:00,065 --> 00:32:02,456
What do you mean by another?
You are cheeky

596
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,687
We're lucky we're not now

597
00:32:05,719 --> 00:32:08,188
There's no one like you, not even in the past

598
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,093
You think so?

599
00:32:09,117 --> 00:32:10,149
Yes, true

600
00:32:10,647 --> 00:32:12,936
Anyway, you should stop boxing

601
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,592
I will stop if you want me

602
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:16,427
I think it's a good manly sport

603
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:17,897
Be quiet

604
00:32:18,858 --> 00:32:22,022
And you should stop to be friend with Yamada

605
00:32:22,718 --> 00:32:24,421
What responsibility does he have for my academic performance?

606
00:32:24,686 --> 00:32:27,218
Both of you are doing poorly in school because you spend all your time playing

607
00:32:27,678 --> 00:32:30,248
A man should not only study, but also play.

608
00:32:30,436 --> 00:32:32,960
All you did was play

609
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,766
Please be quiet

610
00:32:35,819 --> 00:32:36,654
You know what

611
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,381
You can play as long as you study

612
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:40,444
You see?

613
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:43,157
Both of you go back to restaurant

614
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:45,501
I get it, by the way

615
00:32:46,092 --> 00:32:49,764
Fujii's son wants to take you as his wife

616
00:32:50,624 --> 00:32:53,311
No way.
He just eloped the other night

617
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,685
You should consider yourself too

618
00:32:56,037 --> 00:32:57,685
I don't need you to tell me what to think

619
00:32:58,037 --> 00:33:01,154
Wear nice Kimono, bring beers, get nice guy, makes you happy, right?

620
00:33:02,045 --> 00:33:03,631
You stupid, you are still a kid

621
00:33:06,513 --> 00:33:09,700
You don't have to study a lot.
Just study some more

622
00:33:09,834 --> 00:33:11,381
A little study won't get you into college

623
00:33:11,654 --> 00:33:12,193
Yes

624
00:33:12,873 --> 00:33:14,006
What do you want to be in the future?

625
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:16,981
You work for yourself,
you live for yourself

626
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:19,232
It'll be fine

627
00:33:19,543 --> 00:33:20,887
You won't be fine

628
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:23,569
What are you going to do after you finish graduate school?

629
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,819
I will work for a company

630
00:33:25,928 --> 00:33:27,069
Then what you will do?

631
00:33:27,434 --> 00:33:28,450
I will work there

632
00:33:28,817 --> 00:33:30,661
He'll be president or an executive

633
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:31,349
Yes

634
00:33:31,591 --> 00:33:32,559
What do you mean by that?

635
00:33:32,597 --> 00:33:34,542
What are you saying?
That's a good job

636
00:33:35,551 --> 00:33:36,214
That's pointless

637
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:39,105
You are right.
It might be pointless

638
00:33:41,778 --> 00:33:42,762
What did you say?

639
00:33:43,598 --> 00:33:45,379
Meaning exists or it doesn't

640
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,606
It's about how you lived

641
00:33:49,672 --> 00:33:50,828
How can meaning exist in our lives?

642
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:51,945
In this world

643
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,562
You don't understand if I explain

644
00:33:53,773 --> 00:33:56,180
I found that out the hard way myself

645
00:33:59,905 --> 00:34:00,812
Hello?

646
00:34:01,054 --> 00:34:02,390
Sorry, he is out now

647
00:34:04,413 --> 00:34:06,452
I don't understand the family history of these women

648
00:34:07,773 --> 00:34:10,609
Anyway you should stop to be friend with Aikawa

649
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:12,148
Why do you say that?

650
00:34:12,407 --> 00:34:13,594
That's good for you

651
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:15,367
Whatever!

652
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:28,499
Too noisy

653
00:34:30,827 --> 00:34:31,569
Hello?

654
00:34:31,921 --> 00:34:33,171
Oh master

655
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:12,274
I wonder what so many people are thinking when they come here.

656
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:14,774
They are not human being

657
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:16,845
They are man and woman

658
00:35:18,126 --> 00:35:21,204
What is the Christmas?
With the ashes of the atomic bomb flying in the air

659
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,274
What kind of idiot looks at his hands and prays?

660
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,146
I hope the atomic bomb kills them all

661
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:32,062
Oh my god!

662
00:35:36,187 --> 00:35:37,093
Brother!

663
00:35:39,561 --> 00:35:40,592
Let me sleep with you?

664
00:35:40,686 --> 00:35:41,702
What's wrong?

665
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,858
I'm afraid of the ghosts!

666
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:45,217
You are idiot

667
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,819
I could hear the rain, I was so scared I was shaking

668
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:58,333
Oh my god!

669
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:02,294
What are you doing at mid night?

670
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:26,962
Sorry for keeping you wait

671
00:36:33,486 --> 00:36:34,502
She is beautiful,isn't she?

672
00:36:34,994 --> 00:36:38,174
Yes true, she is really beautiful

673
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:39,486
Thank you very much

674
00:36:39,642 --> 00:36:40,486
Are you from Kyoto?

675
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:41,861
Yes I am

676
00:36:42,189 --> 00:36:44,470
She's the daughter of one of my regular inns

677
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:48,314
Do not say daughter, I am too old

678
00:36:49,657 --> 00:36:51,306
Anyway it's good to meet you

679
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,227
it's good to meet you too

680
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,228
I am also a live-in woman

681
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,720
It's a lot of work when your family is in the hospitality business

682
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:01,016
They use me a lot

683
00:37:01,704 --> 00:37:02,892
In return, business will flourish

684
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:03,556
Thank you

685
00:37:04,251 --> 00:37:04,978
I will pour your tea

686
00:37:05,072 --> 00:37:05,938
Thank you

687
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,251
Just a cup of tea

688
00:37:08,236 --> 00:37:09,197
Excuse me

689
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:11,079
Mikako-san

690
00:37:11,173 --> 00:37:11,540
Yes

691
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:13,556
Yamada-san is here to see you

692
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:15,141
Yamada-san is downstars?

693
00:37:15,384 --> 00:37:16,618
I invited him to take a seat

694
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,868
He needs to tell you something

695
00:37:18,314 --> 00:37:19,423
I'm going

696
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,923
It's a curious connection

697
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:25,733
Whenever I come here sometime, that Yamada-san will appear

698
00:37:26,257 --> 00:37:27,624
Then please make yourself at home

699
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:48,856
Sorry for the other day

700
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:49,904
I was rude, sorry

701
00:37:50,264 --> 00:37:51,022
Well...

702
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:52,451
Where is the rest room?

703
00:37:52,943 --> 00:37:53,670
This way please

704
00:37:56,242 --> 00:37:57,117
It's at the end of the hallway

705
00:37:57,297 --> 00:37:57,922
Thank you

706
00:38:19,712 --> 00:38:20,884
This is for women

707
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:31,692
Excuse me

708
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:34,185
My brother has been taking care of you

709
00:38:35,326 --> 00:38:36,224
You're being sarcastic?

710
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:39,724
My brother is strange

711
00:38:39,896 --> 00:38:41,513
My brother is strange too

712
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:45,954
But I want to talk to you to avoid misunderstandings

713
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:50,700
My brother is still a kid.
He's not as bad as you think

714
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:53,568
I'm here to honor my brother

715
00:38:53,925 --> 00:38:54,925
I know that

716
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:59,948
Unlike my brother, you and your father have good education

717
00:39:00,493 --> 00:39:01,423
I didn't mean that

718
00:39:01,848 --> 00:39:03,645
You also have a great restaurant in your house

719
00:39:03,926 --> 00:39:07,356
We can't educate our children in this water business of ours.

720
00:39:08,537 --> 00:39:09,545
Right back at you

721
00:39:10,701 --> 00:39:11,467
But

722
00:39:12,186 --> 00:39:15,351
The first time I met you, I made a blunder

723
00:39:16,108 --> 00:39:18,444
It made you look bad to us

724
00:39:19,016 --> 00:39:21,008
Anyway my brother is only one son

725
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,579
He is very important to us

726
00:39:22,907 --> 00:39:24,118
My brother is important too

727
00:39:24,272 --> 00:39:26,093
It's the same for one or two people

728
00:39:26,452 --> 00:39:30,335
I don't want him asking my brother to play boxing.
I worry his nose gets broken

729
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:31,999
I told him that too

730
00:39:32,093 --> 00:39:33,608
It didn't work

731
00:39:34,513 --> 00:39:37,528
If he's a good friend, I'd suggest he stop boxing and start studying

732
00:39:38,677 --> 00:39:41,130
Not just for fun, he also gives good advice

733
00:39:41,521 --> 00:39:43,685
So I'm here to talk about that

734
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:45,829
While bringing your girlfriend and fighting?

735
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:46,932
You talk bad

736
00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:49,049
You came here to check how we are, right?

737
00:39:49,661 --> 00:39:51,747
You came here to check how my brother's home

738
00:39:52,427 --> 00:39:53,419
That's not true

739
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,841
Don't get too comfortable with me

740
00:39:56,824 --> 00:39:57,432
Sorry

741
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:58,268
You are his older sister

742
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:59,667
I'm his god-sister

743
00:40:00,503 --> 00:40:01,940
I was flabbergasted

744
00:40:02,706 --> 00:40:04,667
Anyway call your sister and serve me some beers

745
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:08,340
Certainly.
If you are a customer, you can say anything you want. Beer, right?

746
00:40:12,441 --> 00:40:13,316
Beers..

747
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:15,215
This is where I was dumped

748
00:40:18,205 --> 00:40:18,932
I will serve it

749
00:40:19,047 --> 00:40:19,695
Bring beers to Tsuki room

750
00:40:19,758 --> 00:40:20,703
Certainly

751
00:40:23,969 --> 00:40:25,453
Don't worry

752
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:27,234
I'm not trying to be difficult

753
00:40:28,086 --> 00:40:29,352
I am happy now

754
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,492
Excuse me

755
00:40:38,026 --> 00:40:39,276
How is that Yamada-san?

756
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:42,339
According to Kiku, he is handsome man

757
00:40:43,206 --> 00:40:45,316
I don't care his looks,  I am upset with him

758
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:47,628
That's very suspicious

759
00:40:48,854 --> 00:40:50,713
He is a brother of my friend

760
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:52,722
So That's more suspicious

761
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,105
That's not suspicious

762
00:40:54,347 --> 00:40:56,073
His family is suspicious

763
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:58,605
The other day I was called into school again

764
00:40:59,852 --> 00:41:01,329
You're in a lot of trouble

765
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:02,993
What would you like?

766
00:41:03,118 --> 00:41:04,172
Anything OK

767
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,524
Oh..and

768
00:41:06,937 --> 00:41:09,969
Can you call my home and tell I will be stay at Tokyo tonight?

769
00:41:10,883 --> 00:41:11,538
This is the phone number

770
00:41:11,578 --> 00:41:12,211
Yes

771
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:17,437
Hmm...This phone number...

772
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,804
What? do you know?

773
00:41:19,945 --> 00:41:21,929
That's what I thought

774
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,405
I will tell you clearly

775
00:41:55,106 --> 00:41:57,935
I don't want my brother to be friends with your brother

776
00:41:59,091 --> 00:42:01,888
I see, I understand what you think

777
00:42:02,622 --> 00:42:03,794
I will tell my brother so

778
00:42:04,184 --> 00:42:05,481
I'm disgust with it

779
00:42:05,794 --> 00:42:07,051
I'm disgust with it

780
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:09,020
You think only your brother is wonderful

781
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:11,434
You think only my brother is bad

782
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:13,387
I don't know whether your brother is bad or not

783
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:14,130
But

784
00:42:14,372 --> 00:42:15,255
You ask me too much

785
00:42:15,356 --> 00:42:16,950
I'm disgust with you and your father

786
00:42:17,356 --> 00:42:18,208
You said what?

787
00:42:18,509 --> 00:42:21,845
There's a beautiful woman and this man in the room over there

788
00:42:23,837 --> 00:42:24,305
Oh!

789
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,265
Oh you

790
00:42:37,515 --> 00:42:38,718
You are here as I thought

791
00:42:41,451 --> 00:42:42,693
Well, sit down

792
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:45,873
I will introduce her

793
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,417
This is more than a strange fate

794
00:42:49,871 --> 00:42:51,035
You are here too

795
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,441
I'm embarrassing

796
00:42:53,191 --> 00:42:54,402
Why you are embarrassing?

797
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:57,108
She said you had a woman pour beer in your face

798
00:42:57,655 --> 00:42:58,663
Hahahaha

799
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:00,624
He is our elder brother

800
00:43:02,202 --> 00:43:04,468
Well, It's very nice to see you

801
00:43:23,658 --> 00:43:24,634
Welcome back

802
00:43:24,681 --> 00:43:25,353
Where is Ichiro?

803
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:26,986
I don't know

804
00:43:27,056 --> 00:43:28,783
He is here or not?

805
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:29,978
There's no point asking

806
00:43:30,095 --> 00:43:31,166
I'm disgust with you

807
00:43:31,627 --> 00:43:32,666
He is not here

808
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:34,861
I wonder if he is with him

809
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:53,839
Hello? this is Yamada residence

810
00:43:54,268 --> 00:43:56,698
No, he is not here

811
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,752
No, Hikaru is out now too

812
00:44:00,298 --> 00:44:04,548
Excuse me, and your master will stay at Tokyo tonight

813
00:44:05,707 --> 00:44:07,363
Yes, see you

814
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,464
I'm sure They are playing together

815
00:44:26,035 --> 00:44:27,762
Right attack! Right attack!

816
00:44:45,388 --> 00:44:46,076
Right attack!

817
00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:54,043
Hey Shige-Chan

818
00:44:54,824 --> 00:44:57,145
I'm hungry, can you make rice with tea poured on it for me?

819
00:44:59,046 --> 00:45:00,226
Hey Shige-Chan

820
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,039
Yes

821
00:45:02,273 --> 00:45:03,977
can you make rice with tea poured on it for me?

822
00:45:04,492 --> 00:45:06,328
Do you want to eat at this mid night?

823
00:45:06,516 --> 00:45:07,797
I'm hungry

824
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:10,274
It's bad to eat at this mid night

825
00:45:10,485 --> 00:45:11,727
I want to eat

826
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:13,500
There's a tangerine in there

827
00:45:13,555 --> 00:45:15,289
I want to eat rice with tea poured on it

828
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,047
I didn't want to wake up

829
00:45:18,406 --> 00:45:19,992
I will go to cook

830
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:22,399
You doze off in your spare time

831
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,656
If a thief breaks into your house, you won't know it

832
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,547
I'm afraid to think so too

833
00:45:27,617 --> 00:45:28,977
What did you say?

834
00:45:30,841 --> 00:45:32,849
What does Ichiro do when he is alone?

835
00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:35,217
I don't know at all

836
00:45:35,428 --> 00:45:36,795
He watches TV or something?

837
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,372
No, he said watching TV is boring

838
00:45:40,913 --> 00:45:42,538
You should watch with him

839
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:44,873
I don't want to look at it because it makes my eyes worse

840
00:45:47,357 --> 00:45:49,052
Let's see if there are any interesting TV shows

841
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:56,513
Being alone is boring

842
00:45:56,761 --> 00:45:59,511
if you feel being alone is boring, you should marry someone

843
00:45:59,707 --> 00:46:00,863
It's not easy

844
00:46:01,152 --> 00:46:01,949
You think so?

845
00:46:05,525 --> 00:46:08,064
Oh it was close

846
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:09,978
You said you don't watch

847
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,180
I want to watch boxing

848
00:46:12,994 --> 00:46:14,916
Man's sports is nice

849
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:15,736
You're disgusting

850
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:19,377
oh.. no way, I know you are too

851
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:20,510
What do you mean?

852
00:46:20,581 --> 00:46:22,565
I know you want husband

853
00:46:22,874 --> 00:46:24,326
You don't have any good people coming to your store,
do you?

854
00:46:24,413 --> 00:46:25,483
You are so rude

855
00:46:25,874 --> 00:46:27,764
My husband is very nice

856
00:46:28,304 --> 00:46:30,561
The other day I had a cough and he gave me some cold medicine

857
00:46:31,445 --> 00:46:34,070
So you bought the wrong medicine the other day

858
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,289
I've got better now, see?

859
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:37,461
I'm disgust with you

860
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,102
You should find good man to marry

861
00:46:40,149 --> 00:46:41,524
Mind your own business

862
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:42,993
You cry sour grapes

863
00:46:53,930 --> 00:46:57,626
I thought you were going to stay at Tokyo,
because Aikawa-san called us

864
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,539
I heard that a guest wants to stay in Atami

865
00:47:02,298 --> 00:47:04,274
I had a client go alone

866
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:09,145
I'm in trouble with him

867
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:10,958
Shall we find home tutor?

868
00:47:11,418 --> 00:47:14,026
If he's not motivated, there's nothing you can do

869
00:47:18,798 --> 00:47:21,391
Hello? this is Yamada residence

870
00:47:22,055 --> 00:47:23,626
Oh Please wait a min

871
00:47:24,407 --> 00:47:25,368
From your brother

872
00:47:25,635 --> 00:47:27,448
I will take it

873
00:47:29,628 --> 00:47:31,229
Hello? Are you Hikaru?

874
00:47:31,628 --> 00:47:32,901
Oh Dad

875
00:47:33,197 --> 00:47:35,744
Where are you playing at?
Come back home soon

876
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:39,025
It's late.
Can I stay at friend's house?

877
00:47:39,472 --> 00:47:41,050
Who's house?

878
00:47:41,246 --> 00:47:42,082
At Aikawa's

879
00:47:42,566 --> 00:47:44,535
What? Aikawa's house?

880
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,606
I will talk with him

881
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:46,739
Wait a min

882
00:47:49,474 --> 00:47:52,700
Hello? You shouldn't stay at his house

883
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,078
Why I can't

884
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:57,687
You can't any way, go home right now

885
00:47:59,923 --> 00:48:01,407
Hello? Hikaru! Hello!

886
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,431
I have no choice...

887
00:48:04,485 --> 00:48:06,321
Can you tell me Aikawa's phone number?

888
00:48:06,485 --> 00:48:07,017
Wait

889
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,080
Hello? This is Aikawa residence

890
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:23,866
Please wait a min

891
00:48:26,702 --> 00:48:29,077
Hello? oh, you

892
00:48:30,217 --> 00:48:31,420
What can I do for you?

893
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:35,162
No, Ichiro has also not come home yet

894
00:48:35,615 --> 00:48:37,326
So He was calling me outside

895
00:48:37,914 --> 00:48:40,718
My brother said on the phone he will stay there tonight

896
00:48:41,312 --> 00:48:43,773
You can kick him out if he visit you

897
00:49:50,433 --> 00:49:52,339
I thought he has come back home

898
00:49:53,034 --> 00:49:54,323
It's too late

899
00:49:55,058 --> 00:49:57,198
Ask her when he left there

900
00:49:57,852 --> 00:49:59,062
But it's mid night

901
00:49:59,578 --> 00:50:02,180
The trouble is mutual.
I will call them

902
00:50:02,234 --> 00:50:02,844
Um

903
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:06,468
I think I go to bed now

904
00:50:07,062 --> 00:50:11,593
No smart people will come from this man

905
00:50:11,979 --> 00:50:12,869
You are kidding

906
00:50:15,393 --> 00:50:17,260
Boys take after their mothers

907
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:19,245
Yes I see

908
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:22,540
No, he has not come here

909
00:50:23,704 --> 00:50:26,383
Hun, My brother came home alone, and he is sleeping now

910
00:50:26,922 --> 00:50:29,032
Then I will wake him up and ask him

911
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm sorry to disturb you

912
00:50:31,203 --> 00:50:31,828
What they said?

913
00:50:32,047 --> 00:50:33,992
Ichiro is on the phone

914
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:38,441
Hello?

915
00:50:38,754 --> 00:50:39,480
Are you Ichiro-kun?

916
00:50:39,629 --> 00:50:40,964
Yes, you are brother,aren't you?

917
00:50:41,465 --> 00:50:43,090
Did Hikaru say anything when you are separate?

918
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,746
He was very angry after calling you

919
00:50:46,449 --> 00:50:47,793
He said my brother is too bad

920
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:48,567
Right

921
00:50:48,981 --> 00:50:50,606
Your sister is bad

922
00:50:51,356 --> 00:50:53,043
My sister scold me too

923
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:54,942
Why do you have to say that

924
00:50:55,692 --> 00:50:56,911
So you separated each other

925
00:50:57,395 --> 00:51:00,012
He said he return home right away, and asked me to borrow some money

926
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:03,312
I feel strange but I owed him money.

927
00:51:03,594 --> 00:51:04,329
How much did you owe?

928
00:51:04,446 --> 00:51:05,250
It's 300 yen

929
00:51:05,711 --> 00:51:07,790
Do you know where he went to stay?

930
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,563
Well... I have no idea besides our house

931
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,777
I will talk with him

932
00:51:13,527 --> 00:51:15,433
Hello?It's me

933
00:51:15,861 --> 00:51:17,955
What did you say to my brother?

934
00:51:18,307 --> 00:51:19,814
It's my business

935
00:51:20,611 --> 00:51:22,502
I've gotten a lot of complaints from you

936
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:26,273
You destroyed the friendship between my brother and your brother

937
00:51:27,226 --> 00:51:30,437
If anything happens to my brother,
 I'll have your parents take the blame

938
00:51:35,007 --> 00:51:36,343
If anything happens to his brother...

939
00:51:36,913 --> 00:51:38,593
Because of what you said to Yamada's brother

940
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,406
Because you don't study much

941
00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:43,143
I told you I will stop boxing next year

942
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:44,667
You should have acted sooner

943
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,424
I can't study calmly in this house

944
00:51:47,033 --> 00:51:49,517
There's no one to talk to in this house, no one to support me

945
00:51:50,619 --> 00:51:52,392
I think Yamada feels same with me.
He's gonna die

946
00:51:57,429 --> 00:51:59,421
He's gonna die..You're exaggerating

947
00:52:00,194 --> 00:52:02,709
He doesn't need to ask my parents.
He and his brother are not good people

948
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:05,428
His father's not a good man either

949
00:52:29,948 --> 00:52:32,261
Hello? Yes , this is Yamada residence

950
00:52:33,605 --> 00:52:36,098
Yes, please wait a min

951
00:52:36,511 --> 00:52:39,426
He is sleeping as he went back home late last night

952
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:40,980
I will wake him up

953
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:48,160
There is a phone call from Atami

954
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,363
I see

955
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:06,233
Hello? Are you Kiyo-Chan?

956
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:08,803
It was terrible last night

957
00:53:11,092 --> 00:53:12,701
Please come in, wait a min

958
00:53:22,807 --> 00:53:23,283
Yes

959
00:53:24,151 --> 00:53:26,307
Aikawa-kun is here with his sister

960
00:53:27,158 --> 00:53:27,947
I see

961
00:53:29,297 --> 00:53:30,258
I'm awake completely

962
00:53:32,539 --> 00:53:34,531
Hikaru is with her in Atami?

963
00:53:34,742 --> 00:53:36,484
Anyway Please ring him up

964
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:38,500
He is in

965
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:46,122
What are you doing?

966
00:53:46,551 --> 00:53:49,996
Why you didn't call us if you stay at Atami last night?

967
00:53:51,502 --> 00:53:54,526
I couldn't sleep well as I worried about you

968
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:57,836
I couldn't sleep either because I was afraid to sleep alone in my room

969
00:53:59,086 --> 00:54:01,047
This person woke me up just before

970
00:54:02,999 --> 00:54:04,944
I was angry with my brother

971
00:54:05,577 --> 00:54:07,968
I thought she took care of me even though I have no money

972
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,364
Yes...yes

973
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:14,451
Welcome, oh Ichiro-kun

974
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,287
My brother is on the phone, so don't worry

975
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:17,249
Oh he is!

976
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:19,967
Where was he?

977
00:54:20,053 --> 00:54:21,014
Anyway take your seats

978
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:24,349
Where he is calling from?

979
00:54:24,623 --> 00:54:25,240
From Atami

980
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:26,209
Atami?

981
00:54:26,748 --> 00:54:28,388
He was relaxing in the spa

982
00:54:28,794 --> 00:54:30,841
Your brother's a real rock

983
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:32,709
He's got a good point

984
00:54:33,276 --> 00:54:35,909
My head hurts from lack of sleep because of it

985
00:54:36,550 --> 00:54:38,097
You worried for us?

986
00:54:38,667 --> 00:54:40,526
Of course, Because you threatened me

987
00:54:40,908 --> 00:54:41,385
You're overreacting

988
00:54:41,971 --> 00:54:43,416
Of course,I worried about you

989
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,494
It's not funny

990
00:54:46,708 --> 00:54:49,505
My father will pick me up by car so you can come with him

991
00:54:50,482 --> 00:54:51,396
I'm waiting for you

992
00:55:04,642 --> 00:55:08,743
I'm sorry I can't send you until Tokyo,
It's faster if you take train from Yokohama

993
00:55:09,361 --> 00:55:11,799
I hate to say this after you sent me home, but...

994
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:16,400
I didn't really want Ichiro to go to Atami

995
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:17,857
Why is that?

996
00:55:19,138 --> 00:55:20,935
A person from Kyoto will come

997
00:55:23,781 --> 00:55:26,125
I couldn't say he doesn't have to go

998
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,835
You should say it

999
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:48,182
Oh, where are you going?

1000
00:55:48,892 --> 00:55:50,360
I'm upset so I have no idea where to go

1001
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:51,962
You are kidding

1002
00:55:52,017 --> 00:55:52,907
I'm not kidding

1003
00:55:53,313 --> 00:55:54,688
I don't sleep well

1004
00:55:54,998 --> 00:55:56,474
I don't know what happened if I speed up

1005
00:55:56,896 --> 00:55:58,834
I'm disgust with you,
Where are you going?

1006
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:07,380
Stop here

1007
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:08,903
The car will be stop if I crash

1008
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:10,176
Ah!

1009
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:14,016
You are too bad!
You're a thief!

1010
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:16,828
I am brother of Hikaru

1011
00:56:19,969 --> 00:56:21,414
Why you stopped here?

1012
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:24,701
I don't need a pretty landscape to talk to you

1013
00:56:25,451 --> 00:56:26,709
I don't want to talk with you

1014
00:56:30,055 --> 00:56:31,156
You are too selfish!

1015
00:56:31,539 --> 00:56:32,930
You insulted me

1016
00:56:33,172 --> 00:56:34,836
Let go of me, please,
Otherwise I will shout

1017
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:35,875
Help!

1018
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:37,823
Please help me!

1019
00:56:44,436 --> 00:56:45,193
Please come in

1020
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,380
You are shameless!
You are so clumsy

1021
00:57:05,638 --> 00:57:07,568
You can complain a lot

1022
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,521
It kept me awake

1023
00:57:10,091 --> 00:57:11,161
I don't want to talk with you

1024
00:57:11,425 --> 00:57:13,050
Please take a nap

1025
00:57:13,285 --> 00:57:14,629
It will take a long time

1026
00:57:15,043 --> 00:57:16,410
You don't have to drive to Tokyo

1027
00:57:17,113 --> 00:57:18,848
I won't drive to Tokyo but Atami

1028
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,277
Oh you!

1029
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:26,708
If you worry about your brother, you should go to pick him up

1030
00:57:27,348 --> 00:57:28,325
Yes I worry about him

1031
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:31,447
Your father was upstairs in our restaurant holding the hand of a woman

1032
00:57:32,306 --> 00:57:33,681
How can people let their child see such a scene?

1033
00:57:34,158 --> 00:57:35,509
That's OK they love each other

1034
00:57:36,065 --> 00:57:37,033
I'm disgusted with you

1035
00:57:37,525 --> 00:57:39,721
I don't want my brother involved in your household

1036
00:57:40,143 --> 00:57:42,674
No problem, so I should bring him back, right?

1037
00:57:42,986 --> 00:57:44,205
Then you tied up him

1038
00:57:44,479 --> 00:57:45,392
Mind your own business

1039
00:57:46,182 --> 00:57:47,135
He is pity

1040
00:57:47,408 --> 00:57:51,111
My brother and Ichiro are both loved by their siblings

1041
00:57:51,690 --> 00:57:53,214
Our love will mean nothing

1042
00:57:53,901 --> 00:57:55,697
I'm in trouble

1043
00:57:56,503 --> 00:57:57,479
I'm the one in trouble

1044
00:57:57,768 --> 00:57:58,486
It's me

1045
00:58:15,834 --> 00:58:17,443
Here is good place, shall we take a rest?

1046
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,552
You can if you are tired

1047
00:58:20,677 --> 00:58:21,927
Then I will smoke

1048
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:42,321
I want to smoke

1049
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,141
Here is it

1050
00:58:45,672 --> 00:58:46,782
I rarely smoke

1051
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:53,930
Women smoke when they're in a bad mood

1052
00:58:56,134 --> 00:58:56,923
You think so?

1053
00:58:58,392 --> 00:59:00,720
No,I'm not in bad mood

1054
00:59:03,547 --> 00:59:07,594
But you are bored I think, because you need to take care of drunker for your work

1055
00:59:09,235 --> 00:59:10,906
Drunks are innocent

1056
00:59:11,422 --> 00:59:12,110
You think so?

1057
00:59:12,899 --> 00:59:15,149
People like me and my father are bad?

1058
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:17,664
It's our business

1059
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,793
That would be fine

1060
00:59:20,012 --> 00:59:22,699
But sometime you should take a rest

1061
00:59:26,372 --> 00:59:27,903
Views like this are rare

1062
00:59:29,958 --> 00:59:31,872
How do you think?
It's very nice, isn't it?

1063
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:34,292
I don't need beautiful scenery

1064
00:59:34,722 --> 00:59:35,792
I think You need it

1065
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,573
If you look closely, the view is nice

1066
00:59:37,698 --> 00:59:39,316
Me or Mt.Fuji?

1067
00:59:40,696 --> 00:59:42,368
The moon is in the east, the sun is in the west

1068
00:59:43,001 --> 00:59:44,032
What a beautiful

1069
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,587
You are like bad guy

1070
00:59:48,517 --> 00:59:50,837
You make everything but yourself look bad

1071
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,275
So let's hurry up

1072
01:00:25,776 --> 01:00:27,245
What a nice sea, isn't it!

1073
01:00:27,315 --> 01:00:28,425
It's lovely color

1074
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:35,956
Please stop here

1075
01:00:50,894 --> 01:00:52,902
Ah....

1076
01:01:04,343 --> 01:01:05,163
Please

1077
01:01:05,624 --> 01:01:06,444
No thank you

1078
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:07,155
Then...

1079
01:01:10,374 --> 01:01:14,171
As Atami approaches, I don't want to go

1080
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:15,803
What?

1081
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:18,464
Let's go home

1082
01:01:18,964 --> 01:01:21,190
Atami is there, It's soon

1083
01:01:23,034 --> 01:01:24,948
They are having fun, I don't want to bother them

1084
01:01:25,316 --> 01:01:28,191
I can't take him out to play when he's out of school

1085
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:30,394
That's bad

1086
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:32,955
That's bad, but I will let him play today

1087
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,041
Ah.. I also want to let him play today

1088
01:01:36,517 --> 01:01:37,541
You are sleepy, right?

1089
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,400
I've been worried about my brother until now

1090
01:01:41,081 --> 01:01:42,589
I wasn't looking at you

1091
01:01:43,425 --> 01:01:44,581
You were not looking at me too?

1092
01:01:45,894 --> 01:01:47,675
I was not at all

1093
01:01:48,832 --> 01:01:50,012
You don't get it, do you?

1094
01:01:50,832 --> 01:01:51,668
What do you mean?

1095
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,621
You don't know how beautiful are you

1096
01:01:56,535 --> 01:01:59,442
I've heard a lot of compliments in my store

1097
01:02:00,934 --> 01:02:02,825
That made you your bad character

1098
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:06,322
You can't understand real words

1099
01:02:07,158 --> 01:02:08,634
So What do you want to say?

1100
01:02:09,376 --> 01:02:11,486
Well.. I am...in short...

1101
01:02:13,595 --> 01:02:14,634
Anyway Please get in the car

1102
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:16,486
Let's go home friendly

1103
01:02:22,814 --> 01:02:23,322
Please

1104
01:02:24,244 --> 01:02:25,103
Back seat would be fine with me

1105
01:02:57,308 --> 01:02:59,715
Oh There is a castle over there

1106
01:03:00,269 --> 01:03:02,035
That's Odawara castle.
Shall we go to see it?

1107
01:03:02,809 --> 01:03:04,832
Don't worry.
This is not sightseeing

1108
01:03:05,207 --> 01:03:06,887
Mt.Fuji or a castle

1109
01:03:07,219 --> 01:03:07,859
Oh, yeah!

1110
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:10,914
Odawara's eel is delicious. Shall we eat?

1111
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:14,133
I'd rather not to eat eel...

1112
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:17,546
So we can't go.
Eels have a habit of cheating on their parents

1113
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:20,570
You are funny guy more than I thought

1114
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:22,023
Yes I am

1115
01:03:22,351 --> 01:03:24,195
Don't look behind you. It's dangerous

1116
01:03:25,718 --> 01:03:27,851
Nice drive, thanks to my brother

1117
01:04:29,319 --> 01:04:42,639
(singing)

1118
01:04:43,299 --> 01:04:44,846
Costumers here

1119
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,640
(singing)

1120
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,843
Please come in

1121
01:04:54,288 --> 01:04:56,718
(singing)

1122
01:04:56,743 --> 01:04:58,944
Who is it?

1123
01:05:00,835 --> 01:05:01,593
You must be tired

1124
01:05:01,741 --> 01:05:02,858
You too

1125
01:05:03,710 --> 01:05:05,132
I'm hungry

1126
01:05:05,538 --> 01:05:06,499
I will order something

1127
01:05:06,561 --> 01:05:07,538
Make yourself at home

1128
01:05:08,545 --> 01:05:09,483
Oh you

1129
01:05:13,022 --> 01:05:13,936
Welcome

1130
01:05:14,249 --> 01:05:14,975
Thank you for having me

1131
01:05:15,819 --> 01:05:17,288
Thank you always for taking care of my brother

1132
01:05:17,936 --> 01:05:19,100
Who is the brother?

1133
01:05:19,201 --> 01:05:20,732
Ichiro's friend,Yamada

1134
01:05:20,929 --> 01:05:22,585
Oh..that's bad friend

1135
01:05:23,249 --> 01:05:24,866
I'm the brother

1136
01:05:25,077 --> 01:05:26,272
Anyway welcome

1137
01:05:26,576 --> 01:05:28,052
Thank you for always coming

1138
01:05:28,115 --> 01:05:29,810
Please make a tea for him right away

1139
01:05:29,873 --> 01:05:30,584
OKOK

1140
01:05:31,154 --> 01:05:32,131
Please make yourself at home

1141
01:05:35,240 --> 01:05:36,287
What would you like to eat?

1142
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:37,787
Anything OK with me

1143
01:05:38,045 --> 01:05:39,248
How about eel?

1144
01:05:39,576 --> 01:05:41,092
No.. more sexy one

1145
01:05:45,037 --> 01:05:45,638
Who is it?

1146
01:05:46,115 --> 01:05:46,982
Good man

1147
01:05:47,506 --> 01:05:48,185
He can be her husband?

1148
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,131
No good, no good

1149
01:05:49,732 --> 01:05:50,967
That bad guy...

1150
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:52,982
Ichiro's friend who got into trouble last night

1151
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:54,529
He is the brother

1152
01:05:54,935 --> 01:05:56,076
It's good if he is the brother

1153
01:05:56,201 --> 01:05:58,310
He can't.
Mikako is so upset

1154
01:05:58,935 --> 01:05:59,662
You stupid

1155
01:06:00,162 --> 01:06:03,006
You don't know a woman's mind

1156
01:06:03,631 --> 01:06:04,342
I will go to see him

1157
01:06:04,607 --> 01:06:06,092
Bring that tea

1158
01:06:06,928 --> 01:06:07,967
Take me some plates

1159
01:06:18,498 --> 01:06:19,779
Please come this way

1160
01:06:20,779 --> 01:06:21,911
Give him a hand towel

1161
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:22,466
I get it

1162
01:06:22,748 --> 01:06:23,904
Give me a salt

1163
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,122
Oh..Thank you for having me

1164
01:06:49,263 --> 01:06:50,209
Yo

1165
01:06:50,568 --> 01:06:52,076
Keep relaxing

1166
01:06:54,099 --> 01:06:55,748
Thank you for coming

1167
01:06:56,115 --> 01:06:57,888
Thank you for always coming

1168
01:06:58,256 --> 01:07:00,576
Not at all.
Sorry that my brother makes you trouble

1169
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:05,912
Never mind.
Our daughter is strong-minded

1170
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:08,388
I'm afraid my brother has a bad reputation

1171
01:07:09,060 --> 01:07:12,248
My daughter has a good reputation but

1172
01:07:13,037 --> 01:07:14,982
No man wants to marry her

1173
01:07:15,693 --> 01:07:18,053
She looks like a sellout

1174
01:07:18,763 --> 01:07:21,928
Her bad character is like her mother's.

1175
01:07:22,404 --> 01:07:23,935
Her good character is like me

1176
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:25,185
What are you saying?

1177
01:07:26,263 --> 01:07:28,881
Anyway please be relaxing

1178
01:07:29,912 --> 01:07:31,709
Young men and women are good.

1179
01:07:36,967 --> 01:07:38,748
He's doing well.
Little crazy

1180
01:07:39,325 --> 01:07:39,864
Please take it

1181
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:43,154
(singing)

1182
01:07:43,959 --> 01:07:44,943
How was it?

1183
01:07:45,131 --> 01:07:47,615
It's love at first sight.
I'm glad

1184
01:07:47,685 --> 01:07:48,873
Not you

1185
01:07:49,326 --> 01:07:50,396
Do you think Mikako likes him?

1186
01:07:50,553 --> 01:07:53,107
I don't know it now

1187
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:58,521
I have a lot of trouble with that

1188
01:07:59,834 --> 01:08:02,224
I'm my brother's educator

1189
01:08:03,381 --> 01:08:05,107
I also like my brother

1190
01:08:06,443 --> 01:08:09,701
I was a freshman in high school when my mother died

1191
01:08:10,709 --> 01:08:13,224
He was still in elementary school and I felt so bad for him

1192
01:08:14,826 --> 01:08:17,217
Luckily,That maid has come back

1193
01:08:17,763 --> 01:08:21,670
I know how you feel.
He's going through a difficult time right now

1194
01:08:22,506 --> 01:08:25,162
I took the opportunity to come here today so

1195
01:08:25,873 --> 01:08:28,217
Be patient with your brother

1196
01:08:28,912 --> 01:08:30,092
My father and I too

1197
01:08:30,959 --> 01:08:33,560
I may have said too much

1198
01:08:34,045 --> 01:08:35,217
So do I

1199
01:08:35,982 --> 01:08:40,295
From now on, let's cooperate with each other and talk about our brother

1200
01:08:41,021 --> 01:08:41,928
Yes true

1201
01:08:42,295 --> 01:08:43,451
Let's shake hands

1202
01:08:47,115 --> 01:08:47,896
Mikako

1203
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:51,396
There was a call from Atami

1204
01:08:51,576 --> 01:08:52,185
What he said?

1205
01:08:52,842 --> 01:08:55,193
He said he'll go to Kyoto from Arami directly

1206
01:08:55,787 --> 01:08:56,303
To Kyoto?

1207
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:57,732
No way, he can't

1208
01:08:58,287 --> 01:08:59,357
Did you hang up the phone?

1209
01:08:59,818 --> 01:09:00,904
Yes

1210
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:02,748
Please call him right away

1211
01:09:03,834 --> 01:09:06,709
He didn't ask me the permission?

1212
01:09:07,045 --> 01:09:11,302
He said he will study from next year, so I will go to Kyoto

1213
01:09:11,896 --> 01:09:13,193
Then what did you say?

1214
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:15,779
I told him Kyoto is nice place, you can go

1215
01:09:16,318 --> 01:09:18,451
No wonder he hung up

1216
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,045
Did he say he goes with everyone?

1217
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:20,904
Maybe

1218
01:09:21,217 --> 01:09:23,826
This is why I don't like him. He's a softy

1219
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:25,678
Our father is same too

1220
01:09:25,756 --> 01:09:26,834
I don't like it

1221
01:09:27,451 --> 01:09:30,756
Your father staying with that woman and flirting with her is disgusting

1222
01:09:31,459 --> 01:09:32,467
He holds her hands

1223
01:09:32,959 --> 01:09:34,349
We just held hands

1224
01:09:34,451 --> 01:09:35,513
I forget it

1225
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:38,678
I see, then I will go to call him

1226
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:40,123
Where is the phone?

1227
01:09:40,646 --> 01:09:41,615
There

1228
01:09:45,771 --> 01:09:47,232
It's nice to be in Kyoto at end of year

1229
01:09:47,310 --> 01:09:48,568
You idiot

1230
01:09:55,474 --> 01:09:56,553
She is crazy

1231
01:10:04,865 --> 01:10:06,490
Hello?
Are you Minamijien?

1232
01:10:07,162 --> 01:10:09,131
I'm Yamada speaking, can you call my father?

1233
01:10:21,959 --> 01:10:23,326
He said they will return?

1234
01:10:23,685 --> 01:10:25,256
I'm going to Kyoto from now

1235
01:10:26,248 --> 01:10:27,459
They have left already?

1236
01:10:27,771 --> 01:10:29,849
He probably called right before he left because he thought he'd get scolded

1237
01:10:30,428 --> 01:10:31,646
I hear they have just left

1238
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:33,662
I hate that about your father

1239
01:10:34,037 --> 01:10:37,123
Your father took my brother to Kyoto without permission

1240
01:10:37,482 --> 01:10:39,349
That's my father's strength

1241
01:10:40,451 --> 01:10:43,576
He doesn't bother to call for permission when the kids are happy

1242
01:10:45,123 --> 01:10:47,513
Of course, I love that father of mine

1243
01:10:48,326 --> 01:10:50,146
I'm going to play in Kyoto too.
Thanks to my father

1244
01:10:56,092 --> 01:10:59,303
Hello? Can you send there if you go home by car?

1245
01:10:59,396 --> 01:11:00,607
Sure, I will send you to Ginza

1246
01:11:00,771 --> 01:11:01,763
Dad!

1247
01:11:03,584 --> 01:11:04,201
Ouch!

1248
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:06,240
You hit my face...

1249
01:11:06,412 --> 01:11:07,873
You're too stingy with the cab fare.

1250
01:11:08,076 --> 01:11:08,670
You are stupid

1251
01:11:18,451 --> 01:11:19,365
I feel regret

1252
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:36,982
Ichiro can write good

1253
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:38,740
Of course, he goes to school

1254
01:11:39,170 --> 01:11:40,928
If he can write like this, he's better than me

1255
01:11:41,256 --> 01:11:43,670
He's better than your father, but there's always a better way

1256
01:11:43,943 --> 01:11:44,842
Is there anything lower than me?

1257
01:11:45,225 --> 01:11:46,318
There is no

1258
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,201
He's a wonderful son, we can tell

1259
01:11:49,678 --> 01:11:52,483
I'm the worst, but I'm still running this business

1260
01:11:52,592 --> 01:11:55,404
If he ran this place, it would be much bigger

1261
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:56,983
I supported you so your business was a success

1262
01:11:57,240 --> 01:12:02,193
Ha, If you hadn't interfered, this place would have been a building

1263
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:04,936
Then would you work in the basement cafeteria?

1264
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:07,545
You're a toilet cleaner.

1265
01:12:07,858 --> 01:12:10,811
Both of you talk so much.
Could you keep your voice down?

1266
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,608
I'm busy on December 31st.
 I can't shut up

1267
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:16,764
I have to work with my mouth and my hands

1268
01:12:18,115 --> 01:12:22,108
You're quietly thinking of Kyoto

1269
01:12:22,826 --> 01:12:25,490
If you want to go, you can go.
No one will complain

1270
01:12:26,412 --> 01:12:28,107
I haven't say I want to go

1271
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:31,177
so I don't have to worry about men playing with you, though

1272
01:12:31,755 --> 01:12:33,427
I get a lot of marriage offers for you

1273
01:12:34,521 --> 01:12:37,818
Playboy, yakuza, son of a gangster

1274
01:12:39,490 --> 01:12:41,341
Thanks to you, this store has a good reputation

1275
01:12:41,466 --> 01:12:42,591
Don't you think so?

1276
01:12:43,021 --> 01:12:46,013
Ok, shall we go back work?

1277
01:12:46,091 --> 01:12:47,114
I will ready

1278
01:12:53,753 --> 01:12:55,362
Hello? Yes yes

1279
01:12:55,503 --> 01:12:58,706
Yes right, Could you wait a min?

1280
01:12:59,183 --> 01:13:00,823
Someone is calling you from Kyoto

1281
01:13:06,933 --> 01:13:07,901
Hello?

1282
01:13:08,644 --> 01:13:09,722
Are you Ichiro?

1283
01:13:10,284 --> 01:13:11,753
What are you doing?

1284
01:13:12,269 --> 01:13:13,800
What? a Picture card?

1285
01:13:14,534 --> 01:13:16,034
I received as it was express mail

1286
01:13:16,651 --> 01:13:17,370
Yes

1287
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,026
Then Yamada's dad has returned home

1288
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:21,565
I see

1289
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:24,003
So when are you going home?

1290
01:13:24,604 --> 01:13:25,386
What?

1291
01:13:25,769 --> 01:13:27,534
Will you go home on New Year's Day after hearing the New Year's bell?

1292
01:13:27,839 --> 01:13:28,651
Yes

1293
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:29,643
Yes

1294
01:13:29,925 --> 01:13:32,081
That's good hearing the New Year's bell in Kyoto

1295
01:13:32,519 --> 01:13:33,472
Are you Yamada-san?

1296
01:13:33,979 --> 01:13:34,339
See?

1297
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:34,924
Yes

1298
01:13:34,948 --> 01:13:36,214
Her voice is different

1299
01:13:37,370 --> 01:13:38,995
Thank you for taking care of my brother

1300
01:13:39,808 --> 01:13:42,589
Eh? Ah..Lighter

1301
01:13:43,073 --> 01:13:44,237
Yes There is

1302
01:13:45,144 --> 01:13:45,636
Eh?

1303
01:13:47,464 --> 01:13:49,714
Ah, I see

1304
01:13:49,987 --> 01:13:52,761
I thought that lighter was a gift from a girlfriend

1305
01:13:53,683 --> 01:13:55,394
Yes, I will keep it

1306
01:13:57,042 --> 01:13:59,769
Well..I will be busy tonight...

1307
01:13:59,948 --> 01:14:01,198
You don't have to worry about us

1308
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,925
Yes yes, then see you

1309
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,972
You are too simple

1310
01:14:09,909 --> 01:14:11,745
In thoughts, sexiness is outside

1311
01:14:21,698 --> 01:14:23,964
He said this lighter was a memento of his mother

1312
01:14:24,448 --> 01:14:26,769
You can go to Kyoto,Mikako

1313
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,167
I can't go at the new year's eve

1314
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:30,791
You don't need to be upset

1315
01:14:30,886 --> 01:14:31,925
I would be angry

1316
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:34,487
Too busy and frustrated

1317
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:37,261
I don't know why I'm getting old

1318
01:14:37,737 --> 01:14:41,144
So you go to Kyoto to think about your life

1319
01:14:42,019 --> 01:14:44,683
Gong Gong

1320
01:14:44,761 --> 01:14:47,112
Ichiro makes me worry all the time

1321
01:14:47,667 --> 01:14:49,714
It'll take your mind off your problems

1322
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:50,987
Gong

1323
01:14:51,050 --> 01:14:52,323
You are too noisy

1324
01:14:52,761 --> 01:14:54,550
If you'd rather I wasn't here, I'll go

1325
01:14:54,979 --> 01:14:57,136
I don't care both Ichito and this restaurant

1326
01:14:57,737 --> 01:14:59,690
Ok I will go to Kyoto

1327
01:15:00,097 --> 01:15:02,097
If I'm in the way, I'll go.
See you

1328
01:15:05,394 --> 01:15:07,558
Ha, I'm disgusted with her

1329
01:15:07,995 --> 01:15:11,300
She said she will go for us even though she goes to a guy who she loves

1330
01:15:27,675 --> 01:15:30,284
It seems no one is here..Door has not been locked

1331
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:33,683
Welcome back

1332
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,448
You should lock the door

1333
01:15:37,972 --> 01:15:39,894
I will go to Kyoto from now, so Please prepare my stuff

1334
01:15:41,651 --> 01:15:42,690
What's wrong?

1335
01:15:44,026 --> 01:15:45,847
I'm over

1336
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:48,792
It's strange that you cry,
You are a strong-minded woman

1337
01:15:49,589 --> 01:15:51,933
You misunderstand me.
I'm weak-minded

1338
01:15:53,808 --> 01:15:55,979
Some tea cakes are here.
Did you have a visitor?

1339
01:15:57,644 --> 01:15:58,378
He has left

1340
01:15:58,948 --> 01:15:59,558
Who?

1341
01:16:00,261 --> 01:16:01,558
That man came

1342
01:16:01,706 --> 01:16:02,464
That man?

1343
01:16:03,503 --> 01:16:05,847
The man in the drugstore you like

1344
01:16:06,330 --> 01:16:09,518
So Please listen to my story

1345
01:16:09,612 --> 01:16:11,159
I don't want to listen

1346
01:16:12,323 --> 01:16:14,573
That's too bad.
I feel sad

1347
01:16:15,058 --> 01:16:17,979
I will go to Kyoto.
I have no time

1348
01:16:18,081 --> 01:16:20,308
Go ahead.
Everyone is cold

1349
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:26,198
Talk to me now

1350
01:16:27,089 --> 01:16:28,511
I will say directly

1351
01:16:29,479 --> 01:16:31,354
I'm broken heart

1352
01:16:32,183 --> 01:16:33,112
You were serious with me?

1353
01:16:34,214 --> 01:16:35,245
Excuse me

1354
01:16:35,761 --> 01:16:39,362
People like you have no idea how I feel

1355
01:16:39,701 --> 01:16:42,381
You are excuse.
So What happen?

1356
01:16:43,185 --> 01:16:47,646
Actually he said he wants to talk with me something

1357
01:16:48,724 --> 01:16:51,013
That man is called Yoshio, Good name isn't it?

1358
01:16:51,060 --> 01:16:52,599
Then The Yoshio did what?

1359
01:16:52,904 --> 01:16:54,654
Please listen to me

1360
01:16:54,717 --> 01:16:55,803
I'm listening

1361
01:16:56,935 --> 01:16:59,013
My heart was beating

1362
01:16:59,881 --> 01:17:02,170
It's the first time in my life

1363
01:17:02,717 --> 01:17:04,084
You'll have to guess

1364
01:17:04,240 --> 01:17:05,122
I will

1365
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,756
So he came here

1366
01:17:07,248 --> 01:17:08,810
There was just no one here

1367
01:17:09,349 --> 01:17:11,396
I served him tea and sweets

1368
01:17:13,357 --> 01:17:15,928
He left without eating anything

1369
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,342
Please eat if you like

1370
01:17:21,381 --> 01:17:23,498
You've been lied to, haven't you?

1371
01:17:23,771 --> 01:17:25,201
No, No way!

1372
01:17:25,795 --> 01:17:28,279
He was serious and proposed me

1373
01:17:28,498 --> 01:17:30,029
That's good for you

1374
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:32,787
It is not good at all

1375
01:17:33,739 --> 01:17:37,224
Yoshio's father has no wife now

1376
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:40,943
so Yoshio asked me to marry his father

1377
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:42,717
With his father

1378
01:17:43,381 --> 01:17:44,482
How old is Yoshio?

1379
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:45,200
20

1380
01:17:45,998 --> 01:17:46,810
Still 20

1381
01:17:47,303 --> 01:17:48,724
I'm a sissy wife type

1382
01:17:49,131 --> 01:17:50,131
That's ridiculous

1383
01:17:50,459 --> 01:17:51,951
Don't cry and help me

1384
01:17:52,193 --> 01:17:53,467
Today is last day in this year

1385
01:17:53,834 --> 01:17:55,506
You can find better man next year

1386
01:17:55,888 --> 01:17:57,428
Well, I have no time

1387
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,872
I want to go somewhere too

1388
01:18:20,544 --> 01:18:22,067
You liked Yoshio so much

1389
01:18:23,153 --> 01:18:25,442
It's more than I like

1390
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:28,676
But I will forget him

1391
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:32,700
Tomorrow, a new year

1392
01:18:33,247 --> 01:18:35,309
I'll start over with a fresh mind

1393
01:18:36,020 --> 01:18:38,895
You are saying right.
I'll start over with a fresh mind too

1394
01:18:40,372 --> 01:18:41,958
Is anyone nice in Kyoto?

1395
01:18:42,192 --> 01:18:44,051
Yes there is anyone nice in Kyoto

1396
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,458
Get the toiletries ready

1397
01:18:45,575 --> 01:18:49,801
Please introduce me to someone.
Because it's a new year

1398
01:19:59,145 --> 01:19:59,942
My brother's gone somewhere

1399
01:20:00,122 --> 01:20:01,317
He's going to talk to someone, isn't he?

1400
01:20:01,614 --> 01:20:02,544
He is young so

1401
01:20:02,778 --> 01:20:04,044
Are they not here?

1402
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,426
They want to be alone

1403
01:20:07,387 --> 01:20:10,317
Let's go to the bell tower.
I'm sure they'll be there

1404
01:20:17,911 --> 01:20:22,590
I don't think you'll like my father's relationship with Kyoko

1405
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:24,809
I think it's OK

1406
01:20:25,692 --> 01:20:29,458
After my mother died, my father didn't allow any women in the house for us

1407
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:33,879
It would be nice for my father to have a girlfriend out there

1408
01:20:35,379 --> 01:20:38,958
Just as there is love for us,
there can be love for our lonely father

1409
01:20:40,122 --> 01:20:43,738
Just as there is freedom for us,
there can be freedom for your lonely father

1410
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,356
I'm glad you understand that

1411
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:48,153
Let's shake hands

1412
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:52,989
The bells are starting to ring

1413
01:20:53,356 --> 01:20:54,653
It's finally a new year

1414
01:21:40,754 --> 01:21:42,504
This is the year I'm going to take on the seniors

1415
01:21:43,981 --> 01:21:45,036
Knock them out!

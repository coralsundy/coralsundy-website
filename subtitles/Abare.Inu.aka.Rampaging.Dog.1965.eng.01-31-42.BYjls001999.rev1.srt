00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:26,921
Having too much free time and money can be tough, but having free time without any money is even worse.

00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:40,199
Abare Inu / Rampaging Dog (1965)
(Inu/Dog Series #4)

4
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:08,257
I want to introduce the woman in this window

5
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:09,438
But I won't.

6
00:01:09,656 --> 00:01:10,883
She is not so beautiful.

7
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,820
People who have free time do careless things

8
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,015
so please forgive me

9
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,165
I'll have no free time soon

10
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:40,421
No,G

11
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,828
G?
What's that?

12
00:02:43,233 --> 00:02:45,976
it's going to be something naughty, right? Naughty...

13
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,117
just a little more naughty, huh?

14
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,133
That's a clever way to say it.

15
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,437
Well, after sex comes love, right?

16
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,516
After H comes love.

17
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,756
it's 'ai', isn't it? That's right,

18
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,765
it's 'ai', as in affection.

19
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:57,465
oh I see

20
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,836
I wonder if I'll have some free time soon

21
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,742
You know, I have a little something to consult with you about

22
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:07,082
Could you become my guarantor?

23
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,180
A guarantor?

24
00:03:08,395 --> 00:03:09,501
What will you do?

25
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,578
I'm thinking of becoming a singer at that high-end club, you know?

26
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,546
And I need one guarantor

27
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,656
Is it okay if I write it as Daisuke Kamoi?

28
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,125
just use my name when you need it,

29
00:03:19,507 --> 00:03:20,406
and my current address is...

30
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,396
It's the place called Rakuraku,

31
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,281
just after you turn at Yokochi over there

32
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:23,961
Thanks.

33
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:28,398
Oh you are here

34
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:30,445
What's wrong?

35
00:03:30,492 --> 00:03:31,212
Something went wrong

36
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,045
Has someone started a fight with you?

37
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:34,078
No.

38
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:35,592
You were easily kicked out from RakuRaku apartment.

39
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,384
What do you mean ?I was kicked out?

40
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:43,382
The address I gave you earlier will be changed.
See you.

41
00:03:44,395 --> 00:03:46,062
He is unreliable.

42
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,156
Dad, what are you doing?

43
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,347
Wake up.

44
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,666
Come on, come on,

45
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:00,566
what are you complaining about?

46
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:03,590
If you keep doing that, I'll stick the iron on your face

47
00:04:03,645 --> 00:04:04,804
Please don't be so angry

48
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,867
This is my bed, and the blanket is mine,

49
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:10,863
so what are you talking about?

50
00:04:11,068 --> 00:04:11,904
If you're going to complain,

51
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:15,140
Pay your rent! You can say after paying 750 yen for 5 days

52
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,016
750 yen? You can't say that after I told you to pay;

53
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
it clearly says 100 yen per day on the front

54
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:22,390
I'm going to give you 500 yen for 5 days

55
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,226
Stop complaining and just do it

56
00:04:24,273 --> 00:04:26,390
Sleep over there?

57
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:28,828
Here?

58
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:32,835
Stay back.

59
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:35,007
Is this okay?

60
00:04:35,602 --> 00:04:36,563
Look, you can see, right?

61
00:04:36,843 --> 00:04:39,046
You're sticking out half your foot like that.

62
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:43,062
Is that so? If my foot is sticking out halfway, does that mean an extra 50 yen?

63
00:04:43,087 --> 00:04:43,906
Of course,

64
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:47,117
if you mess around, your foot will stick out, right?

65
00:04:47,142 --> 00:04:48,188
You're funny.

66
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,640
My long legs are not my fault

67
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:52,312
Are you really not going to pay?

68
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:53,016
I won't.

69
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,106
Are you not going to pay?

70
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,476
When you see someone's face, you should pay up

71
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,546
I can't pay.

72
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,046
Alright, can you stretch out your leg
a bit?

73
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:01,028
stretch out your leg,

74
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,886
Show me.

75
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,910
I'm going to cut off your long legs.

76
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,266
Don't be reckless, okay?

77
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,936
It's better to cut ties with you.

78
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,195
Come on, pay up the money

79
00:05:12,335 --> 00:05:13,484
You don't need to worry about the change

80
00:05:13,571 --> 00:05:14,928
I pay for him.

81
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,688
You should thank him

82
00:05:18,046 --> 00:05:20,445
Ah, thank you for this

83
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,977
You're annoying.

84
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:27,811
but I'm sorry about that.

85
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,500
I'll pay you back when I have the money,

86
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,656
but you can't even work because your health is bad

87
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:35,742
How do you have any money?

88
00:05:36,851 --> 00:05:39,015
Maybe you should go to the hospital?

89
00:05:39,406 --> 00:05:40,563
I have a wife.

90
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,484
but I haven't seen her since I came to visit

91
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,319
She's just a woman from a family that has been drifting along

92
00:05:47,383 --> 00:05:50,383
She's in Osaka for 15 days in 3 months.

93
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:52,414
She's paying you?

94
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,875
Can you sell this well for me?

95
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:00,382
I want to escape with her this money

96
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:03,797
Please.

97
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,593
It's my last hope

98
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:08,148
This is a very good pistol.

99
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,711
This is very pleasant to touch.

100
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:14,102
It would be great if you could sell this for around 30,000 yen.

101
00:06:16,315 --> 00:06:19,882
Hey, I've become to want this ! I fell in love at first sight,

102
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:24,156
Leave it to me.

103
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:43,863
Good evening.

104
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:48,023
Oh Daisuke Kamoi.

105
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:49,491
What?

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,379
How do you know my name?

107
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:57,289
What are you, looking like a cat? I've heard about you from Detective Kimura

108
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:58,817
I am Doi who work with Kimura.

109
00:06:59,316 --> 00:07:02,550
Kimura? Huh, that kid.

110
00:07:03,402 --> 00:07:06,979
I gave him a raise, but he didn't thank me.

111
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:09,074
That's because I don't know your address,

112
00:07:09,493 --> 00:07:11,158
can you tell me?

113
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,652
I can't do that,

114
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,986
Do you know about this pistol?

115
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:21,610
Recently, this has been smuggled.

116
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,559
I heard you were misbehaving.

117
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,617
I have no idea.

118
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,685
So why did you come here?

119
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,824
You appear by the scent of the pistol.

120
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:34,702
No way.

121
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,821
What are you doing

122
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,567
Let me read your palm.

123
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:44,201
you're quite a strange one.

124
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:46,895
it seems you're going to raise my salary again

125
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,040
Don't say bullshit.

126
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:51,365
If you want to raise your salary, you have to work for it yourself, you foolish person

127
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,240
I'd like to see your face too.

128
00:07:54,380 --> 00:08:02,325
You know, I came to this shop because I need a beautiful my wife

129
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,776
I wonder if there's someone like that.

130
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
You will be able to get a wife soon

131
00:08:07,963 --> 00:08:09,169
It really seems to be coming out like that

132
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:11,427
Don't act like that.

133
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,524
I'm going to sit down and come back again

134
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,586
You are scum.
Get out of here.

135
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:16,834
See you.

136
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:24,756
It seems pistols are widely available.

137
00:08:45,654 --> 00:08:48,654
what do you want?

138
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,906
Hayashi-san was taken out!

139
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,317
What?

140
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,897
He was so terrible.

141
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:56,944
He is such a ruthless person.

142
00:09:10,748 --> 00:09:12,125
What's wrong?

143
00:09:12,196 --> 00:09:13,732
Get a grip! Get a grip!

144
00:09:14,535 --> 00:09:15,175
Miyuki...

145
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,683
What?

146
00:09:15,786 --> 00:09:18,052
Miyuki... Shima Miyuki...

147
00:09:18,216 --> 00:09:19,036
Shima Miyuki?

148
00:09:19,612 --> 00:09:22,612
she's the stripper from Jujo Music

149
00:09:23,285 --> 00:09:24,452
Is she your lover?

150
00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:26,431
She's nice woman.

151
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,757
whatever, call police.

152
00:09:30,108 --> 00:09:31,721
Take care of him.

153
00:09:48,808 --> 00:09:49,682
It's so cold.

154
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,974
Oh she is

155
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,407
Are you Miyuki-chan, right?

156
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:03,372
You know, Hayashi got shot,

157
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:06,911
Yoshio?

158
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,056
Yoshio?

159
00:10:19,802 --> 00:10:20,955
Why you dead?

160
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,943
Why?

161
00:10:25,096 --> 00:10:26,540
He get taken out in one shot?

162
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:27,305
That's how it was.

163
00:10:27,685 --> 00:10:29,556
The heart was slightly displaced,

164
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,612
but the person was already quite weakened

165
00:10:32,377 --> 00:10:33,722
The bullet is still in his body?

166
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:35,318
I took it out.

167
00:10:35,823 --> 00:10:40,926
Based on the bullet's residual situation in the body, the police believe there is a distance of more than 15 meters.

168
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:43,535
A bullet cut at 15 meters?

169
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:48,722
He must be pro.

170
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,315
We're heading to the autopsy room.

171
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,601
Just wait a moment.

172
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:08,043
An autopsy is not something
you should be watching

173
00:11:11,433 --> 00:11:12,400
Yoshio.

174
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:17,106
Cry for me as if I were him.

175
00:11:19,255 --> 00:11:21,411
He was good man.

176
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,865
He was not good enough for his looks.

177
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,600
but he was kind.

178
00:11:27,223 --> 00:11:30,634
I also have a debt of gratitude of a thousand yen to him.

179
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,596
No way, it's not just a thousand yen

180
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,100
That guy left me something of much greater value, right?

181
00:11:37,859 --> 00:11:40,465
If that's the case, Miyuki-chan,

182
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:41,689
It's about you.

183
00:11:46,028 --> 00:11:47,074
Leave it to me.

184
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:51,117
See, no matter what happens, I'll protect you, you know

185
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,476
I will avenge him

186
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:00,882
Are you seducing her?

187
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,696
Just as my fortune-telling said,

188
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,853
it seems like you will have a wife.

189
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,189
You're quite the amusing one, aren't you?

190
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,720
Hayashi said he gave a pistol to you.

191
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,224
Don't doubt me.

192
00:12:16,157 --> 00:12:17,236
It's the same type with this.

193
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,269
So give me.

194
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:21,606
Your face tells that.

195
00:12:22,186 --> 00:12:23,473
You are annoying.

196
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:26,202
If I were to hold onto something like that,

197
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,881
I would return it to you in your stomach.

198
00:12:29,284 --> 00:12:30,344
You get it?

199
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,347
He is on the criminal list for smuggling handguns.

200
00:12:32,388 --> 00:12:33,148
I can't believe it.

201
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,593
Yoshio-san wouldn't do something like that

202
00:12:34,771 --> 00:12:35,645
I will inspect your belongings.

203
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,417
Wait a minute,Lady first.

204
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:47,274
Well, it's a bit too much.

205
00:12:47,358 --> 00:12:48,505
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,347
What are you doing?

207
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:52,024
Wait.

208
00:13:15,913 --> 00:13:18,191
Hmm, this area is nice, right?

209
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:20,895
Here.

210
00:13:22,128 --> 00:13:23,623
we go, hey, go over there,

211
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:24,865
What?

212
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:25,850
it's fine, just go

213
00:13:37,742 --> 00:13:38,730
Ah, raise your hand

214
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,807
Don't move.

215
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,387
Just stay still for now.

216
00:13:57,786 --> 00:13:58,633
From here.

217
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:47,281
Ugh, that's tough!

218
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,733
It's way better than what I made

219
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,705
what are you doing?

220
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:58,059
Come on

221
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,383
Take it.

222
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:04,550
I was so scary.

223
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:11,218
Hey, everyone,are you moving out?

224
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,056
Hey, brother, is Miyuki doing well?

225
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,246
She has no family.

226
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,488
please take good care of her

227
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,268
Where has Miyuki gone?

228
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:25,241
I heard that Yuri and you are taking care of Miyuki

229
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:25,942
Yuri?

230
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:26,787
Who?

231
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,234
So, do you not know anything about it?

232
00:15:29,567 --> 00:15:30,407
No.

233
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:34,000
In the northern nightclub tower, there is a girl named Yuri

234
00:15:34,025 --> 00:15:37,025
She's a bit of a fixer-upper in this world

235
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:38,267
She's relying on her

236
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:43,999
Yuri and she takes care of Miyuki with you.

237
00:15:45,397 --> 00:15:46,838
In the northern nightclub tower

238
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:48,577
Ok.

239
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:49,584
Are you going there?

240
00:15:49,926 --> 00:15:50,719
Yes.

241
00:15:50,744 --> 00:15:52,050
They are expensive club.

242
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:55,262
Whatever it is, I'll use my name.

243
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:59,972
Everyone, take care not to catch a cold and live happily. Goodbye.

244
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,246
Welcome.

245
00:16:10,256 --> 00:16:10,863
Please

246
00:16:20,168 --> 00:16:20,661
Please.

247
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:21,608
Thanks.

248
00:16:25,099 --> 00:16:26,086
who is your favorite woman?

249
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,746
I want to meet Miyuki

250
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,396
Yes, what would you like to drink?

251
00:16:30,421 --> 00:16:31,055
Water.

252
00:16:31,088 --> 00:16:31,856
Water with whiskey?

253
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:33,116
No, just dilute the ice with water.

254
00:16:33,875 --> 00:16:34,615
Are you kidding?

255
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:36,673
I'm serious.

256
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,144
Dilute the ice with water.

257
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,104
This is quite old-fashioned, isn't it?

258
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:41,910
There is a table charge,

259
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:50,396
What is a table charge?

260
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:53,559
When you take a seat, we will charge you

261
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:56,010
So I'm standing.

262
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,955
No matter it is, we will charge you

263
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:01,917
Don't say like that.

264
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:03,448
Humans are emotional creatures.

265
00:17:04,474 --> 00:17:05,734
Wait a min.

266
00:17:33,823 --> 00:17:36,563
Oh you are here.

267
00:17:37,287 --> 00:17:39,823
Oh you are Tamachan, from the social club?

268
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:41,530
Here, I am called Miyuki

269
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,460
Nice to meet you

270
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,693
So Miyuki is you.

271
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,032
You're using a weird voice.

272
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,700
In the shop, we can only use words like this,

273
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,166
How are you?

274
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
What's with the 'ho ho ho'? I'm just feeling down over here

275
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:03,705
But you know, somehow you've become
prettier since you got this nice dress.

276
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:07,356
I'm taking a milk bath

277
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:09,201
Are you in a milk bath?

278
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:12,255
If the egg isn't in the milk, then you're a milkshake

279
00:18:13,409 --> 00:18:14,209
Welcome!

280
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
This is Deputy Manager Onuki from our club

281
00:18:18,137 --> 00:18:20,569
Regarding the charge,

282
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:27,405
it is automatically required
to be paid by anyone who enters

283
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:29,449
but I will take care of it

284
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:33,895
Sorry for the trouble.

285
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,905
but I'll borrow this

286
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:36,212
Don't be so distant.

287
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:37,693
Ah, Brandy

288
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,046
but you know...I'm going to become your guarantor

289
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,089
You were saying that you wanted to become a singer here,

290
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:45,502
but now you're a hostess?

291
00:18:45,995 --> 00:18:47,415
That's right.

292
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,035
You see, the manager told me to sing, so I sang

293
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:51,508
He can't understand that.

294
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,008
Of course, your singing is just too good

295
00:18:53,121 --> 00:18:53,755
Yes.

296
00:18:54,703 --> 00:18:56,299
Anyway, just take it easy

297
00:18:57,015 --> 00:19:01,994
By the way, is there another girl
named Miyuki?

298
00:19:02,995 --> 00:19:05,035
I'm the only one here

299
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,538
Hey come on.

300
00:19:08,676 --> 00:19:11,352
Is there new comer?

301
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:15,676
Yes there is but I worry if you seduce her.

302
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:18,224
Hey,come on.

303
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,781
Women always seduce me.

304
00:19:20,878 --> 00:19:22,778
So I can't introduce you.

305
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:25,021
Sorry for making you wait.

306
00:19:33,015 --> 00:19:33,575
What?

307
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,206
She is the boss of the Shishido group

308
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,454
The Shishido group,

309
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,329
huh? I'll remember that

310
00:19:42,566 --> 00:19:44,125
That earlier one was a bit of a nuisance,

311
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,373
Is she?

312
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,689
She's just my type, you know.

313
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,171
Hey, your lover is right here

314
00:20:02,504 --> 00:20:03,666
If you seduce her

315
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:06,493
If you get caught by the Shishido.

316
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,458
Shishido...

317
00:20:10,870 --> 00:20:12,259
Wait a minute

318
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,787
I've seem That kid next to her

319
00:20:26,321 --> 00:20:29,321
Please take care of this for a few days.

320
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,270
This is my handmade revolver, you know

321
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,436
If you take care of this automatic,

322
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:36,836
I can let it go for a cheap price

323
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,596
Hey brother, where did you get this PPK?

324
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:40,961
Is this a PPK?

325
00:20:41,561 --> 00:20:43,728
It's got some special grooves cut into it.

326
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:45,321
 and the steel is pretty good too

327
00:20:45,346 --> 00:20:47,332
Where did you get it?

328
00:20:49,112 --> 00:20:51,332
Are you going to take care of it or not?

329
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,344
Let's discuss the price

330
00:20:54,824 --> 00:20:56,991
but I need to think about it a bit.

331
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:02,511
I want to use the phone

332
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,750
The phone?

333
00:21:16,379 --> 00:21:18,472
641 for 53 million.

334
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,113
You may be shot with a pistol during the transaction.

335
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:25,722
Call me later.

336
00:21:46,082 --> 00:21:46,761
Damn it.

337
00:21:48,822 --> 00:21:51,745
It's best not to underestimate the police.

338
00:21:52,209 --> 00:21:55,527
Stealing a letter is also a crime?

339
00:21:55,784 --> 00:22:00,784
Even stealing 1 million yen or a single piece of tissue paper is a crime.

340
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,667
If you get arrested for just one piece of paper, that's a huge loss

341
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,266
No matter what you say

342
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,916
If you get caught, you know

343
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,436
The 1 million yen won't be used, right?

344
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:12,460
Oh, I see. That makes sense, doesn't it?

345
00:22:13,807 --> 00:22:14,456
What?

346
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:15,698
Phone call

347
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:16,699
I see.

348
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:18,913
Well, it's finally time for work.

349
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,925
hey hey hey,use ashtray.

350
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,917
Where is it?

351
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,306
Here.

352
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:24,956
There's a hole.

353
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,566
This side here

354
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,406
This side, this side

355
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,896
Push this side, this side,

356
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,620
Okay?

357
00:22:32,127 --> 00:22:35,127
Hello?it's me, yeah

358
00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:37,675
I see

359
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:39,605
Where is this place?

360
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,394
Yeah, got it

361
00:22:55,005 --> 00:22:56,324
So it's you after all.

362
00:22:56,793 --> 00:22:59,707
Are you going to give me what you took from Hayashi who died the other day?

363
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,096
 What are you talking about?

364
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,613
I came here to get it.

365
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,933
It doesn't quite sound like you're asking me to hand that over

366
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:10,070
By the way, who you guys?

367
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:13,307
There are a lot of you

368
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,316
I'm here alone, you know

369
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,566
That means you're going on a group trip to the hell.

370
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:23,253
Since you're a big group, I'd better give this to you.

371
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:28,324
When I die, there will be fifty thousand women shedding tears

372
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:34,894
Eventually, it will return to my hands,

373
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,992
see? Has it already come back?

374
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:54,691
What?

375
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,487
You're so great.

376
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:01,627
I'm from the Shishido group,Kameda Tatsuyoshi

377
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:05,300
Ah, this is the third time to see you.

378
00:24:05,364 --> 00:24:09,972
right? That pistol was stolen by the dealer Hayashi

379
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:14,003
He was trying to use it as a way to sell without permission

380
00:24:14,465 --> 00:24:16,574
Was it you who killed Hayashi?

381
00:24:17,913 --> 00:24:19,331
There's no need to kill him.

382
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:22,356
It's just a rule

383
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:23,871
By the way

384
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:24,831
What?

385
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,714
I like your pistol skills

386
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:30,978
why not join us?

387
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,193
Are you an idiot?

388
00:24:32,334 --> 00:24:34,097
I'm a lone wolf

389
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Well, if fate allows, we'll meet someday

390
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:51,370
I have eyes on my back. Goodbye, alright?

391
00:24:56,543 --> 00:24:58,543
I have no idea.

392
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:01,574
Tell me

393
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:04,449
I'll take out the gun

394
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:06,949
Hurry up

395
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,199
Did it hurt a little? Sorry about that

396
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,605
OK

397
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:33,584
Thank you for your work.

398
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,699
You were quite an honest guy

399
00:25:47,926 --> 00:25:51,355
so how about I give you this medal?

400
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,730
I'm off.

401
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:04,058
then, you absolutely believe that
Hayashi hasn't done anything, right?

402
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,535
I believe so.

403
00:26:07,042 --> 00:26:10,886
Yocchan got involved for the first
time to help me escape with the funds

404
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,769
I believe so.

405
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,586
Yocchan fell ill in Tokyo

406
00:26:15,617 --> 00:26:26,824
After that, even while coughing up blood in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka,
Nagoya, Kyoto, Osaka, and Shikoku, he stayed by my side

407
00:26:28,149 --> 00:26:29,183
Got it

408
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:34,933
The remaining doubt is why he was killed.

409
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,003
Did he spend the money from shooting the gun,

410
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:41,890
or he was erased because he was about to snitch?

411
00:26:43,816 --> 00:26:45,682
You say that Daisuke Kamoi doesn't have it,

412
00:26:46,894 --> 00:26:50,976
so could it be that the
remaining gun is possibly your gun?

413
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,116
If I had it,

414
00:26:52,147 --> 00:26:53,683
I would be dead from that gun

415
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Thank you for having me

416
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:20,465
Detective

417
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,156
He is my manager

418
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,167
Mr. Tachibana,

419
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,972
He came to visit Miyuki-chan about Mr. Hayashi.

420
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,613
I'm Tachibana.

421
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,542
Do you have any idea who the culprit is?

422
00:27:29,567 --> 00:27:31,573
Oh, roughly

423
00:27:31,747 --> 00:27:34,747
You should practice changing your complexion suddenly

424
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,036
Please come to the club when you have some free time

425
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,176
We will welcome you

426
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,286
Please use my name

427
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,310
Yes, I'm quite busy and broke

428
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Ah, starting the day after tomorrow, there will be a travesty show.

429
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,446
The floor schedule is changing, and it seems the band will be out of the lineup?

430
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:57,470
I wonder if we'll finish early at night?

431
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,636
I haven't been able to talk with Miyuki-chan slowly lately, ah,

432
00:28:01,527 --> 00:28:03,497
I've prepared another apartment.

433
00:28:03,719 --> 00:28:05,515
You are moving there soon

434
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,566
If you're right next to Yuri,

435
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,536
it's hard for Kameda to come,

436
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,636
you know

437
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,106
Kameda?

438
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:14,130
Yes,You're making a strange face.

439
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,331
It's just that the boss handed you over to Kameda

440
00:28:18,769 --> 00:28:20,324
I'm not a doll

441
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,995
That's right, you are not a doll

442
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,786
Since you are a living human,

443
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:27,656
The boss was in the mood to hand you over to the customer.

444
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,370
Daisuke Kamoi

445
00:28:30,472 --> 00:28:31,496
From Miyuki Shima?

446
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:37,426
There's money inside

447
00:28:39,099 --> 00:28:42,099
Dear kamoi,You haven't forgotten about Kamoi Miyuki?

448
00:28:43,382 --> 00:28:46,382
I'm currently on the second floor of the Aoyama apartment

449
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,860
After Yoshio's passing, I am at a loss about what to do alone

450
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,086
Why are you grinning?

451
00:28:53,331 --> 00:28:54,550
Don't read.

452
00:28:54,575 --> 00:28:55,590
Hey come on.

453
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,370
you want to know?

454
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:57,097
Yes.

455
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:02,480
I wonder if Kamoi-sama can understand this feeling?

456
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:03,214
Do you understand?

457
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:05,745
I understand, I understand

458
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:10,808
And right now, what I heard from Kamoi-sama's mouth in the hospital was 'Follow me.'

459
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,106
That's not something I said

460
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:13,916
Well, I guess that's fine

461
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,506
I believe in that and send it every day

462
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:17,683
Oh, is that so?

463
00:29:17,802 --> 00:29:21,574
Is she looking for me?

464
00:29:21,831 --> 00:29:22,964
She wants to meet you.

465
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,019
I have to go, right?

466
00:29:25,144 --> 00:29:25,582
Go go.

467
00:29:25,746 --> 00:29:27,433
Alright then

468
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,269
What? I know,

469
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:33,246
but I understand that I've been taking care from you for a long time

470
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:33,984
That's right

471
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:36,270
then just take one for now

472
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,191
Thanks.

473
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:38,895
Sorry about this blanket

474
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,306
This is a thank you gift. Well then, please live beautifully

475
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,406
You've taken care of me

476
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:43,207
See you.

477
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:54,756
No matter how many times I do, it won't change anything for me

478
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:59,268
Hey, brother! Brother!

479
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,166
What is it?

480
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:02,536
I can't let go of this right now

481
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,956
I'm heading over there now

482
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,226
Hey, hey, hey!

483
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,554
What is it?

484
00:30:07,257 --> 00:30:10,113
What are you going to do? I'm generally tough.

485
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,331
Among us thieves, this is known as the safest place.

486
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,026
Please be patient for a while.

487
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:17,378
Hey, look at this.

488
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:18,472
What is this?

489
00:30:19,879 --> 00:30:21,090
This is a pistol called Devin.

490
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,827
It smells like perfume

491
00:30:24,183 --> 00:30:24,949
How did you get this?

492
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:27,033
This is from a high-end kimono store
in a department store,

493
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,605
and you’ve hit the jackpot

494
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:30,106
That's right, at that age,

495
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:32,324
she was a remarkable beauty at 32,

496
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:34,632
but you know, from that handbag of hers

497
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,306
I quickly opened the clasp,

498
00:30:36,338 --> 00:30:40,261
I took this off a bit, then closed it again, making sure to wipe off the fingerprints perfectly

499
00:30:40,301 --> 00:30:41,316
The woman was holding this?

500
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,407
That's right.

501
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:44,455
Wait a minute

502
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:46,722
is there anything else in here?

503
00:30:46,747 --> 00:30:47,725
This is a business card.

504
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,120
Ah, this must be the owner

505
00:30:50,784 --> 00:30:53,556
Yuko Izumi, President of Setohara Tourism Co., Ltd

506
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,956
I've never heard of
this before.

507
00:30:55,004 --> 00:30:55,940
This is amazing!

508
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,925
This is one of our top 10 so far

509
00:30:58,950 --> 00:30:59,716
Wait a minute

510
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,456
You turn yourself in to the police

511
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:04,050
What? You are stupid.

512
00:31:04,462 --> 00:31:05,888
You're making a fool of yourself,

513
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,016
I am currently the secretary right now

514
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,040
Hey, listen, this money should be returned to the person involved for now, just leave it to her.

515
00:31:11,801 --> 00:31:13,347
I have my own thoughts on this

516
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:14,980
Why?

517
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:17,816
I'm still here.

518
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,616
Hello, Is the president there?

519
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:26,706
Oh, is that you?

520
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,738
I don't have your purse.

521
00:31:30,566 --> 00:31:33,917
but I caught the guy who stole it and ran away

522
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:38,185
I want to talk about what's in your purse.

523
00:31:39,116 --> 00:31:40,922
That's very wonderful.

524
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,566
What would happen if I gave the gun to the police?

525
00:31:53,948 --> 00:31:56,066
Where do we meet?

526
00:32:07,121 --> 00:32:09,316
I thought it was a sightseeing company, is it here?

527
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:13,387
There are a lot of gorgeous women here.

528
00:32:23,551 --> 00:32:24,590
Come in.

529
00:32:31,378 --> 00:32:33,230
You are very beautiful.

530
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:35,705
Is she really the president?

531
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:36,956
Yes she is.

532
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,636
I want  her to be a movie actress

533
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:43,558
You too can be a movie star.

534
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,546
No way, I can't handle being more popular than this

535
00:32:46,671 --> 00:32:48,995
Oh, by the way, I've brought this.

536
00:32:50,826 --> 00:32:53,826
I wonder if there was about 230,000 yen in cash

537
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,433
I'll give you 100,000 yen and this thief 50,000 yen.

538
00:32:58,503 --> 00:32:59,636
You're so great.

539
00:32:59,661 --> 00:33:00,457
I don't need money.

540
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,156
but I do want other things too

541
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,236
So

542
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,683
Take this

543
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:06,894
Thanks.

544
00:33:07,112 --> 00:33:07,858
I want to say that, but...

545
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,894
I'll hold onto this for you

546
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,042
Come on

547
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,956
I'm saying....

548
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:14,965
it's annoying

549
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,106
You should go home quickly, it's already getting late

550
00:33:17,238 --> 00:33:18,004
Come with me.

551
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,311
Just so you know...

552
00:33:21,336 --> 00:33:22,992
That woman is holding a pistol, right?

553
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,456
If you fall for a woman like that, you'll end up bad, you know?

554
00:33:26,019 --> 00:33:26,683
I see.

555
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:27,855
Be careful.

556
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,332
Thank you for your trouble

557
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,093
What's your name?

558
00:33:33,289 --> 00:33:34,316
Kamoi Daisuke.

559
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:37,245
'Suke' does not means pervert.

560
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:42,667
Are you the master of that handgun? I'm so glad to meet you

561
00:33:43,066 --> 00:33:44,183
Are you sure?

562
00:33:45,636 --> 00:33:47,066
I hope you can be a great help to me

563
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,191
I would like your cooperation

564
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:50,824
So why is that?

565
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,144
Do you want to cooperate and have children?

566
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:56,589
That embarrassment is really something, isn't it?

567
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,792
This is a serious conversation

568
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:01,511
I'm completely serious as well

569
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,792
I want you to protect this tower, working together with Mr. Sakiyama

570
00:34:09,074 --> 00:34:10,519
With him?

571
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:13,925
You are a big unreliable person

572
00:34:13,997 --> 00:34:15,784
Well, don't be so angry.

573
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:19,254
Is this your dead husband?

574
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,716
Do you know why he died?

575
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:23,756
I thought you were a widow

576
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,336
I just thought that,

577
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:26,902
but it's not like that

578
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:30,476
This is my brother Masaki who was killed

579
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,500
Huh? Killed?

580
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:38,117
He graduated from a good university

581
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,150
Just as we were about to work on this tower together

582
00:34:42,252 --> 00:34:47,534
He ended up competing with Shishido for this dancer,Yuri Fukigami

583
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:53,472
He was killed

584
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,691
Who did it?

585
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,416
The culprit turned himself in right away and was released

586
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,886
He was a subordinate of the Shishido group

587
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,736
So, it looks like settled it on the surface,

588
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:08,760
but I can't believe that hey turned himself in

589
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:11,785
I'm sure it's a substitute,

590
00:35:13,443 --> 00:35:16,045
which means your brother was killed by a pistol.

591
00:35:17,858 --> 00:35:21,837
He was with Yuri Fukigami in the crowded train station in Hokkaido.

592
00:35:22,868 --> 00:35:23,931
He was shot with a pistol there.

593
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:37,305
Do you want me to find out who killed your brother?

594
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,579
I don't move so easily

595
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:42,486
No?

596
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:46,142
Will you protect this store, me, and Yuri?

597
00:35:46,423 --> 00:35:51,188
I really like playing a pistol, but I absolutely can't stand killing

598
00:35:51,962 --> 00:35:54,962
Besides, I think you, or rather

599
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,987
the president,I would like to protect you but

600
00:35:59,042 --> 00:36:02,124
There's another girl I need to protect.

601
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:06,100
I'm a bit of a cheater, you know

602
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:09,546
At any given time, I make it my
motto to be loyal to one woman

603
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:10,452
Who is she?

604
00:36:10,788 --> 00:36:11,656
My wife.

605
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,816
your wife?

606
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,358
We are newlyweds

607
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,507
But you're beautiful, so I'll think about it.

608
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,327
Anyway, I consulted with my wife

609
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,952
Huh? Yassan brought the money, didn't he?

610
00:36:34,558 --> 00:36:37,558
Can you give this to me?

611
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:46,022
This makes me excited.

612
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,054
so I'll take it.

613
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:07,186
It seems you have a wife.

614
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:09,374
It's none of your business.

615
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:11,249
You are so handsome

616
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:14,866
Ah, in that regard, you don't have to worry,

617
00:37:14,891 --> 00:37:16,210
so that's nice

618
00:37:17,529 --> 00:37:19,054
You're really persistent, aren't you?

619
00:37:19,187 --> 00:37:21,804
Detective can go anywhere.

620
00:37:22,583 --> 00:37:24,999
You're making a big face again, huh?

621
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,913
Did you fall for the invitation from the Shishido group?

622
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,746
Or Would you like to help women in your club?

623
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,015
It's none of your business.

624
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:38,725
Lone wolves don't operate on a monthly salary like you do.

625
00:37:51,445 --> 00:37:52,374
Hello?

626
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,906
You look so nice.

627
00:38:00,624 --> 00:38:01,898
What's wrong?

628
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:05,245
Didn't you come here with a dowry?

629
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:09,624
Well, let's take it easy.

630
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,976
If you marry me,

631
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,788
it might turn into something more complicated

632
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:18,600
Oh, What's wrong?

633
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Alright, here we go!

634
00:38:23,585 --> 00:38:24,476
Go home.

635
00:38:27,277 --> 00:38:28,678
What's wrong?

636
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,916
Even though there was a map written in the letter,

637
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:35,663
Were you kidding me?

638
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,906
If you mess with me like this,
this is what happens

639
00:38:47,788 --> 00:38:49,639
So he was hiding somewhere like a battlefield

640
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:53,556
The current one is quite influenced by television period dramas

641
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,569
Well then, should I go with my period drama?

642
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:04,610
No worries,the ninja escaped.

643
00:39:13,066 --> 00:39:16,718
I was persuaded to write that letter

644
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,429
I know who asked you to do that.

645
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:21,921
Shishido,right?

646
00:39:24,277 --> 00:39:29,694
If that's the case, then everything
in that letter is a lie, right?

647
00:39:30,004 --> 00:39:34,968
You were worried about me and told me to go home.

648
00:39:39,035 --> 00:39:40,405
Don't you think I'm a reliable man?

649
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:43,436
Just leave it to me, okay?

650
00:39:43,461 --> 00:39:46,569
I've received kindness from Hayashi, and I want to return that kindness

651
00:39:46,753 --> 00:39:53,765
What Japan is lacking now is this human touch, so don't worry about it

652
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:58,827
I am a stylish man who dislikes the
forced selling and measuring of kindness

653
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:01,593
I'll keep going until your feelings lean this way

654
00:40:01,968 --> 00:40:03,617
I'll wait.

655
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:08,233
You know what? Yuri-nee said to me.

656
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:09,992
What?

657
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,166
I just called Yuri-san a little while ago

658
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:14,366
I heard about this place, but she said nothing.

659
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,176
Someone from Shishido was nearby, right?

660
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,163
What did she say?

661
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,757
Once a woman is noticed by the yakuza,
it's all over.

662
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:31,830
Isn't it impossible for someone like me to be loved?

663
00:40:33,828 --> 00:40:34,820
I'm sorry.

664
00:40:36,499 --> 00:40:37,913
If I'm here, I'll be a bother.

665
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,929
so it's better if I leave

666
00:40:40,561 --> 00:40:42,776
I know that if you stay here,

667
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,007
your feelings will lean towards me.

668
00:40:46,061 --> 00:40:47,607
I'm going home. Goodbye

669
00:40:48,226 --> 00:40:49,015
ah, wait!

670
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
See, I told you, it's a yakuza

671
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:56,105
I am a lone wolf yakuza.

672
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:01,475
What should I do?

673
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:05,241
I don't know what to do either

674
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,350
I don't care what happens anymore.

675
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,960
I don't care about anything.
I can't live on my own

676
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,218
I'm scared, lonely, sad,

677
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,984
and I want to say happy, but...

678
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:24,239
As long as this  exists, it will be a nuisance for you, right?

679
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:30,367
Or are you telling me to cut ties with this?

680
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,276
No, I'm not saying anything like that

681
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,300
I think a real man is someone who can have it but doesn't use it.

682
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,836
so don't just hold onto it without using it?

683
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:49,328
My deceased mother used to give me New Year's money every year, saying it's fine to have it and use it, but she always said that this brain of mine is the only thing I should really use

684
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:51,390
I didn't really use this much

685
00:41:55,500 --> 00:42:00,336
Alright, I'll give it a shot, but you know...

686
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:08,970
The fact that I'm being called from
Shishido means they have faith in my skills

687
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,234
The club owner also believes in my playing ability,

688
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,360
so I'll be working.

689
00:42:17,088 --> 00:42:21,145
If you ask Yuri, she'll introduce me to a job.

690
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:22,821
You shouldn't get involved with Yuri.

691
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,310
That woman isn't connected to Shishido group.

692
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:35,172
Well then, how about I send you to be a dancer at Club Tower?

693
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,890
I'm the manager, right? The two of them are just a dancer and a manager,

694
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,274
and if I can endure in the middle of that,

695
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,400
then this really isn't much.

696
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:52,031
So let's give i try.

697
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:38,945
The young people are fine

698
00:45:39,250 --> 00:45:40,711
They're taking off the badge?

699
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:44,797
Of course, then let's go.

700
00:45:48,313 --> 00:45:51,266
If this happens frequently

701
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,176
quite troublesome, isn't it?

702
00:45:54,207 --> 00:45:57,207
The Yakuza suddenly move in

703
00:45:57,258 --> 00:45:59,031
In the end, Customers are annoyed

704
00:45:59,547 --> 00:46:02,188
it's those men of unknown background?

705
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:04,956
Kameda-kun,

706
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,922
what does that mean?

707
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,500
I have no idea what you're talking about

708
00:46:08,525 --> 00:46:11,039
It's a well-trained monkey's prank, isn't it?

709
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:11,969
Monkey?

710
00:46:14,517 --> 00:46:19,812
what are you trying to say, president? Well, from where I see it...

711
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:25,795
The internal people underestimated the female president's management and are pulling strings behind the scenes

712
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,492
What?

713
00:46:27,914 --> 00:46:30,813
I'm not saying anything

714
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:36,585
Or is it that when I see you getting serious about something, was it because you did?

715
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:38,422
That's ridiculous.

716
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:47,179
Well, that story is just a story, but if Shishido group supports it, such a commotion will settle down immediately

717
00:46:47,945 --> 00:46:56,362
I think the biggest challenge in managing this store is the
inability to control the power that needs to be restrained.

718
00:46:56,870 --> 00:46:57,773
How about it? Right?

719
00:46:57,969 --> 00:46:58,508
Yes.

720
00:46:59,014 --> 00:47:01,765
I do get a decent reward for our efforts.

721
00:47:02,148 --> 00:47:04,789
I can't just let the young ones eat for free

722
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,676
It's a shame, but in that case,

723
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,700
Masaki's spirits will not be recognized

724
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,916
That was your brother, wasn't it?

725
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:19,148
that man has been through something unfortunate, hasn't he?

726
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:23,531
That's right, one of our Yakuza just got carried away

727
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,476
I’m really sorry about that

728
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:27,956
That's why

729
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:32,859
Because of what happened, I'm most worried about this shop and you

730
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:39,265
It's not like I want to accompany you to this store; I'm just doing it for your sake I just want to lend you my strength.

731
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,157
 I appreciate your kindness, but that's all

732
00:47:46,064 --> 00:47:51,827
It seems that my sincerity isn't being understood well over here

733
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:56,530
That's because you care about your brother and understand that feeling

734
00:47:56,690 --> 00:47:59,132
I know, but

735
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,429
How about taking a moment to reconsider with an open heart?

736
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,730
I know who killed Masaki

737
00:48:10,033 --> 00:48:14,327
The true culprit of the murder is Shishido, and we can take his revenge here

738
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:18,376
Moreover, tonight's commotion was orchestrated by Shishido

739
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,616
Isn't Kamoi-san here?

740
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:21,356
If we have Kamoi-san working for us,

741
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:22,554
we can defeat the enemy right away.

742
00:48:22,647 --> 00:48:23,491
Stop it.

743
00:48:24,022 --> 00:48:26,176
I don't want to give Kamoi-san a gun

744
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:27,937
He is also patient.

745
00:48:28,347 --> 00:48:31,347
no, I will reveal everything.

746
00:48:37,851 --> 00:48:38,835
Yuri!

747
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:46,804
now take this gun

748
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:48,455
and go through the floor to scatter from the back

749
00:48:49,170 --> 00:48:50,155
The car is ready.

750
00:48:51,437 --> 00:48:52,484
I did something terrible

751
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:54,718
but it was you who pulled the trigger

752
00:48:55,013 --> 00:48:56,955
The Shishido group has given you the buried money

753
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,225
We paid back your debt from gambling.

754
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,374
I didn't kill anyone

755
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,186
Your fingerprints are on it, you know

756
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:05,210
The boss will give you the money as promised

757
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,257
Now go

758
00:49:13,265 --> 00:49:14,499
Assistant manager.

759
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,510
Pull yourself together. What's wrong with Masaki?

760
00:49:20,905 --> 00:49:22,999
What do you want to say, sister?

761
00:49:23,367 --> 00:49:27,812
Masaki-san, Masaki-san

762
00:49:28,234 --> 00:49:31,069
Yuri!

763
00:49:31,113 --> 00:49:31,897
President

764
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:34,968
Assistant manager raised their pistols, He came out the back door.

765
00:49:38,882 --> 00:49:40,952
It turns out the leader was inside after all.

766
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:45,196
Hey you guys! Don't move until the police arrive!

767
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:46,466
Hey, call police

768
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:49,498
Once police arrived

769
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:52,451
Your cute feelings will disappear

770
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,749
You guys should be careful

771
00:49:55,126 --> 00:49:56,749
I don't have anything dangerous on me.

772
00:52:04,054 --> 00:52:05,311
Ohnuki has been killed

773
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:07,276
What?

774
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:10,503
Down at the cliff of the driveway with the car

775
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:12,828
that’s definitely a staged murder

776
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:16,343
If it's my turn next

777
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:23,890
You're booking your funeral, but the truth is there are people who will be taken out before you

778
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:28,945
Someone who knows the murderer of Ohnuki and Yuri

779
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,876
In other words, I want to make sure not to forget Miyuki Shima

780
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,900
Miyuki is an unauthorized person in the Yuri murder case

781
00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:37,649
What if you report it to the police?

782
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:40,196
How much has Miyuki leaked to the police,

783
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,220
What will happen if Kameda and Shishido come out without any evidence?

784
00:52:44,212 --> 00:52:47,571
The next funeral is reserved for Miyuki, isn't it?

785
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:52,461
You can protect her but you can't protect me?

786
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:59,094
If you could just hold this place together, Kamoi-san...

787
00:52:59,850 --> 00:53:02,850
I want you to become a co-owner here

788
00:53:04,761 --> 00:53:07,836
If you seek, you shall be given;
that's the way it goes?

789
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,300
You're the only one who will be dissatisfied in this marriage

790
00:53:14,954 --> 00:53:17,235
I only rely on you.

791
00:53:18,688 --> 00:53:21,423
I have to respond to your request.

792
00:53:22,881 --> 00:53:23,726
I tell you

793
00:53:24,842 --> 00:53:27,961
You won't find a man like this again

794
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:52,454
Well then, if that's the case,

795
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:56,220
Tell me everything without holding back?

796
00:53:58,735 --> 00:53:59,640
Where on earth do you live?

797
00:54:00,747 --> 00:54:04,391
I have no idea where you go after leaving this store,

798
00:54:06,244 --> 00:54:07,650
I rent a lot of apartments.

799
00:54:09,418 --> 00:54:13,344
I have to deceive the Shishido Group.

800
00:54:14,310 --> 00:54:15,946
Even so, can't they find you?

801
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,094
That's right.

802
00:54:18,345 --> 00:54:23,048
How about if we let Miyuki live in that apartment?

803
00:54:23,605 --> 00:54:28,657
Kamoi-san, if we do that, you'll protect me here, right?

804
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,938
Well, that's probably a good idea, right?

805
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:47,032
You don't have a single penny for taxes, do you? Until recently, you were living it up,

806
00:54:47,057 --> 00:54:50,057
but you've thrown it all away on booze, women, and gambling

807
00:54:53,411 --> 00:54:54,317
You know very well, don't you?

808
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
I studied physiognomy.

809
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,266
Oh, can you read faces too?

810
00:55:00,290 --> 00:55:01,805
I see, well

811
00:55:07,212 --> 00:55:08,265
Thank you for the meal.

812
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,665
Who told you I would give it to you?

813
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:13,550
Huh? I have plenty of this.

814
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:18,766
No matter where you go, I follow you

815
00:55:18,877 --> 00:55:19,893
If you follow me

816
00:55:19,918 --> 00:55:21,313
then I can do business, right?

817
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,142
Just do it

818
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:26,460
the handcuffs will only dig into your wrists

819
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:34,641
I say! That Kamoi has it.

820
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:38,295
He said he got it from the murdered Hayashi

821
00:55:38,328 --> 00:55:40,821
So,he has it, right?

822
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:41,868
Thanks.

823
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,985
This is because there isn't enough
food left, It can't be helped.

824
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,940
He is perhaps the neighbor around here,

825
00:56:09,649 --> 00:56:11,360
Hello?
Is that Aoki apartment?

826
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,760
Is Kamoi Daisuke there?

827
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:20,173
Kamoi

828
00:56:21,797 --> 00:56:23,696
Find out the name of his shoes

829
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,720
What are you doing?Refrain from calling without permission

830
00:56:27,666 --> 00:56:29,112
Pay up properly

831
00:56:30,933 --> 00:56:34,269
If I let my guard down, you call me right away.

832
00:56:35,347 --> 00:56:36,281
You are stupid.

833
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,306
You can't take this.

834
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:47,829
The one who killed Hayashi was Shishido,Kameda

835
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:50,867
and the one who killed Yuri was Tachibana

836
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,876
This plan will work.

837
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:00,300
but can I leave this here?

838
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,296
Yeah

839
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:05,320
They might be able to watch over things for a while,

840
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:07,329
so can you do that?

841
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:10,366
I see, she said yes.

842
00:57:11,249 --> 00:57:14,696
You say nice things.

843
00:57:21,884 --> 00:57:23,415
Kamoi-san?

844
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:29,709
While I'm surrounded by the president's apartment,

845
00:57:31,759 --> 00:57:32,978
With another woman....

846
00:57:33,321 --> 00:57:36,321
you don't have to worry

847
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,586
I used to fall in love three times a day, you know

848
00:57:39,610 --> 00:57:41,368
Recently, I only do it about once every three days,

849
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:43,063
and they just come to me

850
00:57:43,123 --> 00:57:45,258
I can't even keep up with them

851
00:57:46,493 --> 00:57:48,384
You always make fun of me.

852
00:57:50,661 --> 00:57:52,228
Don't sulk.

853
00:57:53,725 --> 00:57:56,725
I hate people who cry easily.

854
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:57,796
You say such foolish things,

855
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,560
Wanna be my wife,right?

856
00:58:06,309 --> 00:58:08,358
I'm sorry.

857
00:58:28,698 --> 00:58:31,002
Oh you.

858
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,636
You really are a connoisseur, aren't you?

859
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:35,945
Yuri Fukigami was shot with a compact pistol.

860
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,096
It's penetrating

861
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,026
You know the power of that shot, right?

862
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,026
I have no idea what you mean by never having held it like that

863
00:58:42,050 --> 00:58:43,136
Or is there none?

864
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,306
Are you saying that I killed Yuri?

865
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:48,330
I'm pretty sure that the one who killed Yuri, Ohunuki, committed suicide

866
00:58:48,723 --> 00:58:51,288
Tell me you have it or not.

867
00:58:52,433 --> 00:58:54,218
I don't have it.

868
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,373
So was it lie?

869
00:58:58,184 --> 00:59:00,059
Who did you say that to?

870
00:59:01,470 --> 00:59:04,470
No, no, no, it was this morning

871
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,807
It was this morning

872
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:07,818
that the ghost of Hayashi appeared in my bed

873
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:09,098
Is it Yoshio's?

874
00:59:09,131 --> 00:59:10,476
Don't trust him.

875
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:19,226
The ghost says that the guy I entrusted my pistol before I
died knows who the real culprit of this incident is

876
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:22,066
I can even call souls from the afterlife

877
00:59:23,423 --> 00:59:24,774
What a pathetic guy

878
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:27,869
I don't even know the name of the criminal

879
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,093
That's your job to find it.

880
00:59:32,406 --> 00:59:39,307
if you're going to believe what a ghost says, then the investigation is going to be a bit of a mess.

881
00:59:40,127 --> 00:59:40,987
Well.

882
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:44,267
I'm going to make a reservation for the wedding venue now

883
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,486
If you have some free time, please represent as a friend

884
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:47,936
Come on, let's go!

885
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,960
Hey, if you saw that, just tell me!

886
00:59:51,426 --> 00:59:53,261
Mention one of them, whether it's Shishido,Kameda, or Tachibana,.

887
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:58,218
the lead about Shishido's gun will come to light

888
00:59:59,970 --> 01:00:01,606
Both Hayashi and Yuri were shot with the same bullet

889
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:03,798
Getting yakuza to turn themselves in is pointless.

890
01:00:07,954 --> 01:00:08,928
Hey,

891
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,841
Sorry, but you'll need to get in another car.

892
01:00:12,402 --> 01:00:13,316
Another car?

893
01:00:20,547 --> 01:00:21,786
Let's go.

894
01:00:32,497 --> 01:00:35,021
She wants to do business with me

895
01:00:36,053 --> 01:00:39,053
I might have no choice but to accept

896
01:00:44,867 --> 01:00:52,465
To protect Miyuki, I have to crush the Shishido, and in the end, the president will make me her co-owner

897
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:59,092
Well, if I can protect Miyuki, it's not bad that this shop has become half ours

898
01:01:04,758 --> 01:01:06,053
Wow, that's quite a hefty piece

899
01:01:07,124 --> 01:01:10,288
I used to be very famous for this skill in the police force.

900
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,748
Were you a police officer before?

901
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,795
I want to see your technique

902
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:24,748
I can fire 15 shots from this pistol at 25 yards.

903
01:01:26,312 --> 01:01:32,154
It possesses shooting capabilities of over 70 points with 10 shots,

904
01:01:33,604 --> 01:01:39,943
is familiar with the techniques of applied shooting, and has acquired mobility skills

905
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,803
Five shots in 15 seconds, huh?

906
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,520
So that's one shot every three seconds?

907
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,085
If we play like that, Miyuki will forgive me, right?

908
01:02:30,901 --> 01:02:34,334
A .22 caliber revolver, that's a rare style

909
01:02:34,545 --> 01:02:35,624
This is my hand made.

910
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:37,785
Shoot from the left

911
01:02:37,810 --> 01:02:38,850
I'll shoot from the right,

912
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:41,249
Ready?

913
01:02:41,514 --> 01:02:42,061
Ok

914
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:46,897
You can start anytime, you know

915
01:02:58,085 --> 01:03:00,092
I was a little faster than you

916
01:03:32,882 --> 01:03:34,123
Today, I'm really lucky.

917
01:04:10,506 --> 01:04:12,936
How was it?

918
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:27,243
Anyway, Kamoi-kun is amazing.

919
01:04:27,623 --> 01:04:32,483
Really amazing. With Kamoi's presence, the tower is safe

920
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:35,136
They might be threatening to kill the assistant manager

921
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:39,575
and even the upper dancers, saying I'm next,

922
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,826
but it won't go that way, right?

923
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,264
No, no, I am a man with no other abilities

924
01:04:44,289 --> 01:04:47,289
I'm only good for pistol and woman.

925
01:06:11,215 --> 01:06:12,842
Isn't that Tachibana, Yuri's manager?

926
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:14,967
Help me out

927
01:06:15,715 --> 01:06:19,537
Alright, I'll help you, but in exchange,tell me who killed Masaki

928
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,701
Help me!

929
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,127
Kameda killed him.

930
01:06:24,989 --> 01:06:25,795
Help me out.

931
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:26,694
Thanks.

932
01:06:29,553 --> 01:06:30,694
Stay strong.

933
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:39,355
hey Kamoi, hurry up, hurry up!

934
01:06:39,380 --> 01:06:40,166
Wait a minute.

935
01:06:49,016 --> 01:06:52,927
Tachibana said that Kameda killed
Masaki-san.

936
01:06:55,403 --> 01:06:56,494
Thank you,Kamoi-san.

937
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:59,201
You killed Tachibana.

938
01:07:00,426 --> 01:07:02,919
Hold on, I didn't do it.

939
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,022
You did!

940
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:08,038
Don't joke around.

941
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,342
look at mine

942
01:07:21,357 --> 01:07:22,511
I did it?

943
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:29,027
That's why I'm telling you thank you.

944
01:08:20,614 --> 01:08:21,800
It's a .22 caliber

945
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:24,897
This is how the victim was killed.

946
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:27,608
It must be quite close since it penetrated through

947
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,006
I heard that his hand gun is also 22

948
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,949
Do you know if Kamoi had a .22 caliber?

949
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:43,063
I believe he did

950
01:08:45,410 --> 01:08:47,696
You mentioned earlier that you used to have the same job as me

951
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:48,734
The reason for your resignation?

952
01:08:50,469 --> 01:08:53,583
While escorting the suspect, I fell off the train with the suspect.

953
01:08:54,406 --> 01:08:58,281
I see, then please contact us as soon as Kamoi appears.

954
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,204
Ah, Kamoi?

955
01:09:09,595 --> 01:09:10,462
Where are you now?

956
01:09:11,499 --> 01:09:13,324
On platform 3 at Osaka Station?

957
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:34,160
I really can't trust him.

958
01:09:39,419 --> 01:09:42,101
Take this and go somewhere until everything settle down.

959
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:44,839
I really killed Tachibana?

960
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,611
Can you think of any other culprit?

961
01:09:54,535 --> 01:09:55,802
Where is Miyuki?

962
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,716
I'll quickly contact her.

963
01:10:01,541 --> 01:10:05,336
Go to No.3 port.
I will prepare a boat.

964
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:09,151
So hurry up, polices are at Osaka station.

965
01:10:13,636 --> 01:10:14,669
See you.

966
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,244
Miyuki? Kamoi is in a pinch right now

967
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:35,638
Anyway, if you want to clear Kamoi's suspicions,

968
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:40,005
Tell the police about the culprit of Fukigami Yuri
and what Yuri-san wanted to say before she died

969
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:42,232
It would be better to directly report the name of the murderer of Masaki's case.

970
01:10:43,166 --> 01:10:45,835
it's better to directly  go rather than over the phone

971
01:10:46,143 --> 01:10:48,069
How about talking to Doi-san?

972
01:10:48,768 --> 01:10:49,922
Go right away.

973
01:10:56,393 --> 01:10:58,770
With this, the ShiShido group will collapse completely

974
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:01,789
The club will also thrive

975
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,161
Perhaps Masaki's spirit can rest

976
01:11:06,434 --> 01:11:09,294
It's only Mr. Kamoi who loses out.

977
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,956
He is immortal.

978
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,161
Next, the news

979
01:11:58,851 --> 01:12:02,971
Today, the police headquarters announced that the perpetrator of the murder case from two years ago was a substitute,

980
01:12:03,310 --> 01:12:04,986
and that the real culprit is someone else

981
01:12:05,010 --> 01:12:06,930
There is a daughter who made a delivery

982
01:12:07,506 --> 01:12:13,177
That person is 20-year-old Miyuki Shima, who reported that Tatsuya Kameda,

983
01:12:13,490 --> 01:12:18,277
an executive of the Shishido group, was the real perpetrator of the murder case in front of Osaka Station two years ago

984
01:12:19,110 --> 01:12:22,696
Additionally, Shima has stated new facts that Goro Ohnuki, the deceased deputy manager of the nightclub Tower,

985
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:30,559
is not the real perpetrator in the murder case of Yuri Fukugami

986
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:32,893
This concludes the news

987
01:12:34,146 --> 01:12:38,592
What a foolish fool, She's been hooked.

988
01:12:39,106 --> 01:12:39,682
well, From now on,

989
01:12:39,798 --> 01:12:40,890
I'm going to fish

990
01:12:41,506 --> 01:12:43,392
You are stupid.
She's been hooked.

991
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:50,510
Alright, if it’s come to this, I’ll be bold too!

992
01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:30,262
Oh! Isn’t that you, Kamoi-san?

993
01:13:30,642 --> 01:13:33,366
Hey, Tamako,milkshake! Weren’t you at the club?

994
01:13:34,193 --> 01:13:36,592
Are you kidding me?
I already quit there.

995
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,664
She apparently wants to be a stripper.

996
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:41,850
Again?

997
01:13:42,009 --> 01:13:45,123
The president over there said she couldn't become a stripper.

998
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:48,499
According to the director... she could become a slipper

999
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:51,815
She can't be a stripper,but slipper?

1000
01:13:52,028 --> 01:13:53,836
It's ridiculous

1001
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,460
I mean, look at this great body I have, right?

1002
01:13:56,538 --> 01:13:57,564
 Who do you think you are?

1003
01:13:57,803 --> 01:13:58,772
And what are you doing now?

1004
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:01,506
I am Yassan's wife.

1005
01:14:02,263 --> 01:14:03,639
Have you become a wife of a thief?

1006
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:05,240
Don't say such things that sound bad

1007
01:14:05,550 --> 01:14:07,759
I quit that job.

1008
01:14:08,290 --> 01:14:10,698
Right now, I'm part of a sales team,The drug dealer.

1009
01:14:10,891 --> 01:14:12,920
Thief turned into a drug store.

1010
01:14:14,486 --> 01:14:17,005
Every day I'm being made to struggle

1011
01:14:18,605 --> 01:14:21,166
So, what are you doing now?

1012
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:22,766
What am I up to?

1013
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,618
That's because I am being chased as a murderer!

1014
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:30,115
You are really cool.

1015
01:14:31,159 --> 01:14:32,806
Wow, you've really risen to prominence,
haven't you?

1016
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:33,493
Congratulations!

1017
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,784
Come on

1018
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:39,023
Wasn't there a girl named Miyuki Shima here?

1019
01:14:39,993 --> 01:14:42,822
No one seems to be around at all

1020
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:44,766
So we decided to live here

1021
01:14:44,883 --> 01:14:47,514
We've got all the tools ready

1022
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:50,556
After all, She's being protected by the police

1023
01:14:50,840 --> 01:14:52,839
Or is the president going to take responsibility?

1024
01:14:54,166 --> 01:14:58,665
Alright, I can't just leave it like this. I'll come back again.

1025
01:14:58,690 --> 01:15:01,446
Hey, if the police arrest you next time,

1026
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:03,032
What should I bring as a contribution? It feels good

1027
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,415
Cut it off!

1028
01:15:07,148 --> 01:15:13,485
President, my pistol is that while I may save people, I would never kill anyone

1029
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,540
I don't understand what kind of thinking that is

1030
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,480
Just calm down,Mr. Kamoi.

1031
01:15:19,735 --> 01:15:21,024
I can't.

1032
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:27,709
It's strange that a murder suspect is your partner.

1033
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:33,985
Right now, I just want to say one thing as the president's appointee at Miyuki

1034
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:40,180
I really are a yakuza, playing pistol and having someone killed

1035
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,852
Goodbye,that's all I can say

1036
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:50,868
Take me to your apartment

1037
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:54,780
I want to see my girlfriend before I get arrested.

1038
01:15:55,876 --> 01:15:57,056
I can't.

1039
01:15:57,910 --> 01:15:58,845
Why?

1040
01:15:59,387 --> 01:16:03,852
We might get shot at by a car tire before we reach the apartment

1041
01:16:03,986 --> 01:16:07,603
Why are you more afraid of Shishido than the police?

1042
01:16:08,788 --> 01:16:09,938
Hey, wait, think a little more

1043
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:16,071
If Kameda comes out after a 48-hour detention period due to insufficient evidence

1044
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,276
First, the target is her

1045
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,001
Isn't that right?

1046
01:16:20,860 --> 01:16:22,227
We have to wait one more day

1047
01:16:23,930 --> 01:16:25,634
If Kameda's suspicion is strong,

1048
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,160
they say there will be another 21 days of detention by the prosecutor

1049
01:16:30,170 --> 01:16:33,170
Instead of rushing this moment, let's have a 21-day buffer.

1050
01:16:36,072 --> 01:16:37,048
I see.

1051
01:16:38,822 --> 01:16:40,775
This is a time for patience.

1052
01:17:00,555 --> 01:17:03,027
Boss, who said that?

1053
01:17:03,680 --> 01:17:04,626
I don't know

1054
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:06,486
In any case, she clearly stated the location

1055
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:09,510
If we go there, we will definitely find Shima Miyuki.

1056
01:17:09,746 --> 01:17:11,678
Where is Kamoi now?

1057
01:17:12,630 --> 01:17:14,113
He should be in the storage room of the tower

1058
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,763
That's also from her saying.

1059
01:17:35,680 --> 01:17:39,515
I really don't want to be in a place like this,

1060
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,092
This is not where I belong.

1061
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:43,820
Well, the food is good.

1062
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,071
Miyuki Shima was kidnapped.

1063
01:17:49,156 --> 01:17:49,793
Are you sure?

1064
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,857
Kameda was released?

1065
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:54,611
Yes.

1066
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:56,855
If you take her back

1067
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,416
You must accept their challenge.

1068
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:00,885
I just got a call from them.

1069
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:05,624
Did that kid sniff out that I'm already here?

1070
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:10,235
place and time?

1071
01:18:11,488 --> 01:18:12,088
Here.

1072
01:18:14,949 --> 01:18:16,742
Well, I've double-checked the, so it's all good.

1073
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:26,894
What do you want at this time?

1074
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:29,007
Come with me.

1075
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:30,456
I don't know what you want, though

1076
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:31,576
I'm not in a hurry right now

1077
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,600
I'll let you do what you like, so just shut up and follow me

1078
01:18:34,870 --> 01:18:35,663
What the hell is that?

1079
01:18:36,501 --> 01:18:39,701
I want you to take a look at the handgun

1080
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:42,353
I can't handle this anymore

1081
01:18:45,163 --> 01:18:48,864
Ha, it's first time to hear that, let's go

1082
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,315
Oh what's this

1083
01:18:59,758 --> 01:19:03,118
Would I be arrested for carrying a handgun?

1084
01:19:04,728 --> 01:19:06,305
Let me shoot it.

1085
01:19:06,523 --> 01:19:08,683
Wait, you can't shoot it.

1086
01:19:08,710 --> 01:19:09,120
Why?

1087
01:19:09,194 --> 01:19:10,495
only the person in charge can.

1088
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,062
That's ridicules.

1089
01:19:11,555 --> 01:19:12,619
Come on.

1090
01:19:16,137 --> 01:19:18,574
Can you handle this?

1091
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:19,586
What?

1092
01:19:31,037 --> 01:19:36,821
The one on the right is the .22 caliber bullet you shot with your handgun, and the one on the left is the caliber of the bullet that killed Tachibana

1093
01:19:37,093 --> 01:19:38,678
What do you think?

1094
01:19:39,225 --> 01:19:40,385
See, it's different after all

1095
01:19:40,930 --> 01:19:41,836
It's about the handgun, you know

1096
01:19:41,860 --> 01:19:43,530
Each one has its own personality

1097
01:19:44,200 --> 01:19:45,471
Even if the caliber is the same,

1098
01:19:45,526 --> 01:19:49,179
the light rays from bullets
fired from the same gun match,

1099
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:52,381
but those fired from different guns do not

1100
01:19:53,340 --> 01:20:00,479
Therefore, the bullet that killed Tachibana was not fired from your homemade gun

1101
01:20:01,126 --> 01:20:02,433
You get it?

1102
01:20:03,427 --> 01:20:04,127
Kamoi?

1103
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:15,151
He seems interested in divination, doesn't he?

1104
01:21:37,486 --> 01:21:39,126
You ended up searching for a great place, you know

1105
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:46,967
In a landscape like this, playing gun is a delightful pastime, and the sound that comes out is just wonderful

1106
01:21:47,691 --> 01:21:48,731
Kamoi?

1107
01:21:53,281 --> 01:21:55,551
Can you please return that young lady to me?

1108
01:21:56,510 --> 01:21:58,637
I'll let her the train pass and go home a little earlier

1109
01:21:59,370 --> 01:22:03,468
Miyuki-chan, when you get home, cook a steak

1110
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:06,498
Should we go to the police after a bath and eat beef steak?

1111
01:22:06,680 --> 01:22:09,065
I'll return the woman

1112
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,877
Instead of her, give the pistol over here.

1113
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:23,183
Give me another one.

1114
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:27,549
it's going to be a big deal.

1115
01:22:34,433 --> 01:22:35,292
Miyuki!

1116
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:40,393
Hey!
We are not dummies for target practice.

1117
01:22:45,838 --> 01:22:49,975
I attached what you wanted to my body using rubber bands.

1118
01:24:04,097 --> 01:24:05,097
Just one is left.

1119
01:24:23,104 --> 01:24:24,218
It's too far.

1120
01:25:44,577 --> 01:25:45,457
Don't move!

1121
01:25:49,092 --> 01:25:52,225
Put the pistol down!

1122
01:26:01,826 --> 01:26:04,501
Well, I’ve been saying it from the start like that.

1123
01:26:14,855 --> 01:26:16,875
Your ride has arrived

1124
01:26:17,413 --> 01:26:18,319
This is no use either,

1125
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:19,035
so take it.

1126
01:26:45,912 --> 01:26:47,725
I'm glad.
You weren't hurt?

1127
01:26:48,213 --> 01:26:49,055
I see.

1128
01:26:55,764 --> 01:26:56,638
Kamoi Daisuke.

1129
01:26:57,310 --> 01:26:58,728
Arrest you for illegal possession of a handgun.

1130
01:26:58,990 --> 01:27:00,508
I don't have anything on me

1131
01:27:04,542 --> 01:27:06,833
Look, isn't it strange? Shall we go now?

1132
01:27:08,182 --> 01:27:08,782
Goodbye.

1133
01:27:31,481 --> 01:27:35,159
Manager, you really have made me into a murderer, haven't you?

1134
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:39,726
You're the only one who can shoot from behind Tachibana at that scene

1135
01:27:39,850 --> 01:27:46,258
That's right, I found out your caliber
was 22 when we played the game

1136
01:27:48,070 --> 01:27:49,917
Why did you do such a blatant thing?

1137
01:27:50,810 --> 01:27:51,989
Hiroko is my girl

1138
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:55,786
You're going to take her from me on the side

1139
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:57,028
I can't stand.

1140
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,620
I don't want to let you take Hiroko and the shop

1141
01:28:05,299 --> 01:28:07,739
but the president's heart is set on me

1142
01:28:08,550 --> 01:28:12,296
a handsome man, just like a guy on the parallel bars

1143
01:28:13,209 --> 01:28:16,209
It was Hiroko who said to shoot Tachibana with the 22 caliber gun.

1144
01:28:19,510 --> 01:28:22,510
It was also Hiroko who tried to frame you as a murderer

1145
01:28:23,853 --> 01:28:26,968
Hiroko was trying to trap you.

1146
01:28:27,031 --> 01:28:27,963
Stop it.

1147
01:28:29,018 --> 01:28:29,732
Moreover....

1148
01:28:31,425 --> 01:28:35,515
Hiroko hid Miyuki, and she was reported to the police.

1149
01:28:36,706 --> 01:28:38,696
Hiroko was the one who handed Miyuki over Shishido.

1150
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:43,080
Even so, do you really think that Hiroko loves you?

1151
01:28:43,701 --> 01:28:45,081
Stop it.

1152
01:28:54,495 --> 01:28:56,923
You were faster than the police, weren't you?

1153
01:29:03,242 --> 01:29:03,835
Sorry.

1154
01:29:04,148 --> 01:29:04,815
Kamoi.

1155
01:29:06,708 --> 01:29:10,300
It seems that he has fallen for you.

1156
01:29:12,580 --> 01:29:14,380
so You've deceived my gun.

1157
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:17,599
But I won't hate you.

1158
01:29:18,750 --> 01:29:20,839
I really liked your thoughtfulness towards your younger brother.

1159
01:29:22,575 --> 01:29:27,325
You won't be able to charm girls until you
can say lines with this kind of significance

1160
01:29:27,350 --> 01:29:28,772
Huh? Oh, what a handsome man

1161
01:29:29,642 --> 01:29:31,349
You're back again, huh?

1162
01:29:37,240 --> 01:29:38,598
He illegally possessed a handgun.

1163
01:29:39,418 --> 01:29:42,418
I'm just holding the opportunity to raise your salary

1164
01:29:43,496 --> 01:29:44,203
See you.

1165
01:29:45,267 --> 01:29:47,667
Your wife is waiting for you.

1166
01:30:14,752 --> 01:30:16,980
What to do....

1167
01:30:20,228 --> 01:30:21,815
Miyuki or gun.

1168
01:30:22,385 --> 01:30:24,112
Gun or women.

1169
01:30:27,806 --> 01:30:28,899
They are here.

1170
01:30:58,115 --> 01:30:58,961
What the heck?

1171
01:31:02,845 --> 01:31:04,775
I really can't become a decent person.

1172
01:31:07,165 --> 01:31:10,111
I'm going to stop being a husband for a while.

1173
01:31:30,576 --> 01:31:38,109
THE END

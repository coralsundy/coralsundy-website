2
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:20,829
Black Trump Card (1964)

3
00:01:31,163 --> 00:01:32,491
I have to go.

4
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:35,124
Don't leave me alone.

5
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:49,766
Oh..It's past midnight.

6
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:56,688
You're meeting with the usual.
Someone strange.

7
00:02:04,122 --> 00:02:05,989
What are you going to talk about with him?

8
00:02:06,935 --> 00:02:08,356
It's none of your business.

9
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:13,067
I know.
You're up to something.

10
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,267
Maybe you're trying to avenge your father's death.

11
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:21,470
It could be.

12
00:02:26,869 --> 00:02:33,619
I can't get the image of my dad sitting in the fire and dying out of my head.

13
00:02:37,244 --> 00:02:40,517
I just can't get that fire out of my head either.

14
00:02:44,536 --> 00:02:48,505
When I got there, the building was about to come crashing down on him.

15
00:02:50,443 --> 00:02:52,021
Ironic, isn't it?

16
00:02:52,904 --> 00:02:57,919
Until then, I was a typist and the president's boy.

17
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:04,816
If the company goes under and the CEO commits suicide...
The son will be the one to feel responsible.

18
00:03:05,066 --> 00:03:09,082
Don't say that.
You'll meet what kind of person?

19
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,814
What are you going to do?

20
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:16,439
I have no idea.
It's not friendship or anything.

21
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:20,455
Friends with the same goal of revenge.

22
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:22,291
See you.

23
00:03:40,972 --> 00:03:42,261
They are Nanbada

24
00:03:43,574 --> 00:03:46,628
they're very famous around here.

25
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:48,964
You can't control them alone.

26
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,160
You don't have to concern about them.

27
00:03:52,238 --> 00:03:55,831
Should I bow to them like Mr. Yoshino?

28
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:59,339
You should stay away from the Yakuza world like me.

29
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,050
Think about it.

30
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:09,738
When my boss was killed, he was trying to say something to me before he died.

31
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:14,749
He was like. I feel shame,Ken.

32
00:04:15,398 --> 00:04:17,046
I can't forget.

33
00:04:17,265 --> 00:04:18,226
2 beers.

34
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:23,273
The Chikamatsu group has lost territory and members.

35
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,218
That leaves you and a man.

36
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:28,609
We'll beat Nanbada.

37
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:31,093
I'm no longer Yakuza.

38
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,359
Not you.

39
00:04:33,241 --> 00:04:33,968
Who?

40
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:37,476
I don't know.
He's just so smart.

41
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:38,577
Welcome.

42
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:40,702
Welcome.

43
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:43,015
You're doing great.

44
00:04:43,577 --> 00:04:44,726
Oh Ken.

45
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:47,296
How's your business?

46
00:04:48,116 --> 00:04:50,991
I'm different from you guys.

47
00:04:53,769 --> 00:04:56,988
Would you like to meet our boss?

48
00:04:57,198 --> 00:04:58,331
I'll go with you.

49
00:04:58,456 --> 00:05:01,081
I don't want to be indebted to that person.

50
00:05:02,745 --> 00:05:05,956
He is a very selfish scam.

51
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:20,788
You guys hit me.
You guys know exactly what's going to happen?

52
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,600
You know how hard I punch.

53
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:33,485
I got a job to do. I'll pay you back later.

54
00:06:17,587 --> 00:06:18,993
How's it?

55
00:06:20,048 --> 00:06:21,485
Police patrol is over.

56
00:06:22,517 --> 00:06:22,954
Where's him?

57
00:06:24,368 --> 00:06:25,157
1 am.

58
00:06:25,415 --> 00:06:26,150
He's coming soon.

59
00:06:30,843 --> 00:06:31,234
He?

60
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,758
Both of you are punctual and wonderful.

61
00:06:47,117 --> 00:06:47,976
Let's go.

62
00:07:04,477 --> 00:07:07,321
So the midnight patrol found nothing out of the ordinary.

63
00:07:09,204 --> 00:07:10,954
So the safe was ok.

64
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:12,618
Good morning.

65
00:07:19,029 --> 00:07:19,927
Damn it.

66
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:24,904
Are you Ueda?

67
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,037
Well, they won't touch any of the cash, and the safe is intact.

68
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:32,071
Was something stolen?

69
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:35,868
Nothing can be stolen other than money.

70
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:40,759
Well, as I recall, your house was burglarized last week.

71
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,149
The thief never touched any of your valuables or money.

72
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:45,392
Yeah.

73
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:50,376
And this week, your company was targeted, and They did the same way.Is there anything you're not aware of?

74
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,899
Nothing.

75
00:08:03,768 --> 00:08:07,104
Ube is calling for you.

76
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:13,229
Hello, this is Kazue.

77
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:17,253
The Master is still on a trip.

78
00:08:18,042 --> 00:08:20,081
Oh,that bookkeeping?

79
00:08:21,301 --> 00:08:27,801
Yeah it was stolen.
I need Chairman Fukazawa to return ASAP.

80
00:08:28,193 --> 00:08:33,193
I'll make the necessary arrangements.
Please be careful.

81
00:08:34,153 --> 00:08:35,825
See you.

82
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:43,273
I'm back.

83
00:08:43,672 --> 00:08:44,820
Thank you for your work.

84
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:50,609
I'm trying to get some info on what happened at the UBE house.

85
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:55,742
Again, the money was not stolen.
Apparently something important was taken to replace it.

86
00:08:55,937 --> 00:08:57,000
What do you mean by that?

87
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:58,445
UBE doesn't say it.

88
00:08:58,765 --> 00:09:01,617
I think he's afraid of us investigating.

89
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:08,177
I see.
So he lied about being a thief to blind us.

90
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,974
It could be.

91
00:09:11,771 --> 00:09:16,114
He was very scared.
If so, he was too good at acting.

92
00:09:16,896 --> 00:09:18,029
Come in.

93
00:09:20,118 --> 00:09:22,485
I was asked to deliver this to you.

94
00:09:22,719 --> 00:09:23,219
Who?

95
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:24,407
he didn't say his name.

96
00:09:25,055 --> 00:09:27,188
He said if you look inside, you'll know right away.

97
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,062
Thank you for your work.

98
00:09:37,296 --> 00:09:39,757
This is Kyokuto Shinkin Bank back book keeping.

99
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,688
Please find out who delivered this.

100
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,174
Welcome.

101
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:12,627
Are you alone?

102
00:10:13,158 --> 00:10:14,681
I wanna be relaxed.

103
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:19,322
The bar has been renovated and many customers are now coming in.

104
00:10:20,259 --> 00:10:24,181
He's the bandmaster, NEGORO.
He gives me lots of ideas.

105
00:10:27,163 --> 00:10:28,577
He can be used, so please take care of him.

106
00:10:29,398 --> 00:10:30,702
Welcome.

107
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:32,382
Come with me.

108
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:34,976
Serve him.

109
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,804
I heard you brought that Band back that night.

110
00:10:41,747 --> 00:10:43,270
You have nice eyes.

111
00:10:43,754 --> 00:10:47,106
I happened to find them in a small bar.

112
00:10:47,653 --> 00:10:49,075
Did you have fun with them?

113
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,653
please don't cheat on me

114
00:10:55,934 --> 00:10:57,676
Are the guys here?

115
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,075
I need to see them.

116
00:11:00,356 --> 00:11:01,661
Oh here.

117
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:03,161
Hold on.

118
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:04,137
Who are you?

119
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,520
We are Nanbada.

120
00:11:06,449 --> 00:11:10,542
You destroyed our gang.
I'm KENICHI TADA.

121
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:15,114
You asked someone to kill our boss.
We are here to kill you.

122
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,231
Ready?

123
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:29,597
Stop it....

124
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:32,394
Who are you?

125
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:34,785
we are open for business.
Get out from here.

126
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:37,605
If you get in my way, you'll get hurt.

127
00:11:47,869 --> 00:11:50,283
The police are coming, so if you don't get arrested, go home right away.

128
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,901
Damn it.

129
00:11:55,642 --> 00:11:58,611
We'll pay you back.

130
00:12:01,941 --> 00:12:05,324
I'm sorry for bothering you all.

131
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,402
you are very strong.

132
00:12:09,824 --> 00:12:10,472
Let's have drink.

133
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:12,121
Customers are waiting.

134
00:12:28,176 --> 00:12:30,762
He's great.
What's his name?

135
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,715
Kyohei Negoro.

136
00:12:33,973 --> 00:12:35,965
I think he should stop playing music.

137
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:37,910
Please bring him here when he performs.

138
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,723
I hear Tada came.

139
00:12:40,691 --> 00:12:42,863
Don't worry.
Everything is fine.

140
00:12:49,934 --> 00:12:50,902
I get it.

141
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,613
Tell him you won't forget tonight.
This is the reward for him.

142
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,592
Well, what's happened can't be helped

143
00:13:06,178 --> 00:13:11,099
Mr. Nambada will be coming soon, so let's think about it after that.

144
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:15,123
But I'd like you to do something about it as soon as possible.

145
00:13:15,998 --> 00:13:18,740
If the truth comes out, it'll be a problem.

146
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:20,412
I'm well aware of that.

147
00:13:21,326 --> 00:13:24,311
No matter what happens, we will help you

148
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:26,326
Have a tea.

149
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,779
Here please.

150
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:38,710
Mr. Nambada is here.

151
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,990
Sorry I'm late.

152
00:13:42,073 --> 00:13:44,313
I've just backed too.

153
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:46,739
Have you heard about it from Kazue?

154
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:48,626
Yes almost.

155
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:55,371
Actually, I got this in the mail yesterday.

156
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:04,298
Is this you?
This is well done.

157
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:06,690
This is handcuffs.

158
00:14:07,376 --> 00:14:10,636
Please look into it immediately.

159
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,128
I'll find out soon.

160
00:14:14,972 --> 00:14:16,445
But police is the problem.

161
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:20,998
Why don't you go to our vacation home for a while?

162
00:14:21,698 --> 00:14:25,185
vacation home? You mean boss's hakuun mountain's?

163
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:29,684
Not there but Hong kong.

164
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:35,035
There's a call for boss.

165
00:14:39,282 --> 00:14:43,582
Hello? Yes he is here. who are you?

166
00:14:46,504 --> 00:14:47,864
He doesn't say his name.

167
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,968
Hello, this is Fukazawa.
Who is this?

168
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:01,021
Hello,Hello.

169
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:06,895
What's this?

170
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,305
It's a funeral march

171
00:15:22,942 --> 00:15:23,902
Who is this?

172
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:28,126
It could be Mischief.
Fuck you.

173
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,070
Welcome home.

174
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:53,365
We made them to listen to the tape.
You were right. Fukazawa was in Katsura.

175
00:15:53,672 --> 00:15:55,726
they were surprised.

176
00:16:02,405 --> 00:16:05,419
Now, finally, the declaration of war is over.

177
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,033
I met with NANBADA, just like we planned.

178
00:16:09,752 --> 00:16:13,412
Now we just have to see how the D.A. handles that bookkeeping.

179
00:16:14,417 --> 00:16:17,171
Do you know the Osaki D.A. ?

180
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:22,834
College is an interesting place.
Ex-convicts help prosecutors.

181
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,574
We are like that.

182
00:16:25,764 --> 00:16:32,344
Negoro.Nanbada attacked me and you helped to take me to the hospital.

183
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,943
I've been at your beck and call ever since.

184
00:16:36,478 --> 00:16:40,844
I was drinking alone at the bar counter when you tapped me on the shoulder.

185
00:16:42,947 --> 00:16:45,254
And we don't know much about you.

186
00:16:45,913 --> 00:16:49,753
Why don't you tell us why you're helping us?

187
00:16:52,974 --> 00:16:54,020
I'm as well.

188
00:16:56,655 --> 00:16:57,689
I want revenge.

189
00:16:58,103 --> 00:17:02,543
But for me not Nanbada but their boss.

190
00:17:04,743 --> 00:17:05,696
Tell me the detail.

191
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,077
What's wrong?

192
00:17:27,832 --> 00:17:28,798
Are you ok?

193
00:17:28,912 --> 00:17:29,825
It's ok.

194
00:17:43,256 --> 00:17:44,409
You're that frustrated?

195
00:17:45,617 --> 00:17:49,004
You can tell me when you're feeling better.

196
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:51,946
Take it easy.

197
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:58,561
What the hell are we, friends?

198
00:17:58,888 --> 00:17:59,548
Comrade.

199
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:06,097
We're here to defeat the beasts of our time, who abuse the law to destroy good people one after another.

200
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,658
I'm excited.

201
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:11,289
I feel great.
It's not just about getting back at the yakuza.

202
00:18:31,991 --> 00:18:32,858
This was what we thought.

203
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,743
I didn't know he left Japan.

204
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,410
Damn it.
They are great.

205
00:18:40,066 --> 00:18:42,413
I don't know what to do.

206
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:47,243
I'll get closer to Nambada and find out.

207
00:18:48,868 --> 00:18:51,241
You are the another option.

208
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,361
What?

209
00:18:55,294 --> 00:19:00,421
I'll have Ube's whereabouts thoroughly pursued.
The problem is the backstory of the Far East bank.

210
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:06,426
In addition to the regular credit union route, there is a black team route centered on the UBE.

211
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:10,524
In other words, it's a stranger to private finance.

212
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:16,770
Even financial, business, and political figures have invested in the company as individuals while concealing their names.

213
00:19:17,815 --> 00:19:22,501
They use the money to pay higher interest than legally required.

214
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,484
This is an abuse of the law

215
00:19:27,274 --> 00:19:32,214
They have deep connections with the business world and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

216
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:37,099
For example, Konosuke Mitamura.

217
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:42,672
Hideo Takizawa of TOYO Finance or Yoshinori Fukasawa of Asian Development.

218
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:47,456
Ube must be one of the subordinate.

219
00:19:49,085 --> 00:19:52,545
I agree with you, it's better to stop at the last minute economic violation.

220
00:19:53,411 --> 00:19:56,891
If it becomes a political issue...
I'm sure they'll get a lot of help.

221
00:19:57,945 --> 00:20:03,732
I would suggest looking for the main culprit.

222
00:20:05,387 --> 00:20:06,467
This is what I do.

223
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:14,958
It's good to have ideals.
After all,  You only catch the gangs and you don't catch the main culprit.

224
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:18,073
We should be careful.

225
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:20,539
OK.

226
00:20:20,908 --> 00:20:23,921
Find out who the victims of the black market have been.

227
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,267
I'm sure one of them sent the bookkeeping.

228
00:20:28,866 --> 00:20:32,732
I agree with you.
We are working on it.

229
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:35,136
We'll find out.

230
00:20:35,322 --> 00:20:37,844
Osaki,there's a call for you.

231
00:20:38,251 --> 00:20:39,031
Thanks.

232
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:41,835
Hi' I'm Osaki D.A.

233
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:47,172
Oh Togo.
When did you back?

234
00:20:48,148 --> 00:20:52,775
Just now.
I had a friend take over for me and I got home a flight early.

235
00:20:54,156 --> 00:20:56,183
Because today is my birthday.

236
00:20:57,003 --> 00:20:58,137
Did you forget?

237
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,212
I remember.

238
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:01,847
Let's go for dinner.

239
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:04,471
Come to Silk Road night club.

240
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:09,567
Even the D.A. goes there.

241
00:21:11,231 --> 00:21:13,851
8PM.
I'll book the table.

242
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:16,863
Sorry.

243
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:17,983
From your fiancee?

244
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:22,715
But that call was not private use.

245
00:21:23,068 --> 00:21:23,581
Why?

246
00:21:24,431 --> 00:21:27,297
Nanbada gang team is very clever.

247
00:21:27,852 --> 00:21:29,932
They did start a real estate and construction company.

248
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:35,366
They are related to UBE and have a connection with Yoshinori Fukasawa.

249
00:21:36,252 --> 00:21:42,065
Actually, the Silk Road CLUB is a private store in Nambada.
I'm going to check it out by posing as a customer.

250
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:43,163
OK.

251
00:21:44,438 --> 00:21:48,565
I'd really like you to pay for it.
But I'll pay on my own.

252
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:24,438
What would you like?

253
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:25,751
My friend will come, then we'll order.

254
00:22:25,925 --> 00:22:26,905
I see.

255
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:35,603
Long time no see.

256
00:22:39,938 --> 00:22:41,412
I play saxophone here.

257
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:44,602
Happy Birthday.

258
00:22:45,002 --> 00:22:47,769
You have a nice memory.

259
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,132
Who you will meet?

260
00:22:52,082 --> 00:22:52,842
I'll take a guess.

261
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:54,669
Osaki?

262
00:22:55,609 --> 00:22:56,102
Yes.

263
00:22:57,307 --> 00:23:00,367
He's always worried about you.

264
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:02,881
Welcome.

265
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:08,941
You're not still married to Osaki?

266
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,076
He's busy with work.

267
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:17,382
You haven't changed.

268
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:22,632
You are always quiet, and beautiful.

269
00:23:25,406 --> 00:23:29,419
I wanted to date with you, but Osaki was won.

270
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:38,733
I've never lost to him in the study or in music.
In life, he's the winner.

271
00:23:41,072 --> 00:23:43,432
Are you married?

272
00:23:45,058 --> 00:23:47,671
I'm always alone.
I'm not getting married.

273
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:51,432
Why?
I know you like someone.

274
00:23:53,005 --> 00:23:55,778
Yes I can't forget about her.

275
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,397
So I'm always alone.

276
00:24:09,758 --> 00:24:12,198
Am I interrupting something?

277
00:24:14,223 --> 00:24:17,097
Excuse me.
Mr. President is here.

278
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:18,616
Where?

279
00:24:19,303 --> 00:24:20,083
Manager's Office

280
00:24:26,191 --> 00:24:27,344
What's wrong?

281
00:24:29,565 --> 00:24:31,198
I'm sorry to say this.

282
00:24:32,253 --> 00:24:35,147
Negoro asked me to tell you that.

283
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,400
Come.

284
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,261
When did you become his girl?

285
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:43,895
Don't get me wrong.
I worry about you.

286
00:24:44,456 --> 00:24:46,543
I can only love one girl.

287
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:50,772
But you always talk about Negoro.

288
00:24:51,951 --> 00:24:53,358
So What's wrong?

289
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:58,763
The old Chikamatsu gang's henchmen got together and beat up the president's office.

290
00:25:06,492 --> 00:25:10,726
You seemed really cheerful and happy.
You suddenly changed your mind.

291
00:25:13,234 --> 00:25:17,454
And then one day you moved away from me.

292
00:25:19,755 --> 00:25:21,849
You're right.

293
00:25:23,532 --> 00:25:24,612
I left from you.

294
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:31,212
I dreamed of having a happy family with you.

295
00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:39,673
I heard your parents got something wrong.

296
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:48,020
My Mom committed suicide.

297
00:25:50,437 --> 00:25:52,657
Why? What happened?

298
00:25:53,735 --> 00:25:55,102
I have a right to know.

299
00:25:56,395 --> 00:26:00,841
I was your fiancee before.

300
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:18,606
Tomoko.

301
00:26:20,741 --> 00:26:22,087
Sorry I'm late.

302
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:24,211
Oh Negoro.

303
00:26:25,299 --> 00:26:27,726
It's not good to keep your fiancée waiting.

304
00:26:29,082 --> 00:26:30,955
I happened to meet him.
He play saxophone here.

305
00:26:31,362 --> 00:26:33,289
Oh that's good.

306
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,617
Today is TOMO's birthday.
Let's celebrate together.

307
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:38,000
Brandy

308
00:26:38,214 --> 00:26:38,854
Sure.

309
00:26:40,017 --> 00:26:41,817
Do you play piano?

310
00:26:41,995 --> 00:26:44,161
Yes When I'm frustrated.

311
00:26:44,631 --> 00:26:47,418
You can be pianist if you are good.

312
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:50,305
Yes you are right.

313
00:26:51,193 --> 00:26:54,287
I was a bad student, like a failed student.

314
00:26:55,162 --> 00:26:56,895
You're no good as a prosecutor.

315
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:06,085
I saw something in the paper about the Far East Credit Union.
I can't believe the chairman of the board let you get away with it... just like your piano.

316
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:08,659
Why you know?

317
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,839
I had a law degree, too.
And I was getting better grades than you.

318
00:27:17,366 --> 00:27:18,306
Here it is.

319
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:21,572
Cheers again.

320
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,017
Happy birthday.

321
00:27:28,659 --> 00:27:30,992
When did you start to work here?

322
00:27:31,738 --> 00:27:32,725
A half month ago.

323
00:27:33,813 --> 00:27:34,820
Do you know the manager here?

324
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:36,670
I think Nanbada.

325
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:43,189
Something to do with Nanbada and the Chairman of the Board of the Far East Credit Union bank.

326
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,714
I didn't know.

327
00:27:47,528 --> 00:27:53,521
Apparently there is a connection between Nanbada and Fukazawa, the man who collapsed your house.

328
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:56,615
Did you check out my house?

329
00:27:58,412 --> 00:28:02,346
When I was going through Fukazawa's background.
I found out about your parents' misfortune.

330
00:28:04,169 --> 00:28:06,509
You've been away from us.

331
00:28:08,262 --> 00:28:09,695
How's your father?

332
00:28:13,936 --> 00:28:14,629
He's dead?

333
00:28:18,952 --> 00:28:23,125
He's in a vegetative state.

334
00:28:28,891 --> 00:28:34,104
You have a grudge against Fukasawa.
But you work at NANBADA. Is that by chance?

335
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:36,434
What if I'm not?

336
00:28:36,912 --> 00:28:37,765
I need your help.

337
00:28:39,062 --> 00:28:41,722
Forget hate with the power of law.

338
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:43,666
Are you a good prosecutor now?

339
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:47,012
I'm not but Japanese law is great.

340
00:28:47,617 --> 00:28:51,691
If that were the case, there would be no bad guys in this world.

341
00:28:52,811 --> 00:28:55,491
Gero, Fukazawa,Nanbada,Ube

342
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,295
They're all breaking the law and prospering.

343
00:28:58,691 --> 00:29:01,771
You want to avenge them alone.

344
00:29:03,146 --> 00:29:06,706
I would do it at any cost.

345
00:29:08,227 --> 00:29:12,867
But I too once wanted to study law and become a prosecutor or a lawyer

346
00:29:15,084 --> 00:29:19,031
For the sake of the Japanese legal establishment, I wish you all the best.

347
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:25,513
Excuse me.

348
00:29:26,053 --> 00:29:26,926
The boss wants to see you

349
00:29:36,747 --> 00:29:38,233
Make Tomoko happy.

350
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:41,503
If you don't, I won't forgive you.

351
00:29:46,374 --> 00:29:50,467
I was sure he sent us the bookkeeping.

352
00:29:53,154 --> 00:29:53,688
Come in.

353
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,521
Thanks for your help the other day.

354
00:29:58,849 --> 00:30:00,836
Thanks too.

355
00:30:01,427 --> 00:30:01,960
Wanna drink?

356
00:30:02,107 --> 00:30:03,127
I'm still working.

357
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:07,431
I heard from Miki.
How did you get the information?

358
00:30:09,483 --> 00:30:14,390
I was gang before.
My mates was gathered by money

359
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:20,466
Reach.

360
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:23,892
Hello?

361
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,980
Who's there?

362
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,807
Say your name.

363
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:30,385
Oh..boss..

364
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:32,085
From Boss.

365
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:32,978
Stupid.

366
00:30:33,872 --> 00:30:35,832
I'm sorry, stupid answered your phone.

367
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,698
What?
Chikamatsu team is coming here?

368
00:30:39,711 --> 00:30:41,018
Here's so peace.

369
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,097
I think that's wrong information.

370
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:48,490
Someone came to tell me about it.

371
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,308
He said there was nothing wrong.

372
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:58,530
It's good if so.

373
00:31:06,446 --> 00:31:06,832
Hey.

374
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:15,596
Here.

375
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,329
That doesn't make sense.

376
00:31:18,849 --> 00:31:21,595
Hey look at this!

377
00:31:23,901 --> 00:31:24,828
You are lucky.

378
00:31:28,862 --> 00:31:29,336
Bet.

379
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:32,857
Here you go.

380
00:31:33,964 --> 00:31:35,051
I'll bet more.

381
00:31:41,053 --> 00:31:41,839
Here you go.

382
00:31:43,054 --> 00:31:43,901
What’s that?

383
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,898
I'm too busy to play.

384
00:31:47,105 --> 00:31:48,458
Look around there.

385
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:55,478
Oh damn it.

386
00:31:56,072 --> 00:31:56,812
Oh my god.

387
00:31:58,438 --> 00:31:59,218
Here you go.

388
00:32:14,485 --> 00:32:16,912
Be careful, hurry up.

389
00:32:23,311 --> 00:32:24,491
Hello, President.

390
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,385
Oh damn it.

391
00:32:32,695 --> 00:32:33,429
President.

392
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,476
Still no idea who did it?

393
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:39,320
I'm thinking it's the TADA case.
Did you find him?

394
00:32:39,765 --> 00:32:43,133
I looked for him, but I don't know where he went.

395
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:48,539
It was bad of you to let your guard down.

396
00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:49,547
I’m sorry.

397
00:32:49,945 --> 00:32:50,789
Be careful.

398
00:32:57,688 --> 00:32:59,469
Negoro,get in the car.

399
00:32:59,587 --> 00:33:01,954
I have to go somewhere.

400
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:06,688
You were right.
I'll give you the profit.

401
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:16,391
It's your responsibility.

402
00:33:16,416 --> 00:33:18,109
You missed him.

403
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:20,664
Damn it.

404
00:33:28,112 --> 00:33:30,987
In order to realize the above 2nd development plan

405
00:33:31,354 --> 00:33:37,299
we need a location north of Hakuunsan.

406
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,440
But some of this land is state-owned.

407
00:33:40,698 --> 00:33:43,409
Currently applying to the Ministry of Finance.

408
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:47,737
We'd like to ask for Chairman Fukazawa's help.

409
00:33:50,042 --> 00:33:51,370
Leave it to me.

410
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,753
Thank you very much.

411
00:33:54,526 --> 00:33:55,339
Excuse me.

412
00:34:00,464 --> 00:34:02,636
I have to interrupt the meeting due to an urgent matter.

413
00:34:17,186 --> 00:34:19,920
It's better if we don't meet here.
What's wrong?

414
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,772
I received a call from Hong Kong saying that Mr. Ube is coming to Japan.

415
00:34:26,256 --> 00:34:28,288
Ube?
Why?

416
00:34:28,313 --> 00:34:32,014
They say his child is unwell.

417
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,097
what should we do?

418
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:35,917
Up to you.

419
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,868
Are you sure about this information?

420
00:34:46,603 --> 00:34:52,493
He remembers the news, and even though the name is different, he contacted UBE as there is no doubt in his mind that it is UBE.

421
00:34:53,728 --> 00:34:57,353
You have a nice friend.

422
00:35:14,981 --> 00:35:15,809
Please.

423
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:32,013
Mr. Ueki?
this is an arrest warrant.

424
00:35:36,696 --> 00:35:37,719
come with us.

425
00:36:00,571 --> 00:36:04,454
I'd like to keep him quiet.

426
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:08,298
It's none of your business.

427
00:36:09,064 --> 00:36:11,946
I always say that.

428
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:21,060
We have a problem with Ube.

429
00:36:24,498 --> 00:36:25,951
I'll leave it to you.

430
00:36:28,677 --> 00:36:30,474
Show him that.

431
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,803
I'll give you something you've always wanted.

432
00:36:38,959 --> 00:36:41,474
I'm bothering you about Ube.

433
00:36:44,668 --> 00:36:45,316
Here it is.

434
00:36:46,465 --> 00:36:47,371
What's this?

435
00:36:49,738 --> 00:36:51,301
Oh this.

436
00:36:52,566 --> 00:36:55,434
It belongs to Mr. SHAKO's wife.

437
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:04,308
Leave it to me.
I'll make sure you won't be inconvenienced.

438
00:37:05,372 --> 00:37:08,794
I'm not worried about that either, since you're in charge.

439
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:13,583
New Asia Development is working on the issue of disposing of Hakuunsan.

440
00:37:14,309 --> 00:37:16,590
I forgot the name of the head of the Department of Management at the Ministry of Finance.

441
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:18,426
Koyama?

442
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:20,981
Are you in good contact with him?

443
00:37:21,317 --> 00:37:24,153
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

444
00:37:26,986 --> 00:37:31,182
By the way, they sent this doll to my place.

445
00:37:31,549 --> 00:37:33,158
They sent this doll to my place too.

446
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:41,307
Does this mean I'm going to be hanged?

447
00:37:41,776 --> 00:37:43,401
This is ours.

448
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:46,182
You find who did this?

449
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:48,612
He must be TADA of Chikamatsu-gumi.

450
00:37:48,854 --> 00:37:49,432
No.

451
00:37:50,877 --> 00:37:56,174
This is not a gangster's job.
There's always someone else who did this.

452
00:38:06,441 --> 00:38:07,949
Hello, it's me.

453
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:10,777
Who called my husband?

454
00:38:13,996 --> 00:38:14,543
What?

455
00:38:15,348 --> 00:38:16,410
Apparently he won't give his name.

456
00:38:18,684 --> 00:38:19,801
Connect here.

457
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:23,947
Hello?

458
00:38:40,654 --> 00:38:41,584
Again.

459
00:38:47,131 --> 00:38:50,240
Don't worry.
He is very smart.

460
00:38:52,568 --> 00:38:56,740
Other than gang..oh you know him?

461
00:38:57,185 --> 00:39:00,928
We have Hayashi, who took away the property as collateral because we were unable to repay it.

462
00:39:01,709 --> 00:39:02,256
I think he is.

463
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:05,294
He's not.

464
00:39:07,295 --> 00:39:08,741
He targets me.

465
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:10,780
You?

466
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:13,123
And he's got it all planned out.

467
00:39:13,998 --> 00:39:16,295
please investigate him.

468
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:21,702
I worry my life.

469
00:39:24,646 --> 00:39:28,185
You worked for Hayashi Shoji for three years until it went bankrupt.

470
00:39:30,529 --> 00:39:34,568
I heard that you were good friends with the son of the deceased company president.

471
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:43,106
We would like to hear from Tetsuya about the incident at the Far Eastern Credit Bank.

472
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,336
Do you know where he lives now?

473
00:39:48,368 --> 00:39:51,328
Until recently, he lived in an apartment in Sakuradai.

474
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:55,539
But he moved away half a month ago, and I don't know where he is now.

475
00:39:56,282 --> 00:39:58,625
How do you communicate with him?

476
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,016
He just call me.

477
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,672
He seems to be planning a personal vendetta.

478
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:09,078
It could be.

479
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:13,782
Because his father died so tragically

480
00:40:14,852 --> 00:40:16,688
Would you like to tell me what happened?

481
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:28,442
He borrowed money at a high interest rate.
The terms were terrible. There were rumors that the entire company's fortune had been transferred.

482
00:40:30,439 --> 00:40:33,275
The company was on fire, so I flew down.

483
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:36,540
It was big fire.

484
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:38,650
Testuya.

485
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,263
Dad.

486
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,060
Dad.

487
00:41:01,657 --> 00:41:05,314
Well, since then, the TETSUYA have changed.

488
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:08,853
But you're not alone.
He's got company.

489
00:41:10,392 --> 00:41:13,525
He's got friends in the Yakuza.

490
00:41:14,689 --> 00:41:19,369
And there's another strange person. He's taking advantage of Tetsuya.

491
00:41:20,236 --> 00:41:22,158
He must be Negoro.

492
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,759
I have no idea

493
00:41:26,576 --> 00:41:28,662
Thank you very much.

494
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,568
I'm getting figure out.

495
00:41:39,162 --> 00:41:43,170
Negoro was at Haneda Airport.
Negoro do something with them.

496
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:45,693
I'll win.

497
00:41:46,685 --> 00:41:50,529
Once UBE is caught, the law will take care of the rest.

498
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:55,606
I make him confess.

499
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:02,897
I'll take care of it then.

500
00:43:03,343 --> 00:43:06,874
Because I'm a client of the boss.
Don't forget to tell him that.

501
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:07,866
I know.

502
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:18,649
why don't you knock?

503
00:43:20,313 --> 00:43:23,540
Why do you come to my dressing room?

504
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:25,985
I'd love to play with you.

505
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:27,985
I'm glad.

506
00:43:29,235 --> 00:43:31,000
I've got nice body.

507
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:32,547
How about tonight?

508
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:36,704
I can't tonight.
I have a prior engagement.

509
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:38,383
Is he the president's customer?

510
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:41,625
I hear he's an official.

511
00:43:42,672 --> 00:43:43,157
Which?

512
00:43:43,891 --> 00:43:45,141
I have no idea.

513
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:48,204
But the boss said he'd give me tips.

514
00:43:49,863 --> 00:43:52,668
How about tomorrow?

515
00:43:53,809 --> 00:43:56,270
I can't wait, I'm a man.

516
00:43:58,028 --> 00:44:02,036
I think the officials will go home soon after playing.

517
00:44:02,793 --> 00:44:05,700
Come see me as soon as you're done.

518
00:44:06,489 --> 00:44:09,536
OK.
Don't lock the door.

519
00:44:19,016 --> 00:44:20,829
How was last night?

520
00:44:21,665 --> 00:44:25,110
You are much better than him

521
00:44:26,728 --> 00:44:29,274
Chief of the Administration Department works on land disposals

522
00:44:29,415 --> 00:44:31,282
Yes that's right.

523
00:44:32,298 --> 00:44:37,329
The official seems very bossy.

He said it all depends on how you fill out the paperwork.

524
00:44:38,036 --> 00:44:39,521
So Mt.Hakuun.

525
00:44:41,435 --> 00:44:44,435
He's meeting with the boss early next week to get it done.

526
00:44:45,364 --> 00:44:47,646
He wants me to meet with him again then.

527
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:49,638
Next week?

528
00:44:50,841 --> 00:44:51,396
That's right.

529
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:57,700
I want to get a lot of money from the president and go to a hot spring with you.

530
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:00,896
Good.

531
00:45:03,593 --> 00:45:04,452
My friend.

532
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:17,700
Who are you?

533
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,777
You came too early

534
00:45:22,464 --> 00:45:23,074
Get out.

535
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:24,363
Hold on.

536
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:28,321
I need to wear.

537
00:45:28,595 --> 00:45:30,377
Get out.
You are always naked.

538
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:35,908
By the way, he says he'd much rather have my body than yours.

539
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,897
If you're so disappointed, why don't you try it with your body?

540
00:45:41,928 --> 00:45:46,139
I'll pay you back later.

541
00:45:48,982 --> 00:45:53,928
You sleep with women to use them.
You wanted to know who my client was last night, so you dragged her into it.

542
00:46:02,898 --> 00:46:07,296
What the hell are you?
Did you approach me in a seductive way to take advantage of me?

543
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:15,347
I wanted to change my job to another more upscale bar.

544
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:18,425
No.
You want to do something with Nanbada.

545
00:46:18,894 --> 00:46:21,949
You're using me to get the president to trust you and find out what's going on.

546
00:46:30,493 --> 00:46:33,821
Don't make fun of me.
I'll tell him you are spy.

547
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,462
What are you going to do with me?

548
00:46:52,737 --> 00:46:53,909
Destroy me?

549
00:46:54,893 --> 00:46:56,885
I can't.

550
00:46:57,401 --> 00:47:01,010
I loved it.

551
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,010
Ube.
You can tell me everything now.

552
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:22,393
You are not capable of doing anything wrong.

553
00:47:25,447 --> 00:47:30,596
We have a certain person marked as the mastermind behind your appointment to the board of directors.

554
00:47:31,386 --> 00:47:36,003
We believe that you were merely taken advantage of in the recent UKIYOSHI case.

555
00:47:39,665 --> 00:47:41,352
Tell me,Ube.

556
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:49,806
Hello, Osaki room.

557
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:57,923
Who are you?

558
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:01,665
I'll ask him.

559
00:48:09,822 --> 00:48:13,150
Your son is Ichiro?

560
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:17,353
Is something wrong with Ichiro?

561
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:21,283
The hospital informed me that he's dying.

562
00:48:22,056 --> 00:48:23,415
Really?

563
00:48:25,917 --> 00:48:28,964
I want to meet him.

564
00:48:29,886 --> 00:48:31,011
Please.

565
00:49:34,615 --> 00:49:35,771
Are you alright?

566
00:49:36,396 --> 00:49:37,302
Wait.

567
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:38,763
Wait.

568
00:49:40,746 --> 00:49:41,504
Are you alright?

569
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:50,754
That was stupid of him to get called out on a fake phone call.

570
00:49:51,746 --> 00:49:54,605
I'm sorry.

571
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,386
Ube was murdered.
The Far East Credit Union case is over.

572
00:50:04,129 --> 00:50:05,215
I'll find who did it.

573
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:10,712
Osaki,The murderer has turned himself in.

574
00:50:11,884 --> 00:50:12,579
Really?

575
00:50:15,165 --> 00:50:16,439
How many times have I told you?

576
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:20,126
My brother works for the company that went under.

577
00:50:20,728 --> 00:50:23,251
They don't even get a severance package.

578
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:27,056
That's when I started going after him.

579
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:29,970
Bullshit.
Someone asked you to kill him.

580
00:50:30,618 --> 00:50:32,525
I did it alone, for the world.

581
00:50:33,783 --> 00:50:35,431
Because you guys don't work.

582
00:50:35,790 --> 00:50:36,673
Don't say bullshit.

583
00:50:37,189 --> 00:50:39,642
Don't make excuses like that.

584
00:50:41,353 --> 00:50:43,744
Can I have a cigarette?

585
00:50:51,952 --> 00:50:53,952
Damn it.

586
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:56,281
I wanted to kill UBE.

587
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:58,351
My feelings were half-hearted.

588
00:50:59,991 --> 00:51:01,999
Leave it to OSAKI from now on.

589
00:51:03,343 --> 00:51:09,015
If you're happy with the UBE being killed, then you can leave now.

590
00:51:13,272 --> 00:51:16,889
Before I decide that, why do you hate FUKAZAWA so much?

591
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:19,124
Tell me.

592
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:22,944
Yeah,It's time you had a talk.

593
00:51:31,539 --> 00:51:36,563
It was shortly after the war ended.

594
00:51:38,414 --> 00:51:42,617
My father took care of Fukazawa, who called himself a Manchurian Ronin

595
00:51:44,637 --> 00:51:50,036
I used my father in Fukasawa to do all kinds of business.

596
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,770
Smugglers, black market finance...

597
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:57,801
He learned to make money by breaking the law.

598
00:51:58,809 --> 00:52:03,270
It may have been his inborn talent.

599
00:52:06,409 --> 00:52:11,519
And he seduced my mother.

600
00:52:15,042 --> 00:52:18,480
My foolish mother..
She left me and went into Fukazawa.

601
00:52:20,097 --> 00:52:21,730
My father never complained.

602
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,847
My father had borrowed a lot of money from Fukazawa.

603
00:52:29,933 --> 00:52:33,066
Then Fukazawa abandoned my mother.

604
00:52:37,757 --> 00:52:38,811
My mom killed herself.

605
00:52:43,554 --> 00:52:44,405
I'm sorry.

606
00:52:45,225 --> 00:52:46,147
Moreover.

607
00:52:48,022 --> 00:52:52,616
After my mother and I died, he used my house as collateral for a loan.

608
00:52:54,527 --> 00:52:55,831
I was a junior in college.

609
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:00,831
I was studying law, and I hated him.

610
00:53:03,206 --> 00:53:08,816
But people who violate the law have many lawyers.

611
00:53:11,138 --> 00:53:16,466
Court notices, foreclosures, and forced evictions before I know anything about it.

612
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:21,959
The law that was supposed to protect us persecuted us.

613
00:53:24,256 --> 00:53:28,678
I was disappointed in the law and quit university.

614
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,443
6 years later.

615
00:53:35,279 --> 00:53:40,521
Fukasawa became the back world and boss of the economic world.

616
00:53:41,324 --> 00:53:42,511
He did it in violation of the law.

617
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:50,222
When I decided to take my revenge on him personally.
Your father killed himself.

618
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:52,683
Your master was murdered.

619
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:56,520
How's your father?

620
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,020
Is he dead?

621
00:54:10,522 --> 00:54:11,491
He killed himself.

622
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:16,748
If so, I've already given up.

623
00:54:19,845 --> 00:54:22,478
Don't ask me.

624
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:35,195
What can I do for you?

625
00:54:38,749 --> 00:54:43,546
We're brothers.
I follow you.

626
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,372
What can I do for you?

627
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,474
Thank you.

628
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,020
Here we go.

629
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:27,544
Here it is.

630
00:55:29,317 --> 00:55:30,856
I can't accept this.

631
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,638
You don't have to hesitate.

632
00:55:35,208 --> 00:55:40,927
But for future reference, please accept this in cash.

633
00:55:42,325 --> 00:55:42,849
But...

634
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:45,692
Please.

635
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,274
Hurry up.

636
00:55:53,853 --> 00:55:54,892
Thank you.

637
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:57,908
Excuse me.

638
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:00,407
Why don't you take a bath?

639
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:02,134
Please take him.

640
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,244
Enjoy your bath.

641
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:13,919
Minmin.

642
00:56:14,629 --> 00:56:18,293
Don't rush.
Go to bath first.

643
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:20,280
My important things are in this jacket.

644
00:56:20,484 --> 00:56:22,929
I'll take care of it.

645
00:56:27,709 --> 00:56:29,342
Go to bath.

646
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:40,483
Why don't we take a bath together again?

647
00:56:40,811 --> 00:56:45,553
I'll be there soon.
You go first.

648
00:57:04,648 --> 00:57:05,960
Why do you want to know Negoro's address?

649
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,195
Wanna see him?

650
00:57:11,734 --> 00:57:15,663
I haven't been able to sleep since you told me about his misfortune.

651
00:57:17,031 --> 00:57:20,945
I don't know what to say. I want to comfort you.

652
00:57:23,202 --> 00:57:24,648
Because you still love him.

653
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:28,632
But I can't stop my feeling.

654
00:57:31,085 --> 00:57:33,913
He left me without telling me why.

655
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:38,811
I hated him with every fiber of my being.

656
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:44,499
I made big mistake too.

657
00:57:47,093 --> 00:57:50,624
I want to meet him, but I think he'll give me a challenge.

658
00:57:56,862 --> 00:58:01,104
Here..
If you see him, I'd like you to tell him like this.

659
00:58:02,471 --> 00:58:04,588
I'm working hard to make up for my mistakes.

660
00:58:07,416 --> 00:58:09,268
So please be patient a little longer

661
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:11,252
Are you going yet?

662
00:58:12,362 --> 00:58:17,987
This year, in order to get engaged to you, I have to solve this problem.

663
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:25,463
Tenkaidai National Land...

664
00:58:28,134 --> 00:58:29,704
Hello,it's me.

665
00:58:30,743 --> 00:58:34,681
Is this Mr. Ishii from an industry magazine?

666
00:58:38,812 --> 00:58:40,734
I'm not good enough for it.

667
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:46,140
We definitely need you for this roundtable discussion.

668
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:51,568
A young reporter will pick you up at 5:30.

669
00:58:58,353 --> 00:58:59,127
Please.

670
00:59:19,542 --> 00:59:20,316
Get up.

671
00:59:24,128 --> 00:59:26,636
Koyama-san.
I'm glad you finally woke up.

672
00:59:28,711 --> 00:59:33,385
I'll get right to it.
You got the money from New Asia Development.

673
00:59:35,077 --> 00:59:36,977
Say the truth.

674
00:59:37,793 --> 00:59:43,633
During the day today, you cashed a check for 3 million yen at Sanba Bank

675
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:45,173
This is the photo.

676
00:59:46,946 --> 00:59:54,124
Then you put 1 million yen of it in a fixed term deposit at Sanba Bank
and another 100 to the Dairokujuroku Bank.

677
00:59:55,172 --> 00:59:59,306
And you put the remaining 100 into a loan trust at a large investment trust bank.

678
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:01,920
This is the photo.

679
01:00:08,994 --> 01:00:11,361
You admit the fact of corruption?

680
01:00:13,931 --> 01:00:15,825
Say Yes or no.

681
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:19,013
Say.

682
01:00:22,976 --> 01:00:25,409
We want you to talk everything what you've done.

683
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:35,530
Please.

684
01:00:44,209 --> 01:00:45,869
Don't you know where that is?

685
01:00:47,923 --> 01:00:56,387
That's what they did to me on the way there and on the way back. They put me under anesthesia.

686
01:00:58,747 --> 01:01:00,201
Were they 3 people?

687
01:01:00,534 --> 01:01:00,854
Yes.

688
01:01:01,707 --> 01:01:02,801
What kind of men?

689
01:01:04,544 --> 01:01:10,038
There was a guy who looked like YAKUZA, and another guy who looked like a businessman, And one other guy.

690
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,537
That other guy is suspicious.

691
01:01:14,851 --> 01:01:16,258
He wore dark glasses.

692
01:01:17,130 --> 01:01:21,810
You at least remember what he's like...
His moles, his hair.

693
01:01:22,722 --> 01:01:24,888
I remember nothing.

694
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:28,995
What did you tell them?

695
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:33,392
Everything.

696
01:01:35,218 --> 01:01:36,518
Everything?

697
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:58,508
Mr. Fukazawa of New Asia Development
You're calling from Tokyo.

698
01:01:59,082 --> 01:01:59,722
Who?

699
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,544
Hello, Fukazawa-san, is it?

700
01:02:07,964 --> 01:02:10,603
I have something I'd like you to listen to instead of music today

701
01:02:15,057 --> 01:02:20,090
I just did what NANBADA told me to do.

702
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:26,219
Of course, they knew if they accepted the money, they would have to obey him.

703
01:02:27,194 --> 01:02:28,220
I was wrong.

704
01:02:29,882 --> 01:02:31,215
I was something wrong.

705
01:02:35,185 --> 01:02:36,438
What do you think?

706
01:02:37,691 --> 01:02:39,531
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

707
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:42,777
My dad is calling me from the hell.

708
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:43,674
Your dad?

709
01:02:44,298 --> 01:02:45,998
My ex family.

710
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:48,691
You forget?

711
01:02:49,641 --> 01:02:54,388
A mother who cared for you died,
A family was taken from you.

712
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:58,012
So you are...

713
01:03:00,927 --> 01:03:06,560
Some of the gems you're collecting for your antennae. There must be some diamonds that hold a grudge.

714
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,550
I'll pay you back.

715
01:03:10,361 --> 01:03:11,181
See you then.

716
01:03:17,269 --> 01:03:20,889
Oh the person was he...

717
01:03:22,486 --> 01:03:25,066
Now he knows about me.

718
01:03:26,492 --> 01:03:28,132
We don't have time.

719
01:03:29,436 --> 01:03:30,829
Let's get started now.

720
01:03:32,839 --> 01:03:33,806
I'm looking forward to it.

721
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:38,573
Hey,Koyama was dead.

722
01:03:39,513 --> 01:03:43,213
I just heard it on the radio in the car.
He was found dead in a ditch in the river.

723
01:03:45,027 --> 01:03:45,920
They killed him.

724
01:03:46,220 --> 01:03:49,602
I didn't think they would kill him in a small mountain.

725
01:03:50,670 --> 01:03:53,377
I'll use my last trump card.

726
01:03:56,641 --> 01:03:57,654
See them in person.

727
01:04:02,593 --> 01:04:03,806
He wasn't in the car.

728
01:04:04,354 --> 01:04:04,780
No?

729
01:04:12,066 --> 01:04:13,699
Hello?
Oh you.

730
01:04:15,378 --> 01:04:21,311
I came in on the early shift and the boss rushed out with Sasaki and Yoshino.

731
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:22,904
They'll go far.

732
01:04:23,157 --> 01:04:23,624
Far?

733
01:04:25,423 --> 01:04:26,023
Where'd he go?

734
01:04:26,223 --> 01:04:28,930
He had them carry pistols.

735
01:04:29,859 --> 01:04:33,485
Besides, yesterday he was showing off this amazing diamond to the manager.

736
01:04:33,991 --> 01:04:35,944
He said it used to belong to his ex family.

737
01:04:36,418 --> 01:04:36,891
What?

738
01:04:40,363 --> 01:04:43,476
I see.
Thanks for telling me.

739
01:04:44,076 --> 01:04:46,936
Do you come tonight?

740
01:04:48,345 --> 01:04:51,372
You don't know?

741
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:56,944
Don't do anything dangerous.
I'm worried about you.

742
01:04:58,717 --> 01:05:05,410
Say something.
Hello? Hello? Hello?

743
01:05:13,641 --> 01:05:15,688
Oh ken. what?

744
01:05:16,849 --> 01:05:18,096
He doesn't get off?

745
01:05:18,729 --> 01:05:21,776
I've been looking for you a long time, I'm sure of it.
He's got to be a stopover.

746
01:05:23,412 --> 01:05:25,238
Go to Mt.Hakuun.

747
01:05:25,578 --> 01:05:26,392
Mt.Hakuun?

748
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:30,315
There's his Villa at the peak of there.

749
01:05:31,081 --> 01:05:33,634
I'm sure he goes there and he called Nanbada.

750
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:35,165
Nanbada too?

751
01:05:36,555 --> 01:05:39,322
I'm sure he's got everyone there working on a plan to deal with me.

752
01:05:40,774 --> 01:05:43,988
We'll break into there.
Come back now.

753
01:05:50,225 --> 01:05:50,691
Who?

754
01:06:07,387 --> 01:06:08,240
What can I do for you?

755
01:06:09,402 --> 01:06:13,842
I was confused but I wanted to see you.

756
01:06:15,728 --> 01:06:16,428
May I?

757
01:06:19,108 --> 01:06:19,581
Come in.

758
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:34,143
I am a man who has no use for your old sweet memories.

759
01:06:35,286 --> 01:06:37,673
I heard from Osaki about you.

760
01:06:41,437 --> 01:06:44,410
That was a dramatic story worthy of the collapse of a former family, wasn't it?

761
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,850
Don't say that.

762
01:06:49,745 --> 01:06:53,832
I don't know what you're talking about.
But I want to comfort you.

763
01:06:54,022 --> 01:06:55,935
It's too late.

764
01:06:57,816 --> 01:07:01,569
The one who stole my youth, stole you, stole my future.

765
01:07:02,943 --> 01:07:06,496
I can't stop about my frustration.

766
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:14,803
Please leave.
We live in a different world now.

767
01:07:15,893 --> 01:07:18,100
Outside of law and inside.

768
01:07:18,796 --> 01:07:25,216
I know this much.
What you're doing is wrong.

769
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:29,801
Please leave everything to OSAKI.

770
01:07:31,942 --> 01:07:36,169
I do things my way.

771
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:46,019
I may look like a crazy person.

772
01:07:52,768 --> 01:07:56,162
I have something to show you.
Can you follow me?

773
01:07:58,288 --> 01:07:58,814
Here.

774
01:08:04,107 --> 01:08:05,060
Mental hospital.

775
01:08:06,102 --> 01:08:11,009
Mentally ill patients, abandoned by their families, are being admitted to the hospital in a similar fashion to incarceration.

776
01:08:17,401 --> 01:08:20,034
Hey get out!

777
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:32,623
This way, please.

778
01:08:41,964 --> 01:08:48,524
Give me my XXXXXX!
Give me my XXXXXX!

779
01:08:56,802 --> 01:09:01,089
This is my last secret that I never told anyone.

780
01:09:05,634 --> 01:09:06,621
Money.

781
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:15,061
You see?
He's almost crazy.

782
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:18,518
I'm determined to get revenge in my own way.

783
01:09:23,590 --> 01:09:25,343
I'm going into the enemy's main camp.

784
01:09:26,405 --> 01:09:29,672
Lose or win, Osaki will have to handle it.

785
01:09:31,677 --> 01:09:33,717
Please give this to him.

786
01:09:35,832 --> 01:09:36,405
Nurse.

787
01:09:40,526 --> 01:09:43,312
Give that patient something good to eat with it.

788
01:09:44,032 --> 01:09:44,865
I beg you.

789
01:09:45,876 --> 01:09:47,822
I'll see you there.

790
01:10:22,991 --> 01:10:23,798
Here's here.

791
01:10:24,408 --> 01:10:25,522
Sorry I'm late.

792
01:10:26,383 --> 01:10:30,310
I finally find who he is.

793
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:31,820
Who?

794
01:10:32,979 --> 01:10:37,619
He is my ex family.
He is  my son in law.

795
01:10:38,595 --> 01:10:43,361
He's Negoro.
He was a nice young man who loved music when he was a student

796
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:44,765
Negoro...

797
01:10:52,493 --> 01:10:56,660
I just followed to Nanbada.

798
01:10:57,469 --> 01:11:02,509
Of course, they knew if they accepted the money, they would have to obey him.

799
01:11:03,825 --> 01:11:07,085
I was wrong.

800
01:11:09,026 --> 01:11:09,806
Then stopped.

801
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,974
This is enough.
He told you to go to The mountain?

802
01:11:16,142 --> 01:11:18,275
We have to find where Nanbada and Fukazawa are.

803
01:11:18,837 --> 01:11:21,323
Please find it.

804
01:11:22,865 --> 01:11:25,871
He has not come to the club?
Go to his apartment.

805
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,014
Bring him to here.

806
01:11:32,592 --> 01:11:34,912
He is spy.

807
01:11:35,772 --> 01:11:37,938
That's why he knew about us.

808
01:11:56,551 --> 01:11:58,378
To where?

809
01:11:58,872 --> 01:11:59,859
No operation at night.

810
01:12:00,396 --> 01:12:03,250
We are New Asia Development.
We have an urgent matter for Chairman Fukazawa.

811
01:12:46,768 --> 01:12:47,388
Here.

812
01:12:51,962 --> 01:12:53,389
This is Nanbata's car.

813
01:12:54,982 --> 01:12:55,675
Let's go!

814
01:13:18,110 --> 01:13:18,943
Freeze!

815
01:13:19,736 --> 01:13:20,376
Damn it!

816
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:21,590
He's fake.

817
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,913
Drop the pistol.

818
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:25,743
Stay away.

819
01:13:26,877 --> 01:13:28,143
I'll kill him.

820
01:13:33,808 --> 01:13:35,775
We knew you'd come.

821
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:39,567
Our customer was told to contact us.

822
01:13:40,270 --> 01:13:44,250
I've lost so far, but we'll win in the end.

823
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:46,178
Long time no see,Kyohei.

824
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:48,673
You grew up.

825
01:13:49,801 --> 01:13:52,508
You grew up on bad things.

826
01:13:54,886 --> 01:13:58,619
You seem to know too much about us that we don't want you to know.

827
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:01,526
I know about Ube and Koyama.

828
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:08,038
I sent my notes and the tape recording to the police before I came here.

829
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:10,270
Don't worry about it.

830
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:14,151
As long as this man is not alive, none of that stuff will works.

831
01:14:15,272 --> 01:14:17,452
I'll leave it to you.

832
01:14:18,325 --> 01:14:20,232
I'll go home by your car.

833
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:31,093
Are you Osaki?

834
01:14:31,612 --> 01:14:32,746
I think you have been contacted by the police.

835
01:14:33,272 --> 01:14:38,592
It will take you there in 1hour.
Unfortunately, sir, flying at night is forbidden.

836
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,606
Connect the line.

837
01:14:46,586 --> 01:14:49,706
The dynamite will explode in half an hour.

838
01:14:51,526 --> 01:14:52,346
See you.

839
01:14:53,825 --> 01:14:57,778
Anyone who has a grudge against the chairman will dynamite himself along with the house.

840
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,116
I will make the announcement.

841
01:15:04,832 --> 01:15:05,986
I feel good.

842
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:08,239
They are trembling now.

843
01:15:08,472 --> 01:15:09,726
It's been 15 minutes.

844
01:15:19,653 --> 01:15:21,340
There's a lighter in my pocket.

845
01:15:23,509 --> 01:15:24,556
Look at me.

846
01:15:31,846 --> 01:15:33,739
OK let's go.

847
01:15:38,239 --> 01:15:39,539
I have contacted Shizuoka Police.

848
01:15:40,066 --> 01:15:40,706
I get it.

849
01:15:57,494 --> 01:15:58,387
Hurry up.

850
01:16:02,489 --> 01:16:03,822
Fire my lope.

851
01:16:06,236 --> 01:16:06,922
Hurry up.

852
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:08,709
Hurry up.

853
01:16:12,012 --> 01:16:12,586
Hot!

854
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:13,799
Hurry up.

855
01:16:14,446 --> 01:16:15,152
Little above.

856
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:16,546
Okay.

857
01:16:17,726 --> 01:16:18,126
Hot!

858
01:16:28,326 --> 01:16:29,273
Come in.

859
01:16:30,293 --> 01:16:31,346
Three minutes left.

860
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:35,133
We can at least hear the sounds.
Let’s see.

861
01:16:38,213 --> 01:16:38,980
We have no time!

862
01:16:41,486 --> 01:16:41,959
Not yet?

863
01:16:44,946 --> 01:16:45,572
Hurry up.

864
01:17:00,936 --> 01:17:02,336
Hurry up.

865
01:17:10,350 --> 01:17:11,404
Hurry up.

866
01:17:15,171 --> 01:17:16,291
Not yet?

867
01:17:16,384 --> 01:17:17,531
Untie!

868
01:17:22,864 --> 01:17:23,724
Forty minutes now.

869
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:24,831
That's strange.

870
01:17:25,037 --> 01:17:26,464
Damn it.
They escaped?

871
01:17:27,732 --> 01:17:31,012
We have next choice.
Give me dynamite.

872
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:41,020
Connect this dynamite to the fuse.

873
01:17:44,033 --> 01:17:44,646
Are you alright?

874
01:17:44,739 --> 01:17:45,613
I'm alright.

875
01:17:46,046 --> 01:17:47,773
They could be waiting down there.

876
01:17:47,799 --> 01:17:50,179
In the case, I use this dynamite.

877
01:17:59,983 --> 01:18:00,670
It works.

878
01:18:03,156 --> 01:18:04,770
Damn it.
They did it.

879
01:18:05,071 --> 01:18:07,485
Ok let's do it.

880
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,549
Fukazawa!

881
01:18:32,398 --> 01:18:35,811
Just above him soon.
We are gonna set the dynamite on fire.

882
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:43,739
Shit!

883
01:18:53,521 --> 01:18:54,881
Try the next corner.

884
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:05,675
Now!

885
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:16,977
What's the hell?

886
01:19:30,604 --> 01:19:31,184
We made it!

887
01:19:36,272 --> 01:19:38,298
I hear something strange.
What's that?

888
01:19:39,562 --> 01:19:41,542
Stop the cable.

889
01:19:48,591 --> 01:19:49,264
What's wrong?

890
01:19:56,993 --> 01:20:00,306
Negoro?
That's nice you escaped.

891
01:20:01,387 --> 01:20:04,073
Wherever you go, We'll beat you.

892
01:20:05,012 --> 01:20:07,957
Fukazawa's car fell off a cliff.

893
01:20:08,614 --> 01:20:09,801
It's his grave.

894
01:20:10,113 --> 01:20:10,808
What?

895
01:20:23,676 --> 01:20:26,722
If that's true, I'm grateful.

896
01:20:27,176 --> 01:20:28,457
I will inherit all his work.

897
01:20:29,168 --> 01:20:29,949
You won't.

898
01:20:30,676 --> 01:20:35,535
What's the hell?
I put dynamite on the bottom cable.

899
01:20:35,996 --> 01:20:36,597
What?

900
01:20:41,132 --> 01:20:44,499
There's a fuse underneath.
Go to hell.

901
01:20:48,295 --> 01:20:49,217
Set the fire.

902
01:20:53,147 --> 01:20:55,366
It's ready.

903
01:20:55,662 --> 01:20:58,334
We will win.

904
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,537
Go to hell.

905
01:21:05,234 --> 01:21:07,000
Nanbada.

906
01:21:24,427 --> 01:21:25,443
Mr. Nambada, right?

907
01:21:25,982 --> 01:21:26,419
What?

908
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:30,115
I have a warrant for your arrest, please come with us.

909
01:21:30,529 --> 01:21:31,411
What?

910
01:21:35,119 --> 01:21:40,431
If they die, we have nothing to fear.
It's all Fukazawa's fault.

911
01:21:41,353 --> 01:21:42,400
Let's go.

912
01:21:49,736 --> 01:21:50,674
Look at that.

913
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:53,564
The fuse is burning.

914
01:21:59,912 --> 01:22:00,795
Shit.

915
01:22:04,037 --> 01:22:05,076
what is this sound?

916
01:22:07,303 --> 01:22:09,100
It's a helicopter.

917
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:14,647
Help us!

918
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:31,644
they are waving the flag.

919
01:22:32,379 --> 01:22:36,371
The cable car is stopped, so it might be an SOS signal.

920
01:22:47,783 --> 01:22:48,987
Oh he's Osaki.

921
01:22:49,401 --> 01:22:50,471
It's me.

922
01:22:52,838 --> 01:22:54,518
Oh Negoro.
What's happened?

923
01:22:55,283 --> 01:22:56,752
I'll get closer to them.

924
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:02,876
Osaki.

925
01:23:03,805 --> 01:23:06,266
Help us.

926
01:23:09,118 --> 01:23:10,899
They need our help.

927
01:23:11,188 --> 01:23:11,899
Please.

928
01:23:16,223 --> 01:23:18,559
Please give me a rope.

929
01:23:20,277 --> 01:23:22,699
Hurry up.

930
01:23:25,012 --> 01:23:27,191
Little right.

931
01:23:40,071 --> 01:23:41,118
Come on.

932
01:24:01,892 --> 01:24:02,704
You go first.

933
01:24:13,385 --> 01:24:15,596
Thanks, bros.

934
01:24:18,674 --> 01:24:19,338
Hurry up.

935
01:24:20,873 --> 01:24:21,599
Hurry up.

936
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:22,888
Hurry up.

937
01:24:35,499 --> 01:24:36,296
Negoro!

938
01:24:57,736 --> 01:24:58,501
Hurry up.

939
01:25:00,299 --> 01:25:02,518
That cable car will explode.

940
01:25:31,342 --> 01:25:32,053
I took him.

941
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:32,983
Thank you very much.

942
01:25:35,264 --> 01:25:36,233
Uncuff him.

943
01:25:37,522 --> 01:25:39,740
Can you leave from here?

944
01:25:49,913 --> 01:25:54,006
You need to talk with me again?
I've helped you enough.

945
01:25:55,046 --> 01:25:56,725
I have nothing more to say.

946
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,319
I'll be the one to tell you what happened today.

947
01:26:00,514 --> 01:26:03,702
Nambada just confessed to the UBE and Oyama's murder.

948
01:26:04,835 --> 01:26:06,530
Your Note worked.

949
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:09,186
The power of the law has finally come to light.

950
01:26:10,249 --> 01:26:13,217
If you'd been a little quicker, those two men wouldn't have been killed.

951
01:26:14,068 --> 01:26:15,311
So you're saying you won?

952
01:26:16,756 --> 01:26:18,452
You decide that.

953
01:26:20,941 --> 01:26:24,035
I look forward to seeing how you decide.

954
01:26:25,206 --> 01:26:28,597
Don't get me wrong.
The law is not perfect.

955
01:26:31,042 --> 01:26:42,003
But the important thing is not to take the back roads, but to create a society that respects the law with an open mind.

956
01:26:44,985 --> 01:26:49,407
Good people respect that.
I will judge you harshly.

957
01:26:51,432 --> 01:26:55,916
Please do that.
That's how I can be saved.

958
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:19,518
Cigarettes are so good when I get them from someone else.

959
01:27:21,799 --> 01:27:24,081
I didn't have any friends for a long time.

960
01:27:26,323 --> 01:27:27,370
How's Tomoko?

961
01:27:28,487 --> 01:27:32,846
She's getting on a plane to Hong Kong today.

962
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:34,721
Please have a wedding soon.

963
01:27:37,018 --> 01:27:43,807
It seems that she will go to Hong Kong for a change of scenery and come back.

964
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:51,130
That's good.

965
01:28:37,444 --> 01:28:46,578
THE END

Zoku zoku Judai no Seiten / Judai no Seiten 3 (1953)

3
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,674
Oh, it's the same, this morning.

4
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:50,894
What?

5
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:54,836
Well, you see, Kakcchan is coming from over there. It's been about three days since then

6
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,766
That's when we pass each other

7
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:59,367
He definitely bad to stare at my face like that

8
00:02:06,052 --> 00:02:06,892
He's bad student.

9
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:09,185
I'll glare at him.

10
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:20,019
Hey.

11
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,787
You've got rice stuck on your cheek, huh?

12
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:40,906
That was funny.

13
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,113
Good morning.

14
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,947
Asou and the others are late.

15
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,591
That's right, it's Tadokoro-san, isn't it?

16
00:03:01,399 --> 00:03:01,931
No, that's not it.

17
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:03,251
Hey come on.

18
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:05,703
She's coming now.

19
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,685
Good morning.

20
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,464
Good morning.

21
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:32,601
Good morning!

22
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,408
Good morning!

23
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:36,866
He came right on time

24
00:03:42,993 --> 00:03:45,993
Today we begin with Lesson 9, Chapter 3.

25
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:12,642
Otomo-kun

26
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:14,790
Please translate this into Japanese

27
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:28,740
He and she, or she and he, the elm tree....

28
00:04:32,045 --> 00:04:33,870
he and he, good good....

29
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:35,163
He and She

30
00:04:35,675 --> 00:04:37,149
He and She

31
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:42,898
With that attitude, you'll never be able to write a love letter, will you?

32
00:04:47,432 --> 00:04:49,672
Ms.Tadokoro.
Please say it in Japanese?

33
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:59,089
When the two first met

34
00:04:59,988 --> 00:05:04,548
Today he stands alone beneath that tree.

35
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:09,895
Whilst occasionally thinking of her

36
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:12,897
He was lonely there.

37
00:05:13,953 --> 00:05:17,008
She whispered softly

38
00:05:17,743 --> 00:05:19,717
Winds comes along

39
00:05:20,118 --> 00:05:21,238
Very good

40
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,448
She was in mood

41
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:33,825
She's pretty good

42
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:36,735
She must be with someone who has loved or experienced heartbreak

43
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,936
So she was in the mood like that

44
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,785
But honestly, that's true

45
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:41,956
You know? You lived with your sister

46
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,696
She live her sister who is a dancer in that apartment, right?

47
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,290
So It can't be helped.

48
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:48,256
That's a hurtful way to say it to someone like that

49
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,034
Stop it

50
00:05:50,813 --> 00:05:51,493
What's wrong?

51
00:05:53,147 --> 00:05:54,977
I don't understand why he is like that

52
00:05:55,818 --> 00:05:57,734
San-chan said something silly again.

53
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,609
I'm back!

54
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,766
Welcome home. It was hot, wasn't it?

55
00:06:16,031 --> 00:06:18,231
I can't wait for summer vacation to start

56
00:06:18,937 --> 00:06:21,937
That's right, it's the last summer vacation for you.

57
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,605
Hey, sister, living as a single woman...

58
00:06:36,106 --> 00:06:39,082
Isn't it just inevitable to become a dancer?

59
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,476
It can't be that simple, right?

60
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,531
So, do you do it because you like it?

61
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,486
Even my studies fee...

62
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:51,511
We can get by with your father's inheritance, right?

63
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:55,559
That's right.

64
00:06:56,065 --> 00:06:57,883
so does that mean you really do it because you like it?

65
00:06:58,842 --> 00:06:59,769
Not really,

66
00:07:00,415 --> 00:07:03,368
but I don't want you to work  for me like that.

67
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:07,651
it's just so frustrating to say

68
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,613
Don't be cheeky.

69
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,695
Rather, you clearly like doing it

70
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,135
It's really robust and healthy.

71
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:24,619
You know, what makes me happiest is that
Keiko-chan has no dark shadows and is so cheerful

72
00:07:25,059 --> 00:07:27,335
I really dislike crying baby

73
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,093
Well then, I'm off

74
00:07:43,513 --> 00:07:44,890
Welcome back home

75
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:48,865
Welcome back!

76
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:49,659
I'm home.

77
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:50,736
Welcome back,

78
00:07:50,907 --> 00:07:53,075
Setsuko. Today is the day for practice, isn't it?

79
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,010
The teacher is waiting, so please hurry up

80
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:56,557
Yes.

81
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:16,913
Setsuko

82
00:09:30,302 --> 00:09:31,465
Setsuko

83
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,712
What's wrong? Is something happening
during your practice?

84
00:09:40,941 --> 00:09:43,134
You act so bad

85
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:52,535
It's true that we haven't talked to you about this yet,

86
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,435
and we are at fault too

87
00:09:54,621 --> 00:09:57,880
Shingo is the heir of Arai, our business partner

88
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,436
you are no longer a child

89
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:03,162
and it's time to talk about your marriage

90
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:04,058
We also got enthusiastic about it

91
00:10:04,503 --> 00:10:07,503
I was thinking that maybe you guys should start dating around this time

92
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:10,825
So, does that mean we're engaged?

93
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:15,510
Well, that might have been the case in the past

94
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,097
These days, you don't have to think so rigidly about it

95
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,838
Well, I feel the same way

96
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,978
You want to raise her to be a daughter who is as disciplined as possible

97
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:33,735
But when it comes to an old established shop
like ours, is that really all there is to it?

98
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,236
I won't let you date someone who I think
is not good from a parent's perspective

99
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Shingo is a reliable young man, after all

100
00:10:43,948 --> 00:10:45,080
Oh, by the way,

101
00:10:46,253 --> 00:10:47,879
about the concert tickets,

102
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:54,068
you wouldn't want to go alone, right?

103
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:57,460
I got two of them.

104
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,353
You know? We meet him each other every morning

105
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:10,821
That was the guy called Kaku

106
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,328
Oh that guy

107
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:17,299
but suddenly and without permission....

108
00:11:17,569 --> 00:11:19,088
I absolutely oppose it too

109
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,033
Please be on my side, Chieko-san.

110
00:11:21,104 --> 00:11:22,064
Of course

111
00:11:22,699 --> 00:11:23,665
For Young women

112
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,156
There's no more restraint than this

113
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,298
That's right,

114
00:11:26,805 --> 00:11:29,155
what should we do about this?

115
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:31,296
Just break it!

116
00:11:31,326 --> 00:11:32,052
That's right.

117
00:11:32,445 --> 00:11:33,560
Well, what is that?

118
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:34,376
it's wonderful!

119
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,796
That's jazz from Sonan University

120
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,746
I want to go

121
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,466
How much?

122
00:11:37,491 --> 00:11:37,906
I'll give it to you

123
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:40,066
Really? Yeah, thanks!

124
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,565
Can you give me one?

125
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,212
Thinking about it,

126
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,415
it's a great opportunity

127
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,870
And he might be nice.

128
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,176
I have observed something on your behalf

129
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:01,848
If she comes, make sure to introduce me too

130
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,679
But I wonder if jazz is really suitable for a first-time place

131
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,754
does that mean Kabukiza is better?

132
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:10,695
In a place like that,

133
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,726
you won't even get a half-hearted response,

134
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:14,566
and you can't hold her hands either.

135
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:18,538
In that regard, jazz is like a jolt that shakes your heart, right?

136
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,366
Whether you hold her hands or touch feet,

137
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,811
there's nothing to be embarrassed about

138
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,599
Well, modern Miya is limited to jazz concerts

139
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,264
Hmph, is there really such?

140
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,177
But you did a good job, didn't you?

141
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,756
If you stick like that

142
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,086
I don't know how many years ahead,

143
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,932
but it's certain that she is nice.

144
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:38,095
Young women these days

145
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,536
they don't take it seriously

146
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,460
But do we have a responsibility
too?

147
00:12:42,674 --> 00:12:43,174
Hey

148
00:12:43,603 --> 00:12:44,458
They are waiting! Hurry up, hurry up!

149
00:12:45,346 --> 00:12:46,384
Oh see you.

150
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,469
I told you to calm down a bit

151
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,756
This is normal

152
00:13:14,952 --> 00:13:16,823
When I get excited, it's something else, isn't it?

153
00:13:16,904 --> 00:13:18,164
You're a troublesome person.

154
00:13:20,662 --> 00:13:22,095
B-12

155
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,631
hey we can't wait

156
00:13:43,821 --> 00:13:45,419
Isn't that seat incorrect? Yes,

157
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:48,334
there's no mistake about it

158
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:00,562
Kakcchan

159
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:19,501
Do you know him?
Introduce me.

160
00:15:19,816 --> 00:15:21,463
Please

161
00:15:40,254 --> 00:15:41,068
See you.

162
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:46,029
Please take care of her.

163
00:15:48,341 --> 00:15:49,068
Your lover?

164
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:49,573
No.

165
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:51,932
Please.

166
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:53,435
Please.

167
00:16:06,515 --> 00:16:07,277
Please

168
00:16:07,808 --> 00:16:08,782
Please.

169
00:16:09,288 --> 00:16:11,148
Please.

170
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:13,000
Arai

171
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,593
I know you were supposed to date with Setsuko.
Do you have enough money and time,right?

172
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,507
Yes.

173
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,513
Then we will go on behalf of her.

174
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:25,979
Let's go.

175
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:29,367
Welcome

176
00:16:31,913 --> 00:16:33,359
Here it is

177
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:47,714
What hobbies do you have?

178
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:49,821
Hmm, I guess fishing

179
00:16:52,132 --> 00:16:54,563
Have you had any friendships with women so far?

180
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:56,565
Not at all

181
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,248
I can trust those words, right?

182
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,925
Did you hear about the American data pose that came last time? Thank you

183
00:17:06,811 --> 00:17:07,258
No.

184
00:17:07,412 --> 00:17:08,353
Well, what about Quattro?

185
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,807
No.

186
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:09,866
Oh no.

187
00:17:10,703 --> 00:17:13,488
then you can't really talk,can you?

188
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,326
You're just a lazy person who doesn't even try

189
00:17:23,006 --> 00:17:27,627
If you get dumped by a girl friend, that's one thing, but to get dumped before you even say a word to your fiancée is something else

190
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,760
I thought someone like you would be a friend, but that was quick

191
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:38,974
But you know, I actually like the fact that Setsuko doesn't pay any attention to me

192
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:43,375
That's quite silly.

193
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,957
At least look back at me a little

194
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,152
If I just blow a little, girls gather around like a swarm

195
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,198
I'm really struggling with how to handle it.

196
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,399
Don't get too carried away and forget that you're a student

197
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,360
Getting carried away with popularity can lead to a halt in the essentials

198
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:18,799
The exam is until tomorrow, you know

199
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,430
Yes

200
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:21,036
Please make sure to do your best.

201
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,793
Yeah, that's fine,

202
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:24,155
but about going camping

203
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,479
You forgot again,didn't you?

204
00:18:25,859 --> 00:18:26,735
That's right

205
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,436
I'm definitely going to the bank today

206
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:30,208
You're a bit too carefree, you know

207
00:18:31,003 --> 00:18:35,174
The total for the reporter's fee, food expenses, and other miscellaneous costs is 3,500 yen

208
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,980
I want a little more pocket money, though

209
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:38,952
I'll give it to you

210
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:41,566
Since we're all going to Kawamura tomorrow, so don't forget!

211
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,967
It's okay

212
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,873
Take care.

213
00:18:53,156 --> 00:18:56,694
Women need someone they can rely on

214
00:18:59,485 --> 00:19:01,517
It's tough to live alone, you know

215
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,209
You don't have to worry about living expenses

216
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,119
Cheers to Cherio

217
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,607
Soon it will be time for today's broadcast to end completely

218
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:40,910
Well then, everyone, good night and sweet dreams

219
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,607
Good morning, everyone in the countryside

220
00:19:59,030 --> 00:19:59,911
It's an early bird

221
00:20:52,037 --> 00:20:53,411
What's wrong?

222
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,253
Hey, this is the money for the camping trip

223
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,687
I don't want this money

224
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:14,367
This isn't bank money, is it?

225
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,148
Whose money is this?

226
00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:19,454
What kind of money is this?

227
00:21:22,783 --> 00:21:30,100
Keiko-chan, the truth is that the money
from the bank has long been gone

228
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,221
I'm sorry for keeping it quiet,

229
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:45,115
but I didn't want to worry you, Keiko-chan

230
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:51,856
Well then,my tuition too?

231
00:22:00,162 --> 00:22:01,128
Sister.

232
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:06,280
I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry, I'm sorry, big sister

233
00:22:09,437 --> 00:22:12,029
It's nothing like that

234
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:18,512
I will leave school and work.

235
00:22:21,045 --> 00:22:21,975
How foolish

236
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,345
If you did that, then I'd be in trouble.

237
00:22:30,246 --> 00:22:31,932
You understand, right, Keiko-chan?

238
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,044
How wonderful it would have been
if we were men brothers

239
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:48,765
No, I shouldn't think miserably just because we are women

240
00:22:49,393 --> 00:22:50,706
You're right, Keiko-chan. From now on,

241
00:22:51,499 --> 00:22:52,739
You're right.

242
00:22:54,762 --> 00:23:00,940
I'll share everything and consult with you since you've grown up so much

243
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,363
I've been looking forward to this for a long time

244
00:23:04,659 --> 00:23:08,197
Right now, I really feel like I'm all alone

245
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,900
So please go have a great time
camping with this money,

246
00:23:14,086 --> 00:23:17,086
but this money...

247
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,135
Keiko-chan

248
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:26,870
This money was given to me by someone who might become Keiko-chan's older brother

249
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,083
Please don't ask me anything today

250
00:23:34,866 --> 00:23:36,251
You have an exam coming up, right?

251
00:23:37,337 --> 00:23:38,051
Get ready.

252
00:24:00,751 --> 00:24:03,751
You seem really confident! That's amazing

253
00:24:05,993 --> 00:24:07,243
You stayed up all night studying

254
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:08,469
Your eyes are swollen

255
00:24:10,243 --> 00:24:11,275
Because I cried

256
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,676
Even Keiko-chan cries

257
00:24:14,965 --> 00:24:15,771
You are definitely a girl after all

258
00:26:11,458 --> 00:26:12,488
Keiko-chan

259
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,349
What are you going to do with this?

260
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:35,747
I was in the wrong

261
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,646
I'm asking why you wrote it

262
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,388
Please give me any punishment

263
00:26:40,915 --> 00:26:43,915
Answer my question

264
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:49,295
Come in.

265
00:27:07,114 --> 00:27:10,130
I asked him to tell me

266
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,099
That's not true.

267
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,806
I did it on my own

268
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:13,935
No, it was my fault

269
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,083
I understand, I understand. I'm not a judge

270
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:21,169
I clearly acknowledge the cheating mistake,

271
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:24,778
but at the same time, I also greatly recognize the friendship you all have in trying to cover for each other.

272
00:27:25,131 --> 00:27:25,834
However,

273
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:32,380
Let me say this: from now on, Tadokoro-san, you should not be too grateful for Kajikawa-kun's actions

274
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,482
And Kajikawa-kun, you should not think of your actions as heroic and get carried away by that

275
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,216
To put it bluntly, you both understand this because you are male and female students in the same class

276
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:49,843
Alright? then go home.

277
00:28:20,537 --> 00:28:23,076
If you go camping, the mood will be more in tune with the secret.

278
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,976
We are gathering and making plans

279
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,336
Hurry up and come

280
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:34,756
It's a 20-minute break,

281
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,841
but it's too early

282
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:57,828
Nanika-chan! It's dangerous! Hey!

283
00:29:00,084 --> 00:29:01,982
Watch out.

284
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,496
Watch out.

285
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:09,481
Watch out.

286
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,964
Come on.

287
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:27,895
Damn it.

288
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:31,371
Oh shit.

289
00:29:44,223 --> 00:29:45,926
hey

290
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:49,347
it's mealtime

291
00:29:51,442 --> 00:29:52,926
it's mealtime

292
00:29:52,995 --> 00:29:55,995
That's right, if I told you to stop,

293
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,676
then stop it

294
00:29:57,442 --> 00:29:58,228
There's no competition,

295
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,046
there's no competition,

296
00:29:59,071 --> 00:30:00,339
Just stop it.

297
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,222
No competition!

298
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:05,848
Just stop it.

299
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:07,113
Just stop it.

300
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:09,527
it's mealtime

301
00:30:13,324 --> 00:30:14,098
i am tired.

302
00:30:14,762 --> 00:30:16,004
Come here

303
00:30:16,907 --> 00:30:18,004
You guys go back by boat first.

304
00:30:18,029 --> 00:30:19,293
I'll swim

305
00:30:19,957 --> 00:30:22,088
That's not fair.

306
00:30:24,441 --> 00:30:25,149
That's not fair.

307
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,934
That's not fair.

308
00:30:29,723 --> 00:30:30,746
Let's go.

309
00:31:52,214 --> 00:31:53,004
Tan-chan

310
00:31:53,621 --> 00:31:54,465
Is there any problem with food?

311
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,894
Don't fail at cooking like yesterday

312
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:58,756
It should be okay today, right?

313
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,286
It's okay, I cooked well

314
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,004
Is that so?

315
00:32:05,692 --> 00:32:06,746
It's over baked

316
00:32:10,988 --> 00:32:11,895
Were you sleeping?

317
00:32:22,027 --> 00:32:24,457
Ah, I'm hungry, ah, I'm tired, let's eat now

318
00:32:24,815 --> 00:32:26,675
Look, we can't eat it

319
00:32:26,871 --> 00:32:28,145
Oh my god.

320
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,011
He always burns the rice

321
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,511
You should stop cooking.

322
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,050
Thank you, I can play

323
00:32:34,324 --> 00:32:35,027
Idiot!

324
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:37,254
You have to practice cooking meals.

325
00:32:37,826 --> 00:32:39,339
It's not my fault,

326
00:32:39,835 --> 00:32:42,323
the assistant escaped while I was sleeping

327
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:43,418
You idiot!

328
00:32:49,184 --> 00:32:51,231
Isn't there a guy named Masae Nishiaki?

329
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:53,254
Ah?

330
00:32:53,621 --> 00:32:55,395
Masae Nishiaki?

331
00:32:55,747 --> 00:32:56,941
For the camp?

332
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,355
but it seems like she hadn't come

333
00:33:02,903 --> 00:33:04,793
Really? That's strange

334
00:33:04,818 --> 00:33:07,027
She should definitely be here, though.

335
00:33:15,379 --> 00:33:15,918
Hi.

336
00:33:19,941 --> 00:33:20,949
What's wrong?

337
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,293
Look, this was from the girl who came with you someday

338
00:33:24,778 --> 00:33:25,832
she definitely wants me to come too

339
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,652
It seems like your girl too is joining us

340
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:29,675
What do you think?

341
00:33:30,033 --> 00:33:31,347
Shall we go together?

342
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,166
It seems that there was a mistake with the venue for the jazz competition the other day

343
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:41,190
This time, we're going to switch things up and talk about the romantic side

344
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,691
Let's go.

345
00:34:01,761 --> 00:34:03,590
Let's make sure to take this opportunity tomorrow

346
00:34:03,615 --> 00:34:05,226
I don't know which room it is,

347
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,151
but leave it to me.

348
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,230
What are you going to do?

349
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:09,136
Leave it to me.

350
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:19,620
See?

351
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,503
Just as I aimed

352
00:34:38,050 --> 00:34:38,831
I see

353
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,448
Oh, you're here! Yay,

354
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,120
I'm so happy!

355
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,116
You really came!

356
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,432
I was allowed to come early

357
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,792
I'm going to wake everyone up,

358
00:34:49,817 --> 00:34:50,698
so how about a party?

359
00:34:51,023 --> 00:34:52,783
We can have an overnight
around the camp room!

360
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:53,792
Right? Sounds great!

361
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:57,839
Everyone, wake up!

362
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:03,893
Wake up! It's still too early to sleep! Hurry up!

363
00:35:12,305 --> 00:35:13,870
Can you hear that? Let's dance!

364
00:35:14,141 --> 00:35:17,088
Let's make a fire! It's going to be romantic.

365
00:35:17,113 --> 00:35:17,839
Okay!

366
00:36:14,887 --> 00:36:18,534
You promised to teach me how to dance

367
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,496
You should watch the fire.

368
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,761
I'm counting on you not to put out the fire!

369
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,948
It's not funny

370
00:36:34,683 --> 00:36:36,128
so please dance with me later.

371
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,292
Sure.

372
00:36:38,972 --> 00:36:39,956
Do you know him?

373
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,550
Well, a little.

374
00:36:44,205 --> 00:36:47,557
Who is Asao Setsuko?

375
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:51,921
Look,there's that person over there

376
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,070
Get it together, or I'm going to lose my mood

377
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:07,876
Ah, welcome,

378
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,706
Good evening.

379
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,016
You know a lot of people

380
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,940
Not really.

381
00:37:29,917 --> 00:37:30,808
Good evening.

382
00:37:35,658 --> 00:37:38,658
So everyone, are you guys going to hang out all night?

383
00:37:38,914 --> 00:37:41,060
Let's take turns swapping partners and dance

384
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,464
Please woman choose.

385
00:37:45,214 --> 00:37:46,495
I choose you,Sayama.

386
00:37:46,792 --> 00:37:47,933
I mean, everyone has changed partners,

387
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,256
We have to change too

388
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,280
No way, other people don't share your interests at all

389
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:53,245
You must dance with me.

390
00:38:05,553 --> 00:38:07,425
Keiko-chan looks like she's having a blast

391
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,113
I make a fire

392
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,784
I almost want to turn off the fire.

393
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,550
Doesn't Setsuko-san completely dislike me?

394
00:38:24,821 --> 00:38:26,577
I don't think that's the case.

395
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,566
But you haven't really been dating at all, right?

396
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,590
Then why does she avoid me?

397
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,206
In other words,

398
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,221
for us, love is incredibly romantic and emotional

399
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,713
But when it comes to marriage,

400
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,448
it feels different...

401
00:38:43,473 --> 00:38:44,393
and it's physiological, right?

402
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:46,080
Physiological?

403
00:38:47,339 --> 00:38:48,378
That's right

404
00:38:48,403 --> 00:38:51,089
So when you suddenly say you're engaged like that,

405
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,448
it totally ruins the romance,

406
00:38:53,617 --> 00:38:54,526
you know?

407
00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,831
This is the perfect opportunity!

408
00:39:16,057 --> 00:39:16,967
Who?

409
00:39:17,413 --> 00:39:18,995
It's me, Shingo

410
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:27,534
Setsuko, I have something I want to talk to you about

411
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,050
I can hear you from here, please don't come in

412
00:39:31,610 --> 00:39:37,909
I want to date you again, not just as a fiancee or anything like that

413
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,589
Isn't it the same?

414
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:46,940
My first impression might have been bad,but I don't intend
to be the kind of man who you would dislike from the start

415
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:50,857
But it's impossible to suddenly say that I should just like you

416
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,447
Please leave.

417
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,736
But Keiko is already an adult;

418
00:40:16,018 --> 00:40:18,904
she thinks she can understand everything about her older sister

419
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,916
I wonder what kind of person will become my older brother.

420
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:27,174
I wonder what kind of person will become
Keiko's older brother.

421
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:12,877
Arai.

422
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:21,013
Oh, it seems like things didn't go well with Setsuko-san?

423
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:28,635
It seems that every time I meet that person, I leave an increasingly bad impression

424
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:30,174
You think too much.

425
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:10,994
Wa!

426
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:14,995
You're not surprised at all, huh?

427
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:17,491
Of course, you're so childish.

428
00:43:17,776 --> 00:43:19,237
You are calm

429
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:22,643
What do you want to talk about?

430
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:24,685
Speaking of which, I...

431
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,470
I thought the camp would be even more fun

432
00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:30,979
Because isn't this the best we can do?

433
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,291
It's actually quite fun

434
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,886
We are not just childish.

435
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,006
We can't just be giggling from morning till night, can we?

436
00:43:39,031 --> 00:43:40,385
It's not like that

437
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:42,775
Even if I stay quiet

438
00:43:42,823 --> 00:43:43,783
There are fun things

439
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:46,854
I wonder what they could be

440
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,250
I'll be clear, but you're only talking to the university students who came later, aren't you?

441
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:56,335
I really dislike people who try to monopolize friendships like that

442
00:43:56,367 --> 00:43:57,541
I am not monopolizing

443
00:43:58,846 --> 00:44:03,049
I just think I have a special friendship with Keiko-chan

444
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:08,495
So that means you like me, right?

445
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:08,987
Yeah

446
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,309
I like you too

447
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:13,893
I might really like you

448
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:17,660
But only as friends

449
00:44:18,268 --> 00:44:19,081
of course

450
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:24,557
But you know, when we reach our age,

451
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:29,229
there are times when we can't just limit ourselves to friendship issues anymore

452
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,666
So, is it about love?

453
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,619
No, it's something much bigger

454
00:44:32,644 --> 00:44:34,000
Marriage? Yeah

455
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:35,385
Well, it's kind of like that

456
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,572
You and I, we have friendship...

457
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:38,799
Don't get me wrong.

458
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,643
I'm talking about Setsuko-san.

459
00:44:41,827 --> 00:44:44,080
What? I was surprised.

460
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:49,845
Wait, Masai-kun, let's go together

461
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:50,498
No way

462
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,856
I'm all alone here

463
00:44:51,881 --> 00:44:53,144
It's because you oversleep.

464
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:09,713
Oh you.

465
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:11,636
Even though I came,

466
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,536
you forced a nonchalant face

467
00:45:15,676 --> 00:45:18,986
Hey, hey, Do not enter without permission

468
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,266
Why don't you come closer to us?

469
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,057
My partner is totally against it, you know

470
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:26,112
That person is very stubborn.

471
00:45:27,031 --> 00:45:30,031
I wonder Why are you unattractive?

472
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:31,996
See how it goes

473
00:45:32,021 --> 00:45:33,518
I'm still 18, you know

474
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,660
But your friends have a bit more charm, you know

475
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,086
Well, nobody wants to hang out with someone like you

476
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:42,996
What are you talking about?

477
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:45,846
I always flirt with the women I like.

478
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:47,157
But I'm not ready for that.

479
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:49,346
You are like a male lion

480
00:45:52,986 --> 00:45:54,494
Oh, Do you do photo?

481
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:55,729
Of course

482
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,326
Are you taking a picture of me?

483
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:57,976
Sorry about that

484
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,076
I'm not like those amateurs around here

485
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,306
I don't want to waste film on things I'm not interested in.

486
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:03,963
Damn it.

487
00:46:04,565 --> 00:46:06,316
Please just go home, okay?

488
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:07,646
I'm sleepy again

489
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:08,386
Then can you give this to me?

490
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:09,846
No, this is my life

491
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:12,447
Well then, let's play with one more

492
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,665
Please play it somewhere far away

493
00:46:18,713 --> 00:46:20,307
I can smell Morio-san

494
00:46:22,818 --> 00:46:25,104
She's trying to be sexy.

495
00:46:35,487 --> 00:46:36,940
Is that so?

496
00:46:37,557 --> 00:46:38,182
Yeah.

497
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:46,802
What are you thinking?

498
00:46:48,411 --> 00:46:51,007
Just something about the future, I guess

499
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,336
What about you?

500
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,252
 Since the day I were born until now

501
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:01,361
We were thinking about a lifetime.

502
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:03,119
Right,

503
00:47:05,807 --> 00:47:06,963
life...

504
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,432
Help me.

505
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,521
Pull yourself together!

506
00:50:21,538 --> 00:50:23,408
Pull yourself together!

507
00:50:27,210 --> 00:50:28,565
Setsuko!

508
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:32,760
Setsuko!

509
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:34,979
Pull yourself together!

510
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:46,916
Setsuko!

511
00:50:53,628 --> 00:50:54,354
Setsuko!

512
00:50:55,632 --> 00:50:56,510
Pull yourself together!

513
00:51:03,758 --> 00:51:04,549
Setsuko!

514
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:10,034
Setsuko.

515
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:05,455
She is unconscious,

516
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:13,104
I have done something bad

517
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:22,260
Hey,

518
00:52:24,410 --> 00:52:25,205
what's wrong?

519
00:52:38,773 --> 00:52:41,150
Please, take Setsuko with you

520
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:30,104
Excuse me.

521
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,498
Are you okay already?

522
00:53:34,506 --> 00:53:36,130
I caused a lot of worry last night

523
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:39,220
They say that once someone has nearly drowned, they tend to live a long life

524
00:53:39,881 --> 00:53:41,358
You don't have to worry anymore

525
00:53:42,300 --> 00:53:44,616
I actually have a hobby for something like this

526
00:53:44,641 --> 00:53:47,641
What do you think? Just one picture would be fine, right?

527
00:53:54,114 --> 00:53:59,608
Keiko, I was asked by Morio to be a model for a photo

528
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:02,467
I thought it would be something like that

529
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,217
He wants me to wear a swimsuit

530
00:54:08,381 --> 00:54:10,303
Setsuko, I'll tell this

531
00:54:10,967 --> 00:54:12,990
you have a weakness
because he could help you, right?

532
00:54:13,498 --> 00:54:14,986
You never know
what might happen

533
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:18,010
Well, I don't think it's that exaggerated, you know

534
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,766
Photography is that person's hobby

535
00:54:21,686 --> 00:54:23,790
Come on, that's a weakness.

536
00:54:23,815 --> 00:54:27,940
If I were a man,I would try to seduce you
with this opportunity right now

537
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,139
You think too much.

538
00:54:29,525 --> 00:54:31,420
Leave it to me, Keiko, okay?

539
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:51,624
Sayama?

540
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:56,598
Thank you for waiting.

541
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,356
Setsuko suddenly got a stomach ache

542
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,655
It was cold yesterday

543
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,926
So I came in place of you, is that okay?

544
00:55:06,155 --> 00:55:09,311
both of us have two arms and two legs, not much difference, right?

545
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,756
That's true, but I...

546
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:15,366
are you saying my body isn't artistic?

547
00:55:15,491 --> 00:55:16,147
No...

548
00:55:16,172 --> 00:55:18,629
it's your skill to capture that artistically

549
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,881
Just turn that way for a moment, I'm going to change

550
00:55:23,217 --> 00:55:24,287
Off-limits!

551
00:55:38,022 --> 00:55:38,788
I'm ready.

552
00:55:44,483 --> 00:55:45,590
So, where should we take the picture?

553
00:55:46,896 --> 00:55:48,595
Since I all the way to wear this

554
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:51,620
It has to be in the water, right? You should get in

555
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:52,636
I'm fine here

556
00:55:52,694 --> 00:55:54,413
Hey come on

557
00:55:54,467 --> 00:55:55,396
I will

558
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:57,076
Stop complaining and hurry up and come in,

559
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:57,647
I got it

560
00:55:58,093 --> 00:55:58,952
Hurry up.

561
00:55:58,977 --> 00:56:00,850
You don't have to drag this out

562
00:56:01,553 --> 00:56:02,764
Here's fine

563
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:04,006
I got wet.

564
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:05,143
Like this?

565
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:06,787
I think this is better.

566
00:56:06,834 --> 00:56:07,502
Wait a minute

567
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:11,123
My profile looks
really artistic from this angle

568
00:56:11,148 --> 00:56:13,787
Could you move a little further over there?

569
00:56:15,891 --> 00:56:17,365
The background here is not great

570
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,343
Could you pass a bit further over there?

571
00:56:20,023 --> 00:56:21,046
Just a little more, one more step,

572
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:23,725
one more step

573
00:56:28,861 --> 00:56:32,139
Keiko really did change into her swimsuit there.

574
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:33,428
Is that really true? Something like that?

575
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:36,199
It's true, and she looked really happy about it

576
00:56:36,444 --> 00:56:39,553
I have a weak heart, so I almost fainted.

577
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:40,856
If that's true,

578
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,056
That's unpleasant for us

579
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,709
So it's easy to get suspicious when a woman and a man are together.

580
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:45,616
Just look at that situation

581
00:56:45,686 --> 00:56:48,686
I feel like I can imagine what happened after that,

582
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:51,685
but I think that kind of imagination is too terrible

583
00:56:52,513 --> 00:56:54,115
Do you think what I'm saying is wrong?

584
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:56,163
Is that really the case?

585
00:56:56,648 --> 00:56:58,373
Hey, San-chan,What do you think?

586
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:01,905
Yeah, She's growing up very precociously

587
00:57:02,464 --> 00:57:03,553
It's a family problem for her

588
00:57:05,832 --> 00:57:06,967
Don't say such a ridiculous thing.

589
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,343
Where has Setsuko gone, Hajikawa?

590
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:23,936
What's wrong?

591
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:24,478
Don't try to dodge the issue

592
00:57:25,787 --> 00:57:27,600
Oh, for what?

593
00:57:28,749 --> 00:57:29,678
What have you been up to until now?

594
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:33,765
I'm serious, I never thought you were that kind of person.

595
00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:34,725
Wait a minute

596
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,131
Something happened to you since that day

597
00:57:37,490 --> 00:57:39,303
Wow, that's terrible

598
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,586
You deceived me and betrayed me

599
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:43,217
Wait

600
00:57:43,491 --> 00:57:44,343
Don't touch me.

601
00:57:50,249 --> 00:57:51,374
Are you feeling okay?

602
00:57:53,076 --> 00:57:54,768
I was lying

603
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:56,608
I was really worried

604
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,075
I'm sorry, even though I promised.

605
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,038
it's fine

606
00:58:01,389 --> 00:58:02,443
What about you, Keiko?

607
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:03,678
she just went home a little while ago

608
00:58:05,056 --> 00:58:05,850
Well then

609
00:58:06,077 --> 00:58:06,944
Setsuko

610
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:09,749
I'm into jazz

611
00:58:09,910 --> 00:58:11,373
You are definitely into
classical music, right?

612
00:58:12,862 --> 00:58:15,990
I've been wanting to have a
good chat about music sometime

613
00:58:16,562 --> 00:58:18,748
I'll be waiting for you tonight at the pine tree.

614
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:19,553
OK?

615
00:58:20,607 --> 00:58:23,037
Keep secret to Keiko

616
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,412
Just wait, wait for me!

617
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:31,537
Kajikawa-san

618
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:32,748
Listen to me

619
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:36,702
Kajikawa-san

620
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:40,330
Please, Kajikawa-san

621
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:42,647
Wait for me

622
00:58:43,093 --> 00:58:43,983
Kajikawa-san

623
00:58:52,884 --> 00:58:53,811
Kajikawa-san

624
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,026
Please

625
00:59:08,889 --> 00:59:10,272
Listen to me

626
00:59:14,744 --> 00:59:15,709
Believe me

627
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:18,686
I believe in you.

628
00:59:22,882 --> 00:59:23,952
Kajikawa-san

629
00:59:25,373 --> 00:59:27,545
Keiko....I....

630
01:00:10,637 --> 01:00:12,780
They are having festival there.

631
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:19,269
It's nice to have music coming across the lake

632
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:48,342
Do you remember what happened last night?

633
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,034
Setsuko

634
01:01:16,797 --> 01:01:19,670
no! Let go! Let go!

635
01:01:26,763 --> 01:01:29,982
You kissed me

636
01:02:22,574 --> 01:02:25,574
please listen to me,Sayama

637
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,194
I suffered all night long

638
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:30,928
Even so, I still can't help but feel pain

639
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,600
When Setsuko-san lost consciousness

640
01:02:35,625 --> 01:02:36,671
I kissed her.

641
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:43,616
I'm so bad

642
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:47,631
I really feel like a criminal

643
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,030
What the hell am I supposed to do?

644
01:02:53,038 --> 01:02:54,194
I....

645
01:02:56,650 --> 01:02:58,467
Moreover I like Setsuko-san

646
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:01,436
It's not about being engaged or anything like that

647
01:03:03,730 --> 01:03:08,045
Sayama, do you think if I honestly apologize to Setsuko-san, she will forgive me?

648
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:15,389
I might be hated or despised

649
01:03:18,870 --> 01:03:21,870
But still, I can't just stay silent

650
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:25,420
I'm going to go and apologize

651
01:03:26,850 --> 01:03:27,686
Arai

652
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:32,085
Arai

653
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,835
Setsuko-san

654
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:12,186
Please forgive me

655
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:19,920
I did something terrible out of a sense of relief thinking I could help you

656
01:04:39,170 --> 01:04:40,334
Please go home

657
01:05:17,725 --> 01:05:20,286
Hey everyone! Setsuko has gone
somewhere with her bag?

658
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:21,881
Didn't she go home alone?

659
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:23,788
That can't be right

660
01:05:24,037 --> 01:05:26,069
if she were going home, she should
have properly told me before leaving.

661
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:29,739
That's right, there's no way she would
go home alone.  we always act as a group.

662
01:05:29,850 --> 01:05:30,986
That's right

663
01:05:31,342 --> 01:05:32,896
I don't know
if she went home or not,

664
01:05:32,920 --> 01:05:35,920
but she walked towards the lake

665
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,342
I wonder it's strange

666
01:05:37,538 --> 01:05:38,671
what's wrong?

667
01:05:38,835 --> 01:05:40,272
it's strange.

668
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:41,983
She was acting strange earlier

669
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:42,843
Was she?

670
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,626
Well, anyway, let's all look for her together

671
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:45,856
What should we do?

672
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:48,406
Where? Towards the lone pine?

673
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:49,951
And she's gone towards the hill

674
01:05:50,136 --> 01:05:51,756
Let's go over there.

675
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:18,452
Setsuko!

676
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,866
Setsuko!

677
01:06:25,053 --> 01:06:26,522
Setsuko!

678
01:06:27,264 --> 01:06:28,921
Setsuko!

679
01:06:29,530 --> 01:06:32,444
Setsuko!

680
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:35,084
Setsuko!

681
01:06:35,590 --> 01:06:39,326
Setsuko! Setsuko!

682
01:06:45,255 --> 01:06:46,623
How was it? She's not over there,

683
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:47,376
what about here?

684
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,155
I have to take a call at this hotel

685
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:50,248
so everyone,please help her out, okay?

686
01:06:50,312 --> 01:06:51,788
What should we do?

687
01:06:51,813 --> 01:06:53,006
Then let's split up and search!

688
01:06:53,031 --> 01:06:54,100
Hacchan,which way are you going?

689
01:06:54,125 --> 01:06:55,717
let's go there.

690
01:06:57,374 --> 01:06:58,827
Setsuko!

691
01:07:02,046 --> 01:07:03,655
Setsuko!

692
01:07:03,757 --> 01:07:04,741
What's wrong with Setsuko?

693
01:07:04,773 --> 01:07:05,905
We can't find her.

694
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:07,952
Setsuko!

695
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,725
Setsuko!

696
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:11,819
Setsuko!

697
01:07:16,319 --> 01:07:17,811
Setsuko!

698
01:07:41,207 --> 01:07:42,420
Setsuko!

699
01:07:44,553 --> 01:07:45,303
Arai.

700
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:49,570
Do you know where Setsuko is?

701
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:50,896
What's wrong?

702
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,131
She's not here, she's disappeared

703
01:07:57,530 --> 01:07:58,475
It must be my fault

704
01:07:59,796 --> 01:08:00,350
Arai

705
01:08:02,084 --> 01:08:03,444
I'm sorry

706
01:08:06,647 --> 01:08:11,405
She thought I had helped her.

707
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:15,272
I took advantage of that,

708
01:08:16,828 --> 01:08:17,764
so what did you do?

709
01:08:21,343 --> 01:08:22,905
I have done something that cannot be undone.

710
01:08:29,632 --> 01:08:30,389
Please forgive me

711
01:08:45,975 --> 01:08:46,694
You.

712
01:08:50,835 --> 01:08:51,788
You.

713
01:08:55,725 --> 01:08:57,319
You bastard!

714
01:08:59,826 --> 01:09:02,381
I'm sorry, please forgive me

715
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,311
What good does it do for you to apologize to me!

716
01:09:10,650 --> 01:09:14,756
Are you even human!

717
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:21,342
Someone like you deserves to die!

718
01:09:28,637 --> 01:09:32,912
You might not die,

719
01:09:35,702 --> 01:09:40,577
but Setsuko might have die

720
01:10:09,732 --> 01:10:12,732
I did something really bad....

721
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:27,296
Hello? Was she definitely on that train?

722
01:10:27,946 --> 01:10:31,647
Hello, what time is the next train to Tokyo?

723
01:10:33,924 --> 01:10:35,123
Is that train available until tomorrow morning?

724
01:10:44,459 --> 01:10:45,186
Hello?

725
01:10:47,272 --> 01:10:49,960
Hello?
Is there a train to Tokyo?

726
01:11:02,825 --> 01:11:04,718
Hello, let's say the next match is tomorrow

727
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,856
No, this time it means I have to do it

728
01:11:09,644 --> 01:11:10,772
Well then, excuse me

729
01:11:36,260 --> 01:11:39,030
Hello, this is Aso

730
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:41,889
Ah, this is Setsuko's mother

731
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:45,287
Is Setsuko there? Hello?

732
01:11:46,490 --> 01:11:49,086
She was supposed to arrive
alone on the last train at 10 o'clock?

733
01:11:49,111 --> 01:11:50,671
Hello?

734
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:53,257
Hello?

735
01:11:53,663 --> 01:11:54,335
Hello?

736
01:11:54,553 --> 01:11:56,029
What's wrong?

737
01:11:56,694 --> 01:12:01,217
It seems she arrived at the station on the last train.
What happened to her?

738
01:12:02,044 --> 01:12:03,444
It's already been two hours

739
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:06,717
I wonder what happened.

740
01:12:07,046 --> 01:12:09,436
Hello?

741
01:12:53,321 --> 01:12:56,321
What's wrong, young lady?

742
01:12:58,301 --> 01:13:00,302
Did you run out of the house
after being scolded by your father?

743
01:13:04,470 --> 01:13:05,787
Do you have a place to stay?

744
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:14,856
If you don't have anywhere to go,

745
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,053
my sister's house is nearby

746
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:18,733
Wanna come?

747
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:28,295
Let's go, okay?

748
01:13:29,113 --> 01:13:30,631
It's dangerous for a woman to walk alone,right?

749
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:40,904
Are you Setsuko?

750
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:56,139
What's wrong?

751
01:13:58,304 --> 01:13:59,062
I understand

752
01:13:59,700 --> 01:14:01,624
I can't take her out.

753
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:12,655
When did you come back? Alone?

754
01:14:14,018 --> 01:14:15,405
Wasn't Keiko with you?

755
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,959
Let's go to my place.

756
01:14:33,753 --> 01:14:35,952
Yes, I found her near the station.

757
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:41,366
Well, it was also late,

758
01:14:42,210 --> 01:14:43,999
so She is staying at my house

759
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:46,288
Huh? What did you say?

760
01:14:48,150 --> 01:14:49,226
Is that so?

761
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,827
Well then, I'll send someone to pick her up.

762
01:14:53,123 --> 01:14:54,569
so what did she say?

763
01:14:54,860 --> 01:14:56,896
Why can't she come back by herself?

764
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:57,795
Be silent.

765
01:14:58,240 --> 01:14:59,772
No, no, oh dear

766
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:02,198
I see

767
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:04,545
Please don't worry about it anyway.

768
01:15:05,590 --> 01:15:07,897
I will definitely bring her with me.

769
01:15:41,262 --> 01:15:42,829
Did you find her?

770
01:15:50,406 --> 01:15:51,712
Please tell me.

771
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:54,770
I want to meet Setsuko

772
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:59,470
I want to meet her as my own responsibility

773
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:04,167
I will make amends her for the rest of my life.

774
01:16:04,867 --> 01:16:06,140
What do you plan to do for that ?

775
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:12,880
That won't erase your sins

776
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:16,425
So, as amends...

777
01:16:17,587 --> 01:16:18,500
So, as amends?

778
01:16:19,386 --> 01:16:21,715
Then please return Setsuko to her original state.

779
01:16:30,663 --> 01:16:32,521
the love that started from mistake

780
01:16:32,970 --> 01:16:35,193
And then, a marriage that was lazily.

781
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,525
please don't make a mockery of such a thing

782
01:16:39,258 --> 01:16:40,245
So, No matter what Setsuko say

783
01:16:40,270 --> 01:16:41,413
I oppose it

784
01:16:41,850 --> 01:16:43,676
What our purity is like

785
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,505
How could someone like you ever understand it forever?

786
01:16:46,390 --> 01:16:51,220
But if you're human, you should be able to understand. That's right, you're not even human

787
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,200
You're more barbaric, conflicted, and vile than dogs or cats

788
01:17:18,192 --> 01:17:21,192
So, what kind of person is your partner?

789
01:17:21,240 --> 01:17:23,616
What good does it do to ask that now?

790
01:17:23,661 --> 01:17:24,981
He must be a bad guy.

791
01:17:33,063 --> 01:17:36,063
Don't cry,do you think crying will solve anything?

792
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:39,240
Anyway, you should quit school right away and stay at home.

793
01:17:45,633 --> 01:17:48,633
Um, I hope it's not too presumptuous of me, but...

794
01:17:49,722 --> 01:17:52,722
Well, that would be quite sad for Setsuko

795
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,125
We are even more pitiful.

796
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,386
If this becomes known to the public,

797
01:17:57,416 --> 01:17:59,677
she won't be able to marry into a respectable family

798
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:03,480
But it's a mistake, after all

799
01:18:04,338 --> 01:18:08,290
Moreover, Setsuko-san is suffering this much as well

800
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,494
You may be judging from your business perspective,

801
01:18:13,942 --> 01:18:15,603
but I cannot do the same

802
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:17,923
Well, that phone call this morning was like that, right?

803
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,249
It's nothing

804
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:22,923
Since you say there's no need to worry, so I was not worried

805
01:18:23,167 --> 01:18:25,555
We are very embarrassed

806
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,728
It will ruin her whole life.

807
01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:30,546
It may be nothing to you,

808
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:33,570
but I'm sorry

809
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:36,439
He's someone who speaks his mind without holding back

810
01:18:36,900 --> 01:18:39,158
and I truly appreciate all that you've done for us.

811
01:18:40,070 --> 01:18:40,874
It's fine

812
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:51,630
I feel embarrassed because I thought I
was being scolded while listening to you

813
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:55,092
I am also a woman who has made mistakes

814
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:00,210
But we don't have parents either

815
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:07,013
In such times, I wished someone would scold me thoroughly,

816
01:19:12,010 --> 01:19:15,010
She is fortunate to have someone who scolds her.

817
01:19:16,167 --> 01:19:22,206
Just because a young girl tripped over a stone and fell,

818
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:26,120
does that mean she can never live as a decent woman for the rest of her life?

819
01:19:28,953 --> 01:19:33,669
Please, aunt, I ask you to apply on behalf of your daughter and teach me.

820
01:19:34,850 --> 01:19:38,861
No matter how much I suffer or how much I reflect, will I never be forgiven?

821
01:19:47,495 --> 01:19:48,484
Setsuko.

822
01:20:09,339 --> 01:20:10,043
Setsuko.

823
01:20:17,808 --> 01:20:20,511
What's done is done,
so there's no helping it.

824
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,487
I will apologize to Dad properly later.

825
01:20:28,268 --> 01:20:31,925
I...

826
01:20:33,516 --> 01:20:38,571
Her teacher and her friend came to visit

827
01:20:56,042 --> 01:20:57,227
Setsuko!

828
01:21:00,306 --> 01:21:01,454
Setsuko-san!

829
01:21:22,415 --> 01:21:23,977
that's enough

830
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:26,399
If you've cried that much, that's good

831
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:32,415
Now that we're here, you might listen to what I have to say, right?

832
01:21:33,777 --> 01:21:37,625
There are many people living in this world, and you are one of them

833
01:21:37,650 --> 01:21:42,954
I am one of them too, but how many of those people are truly without mistakes?

834
01:21:44,606 --> 01:21:47,606
You have an abundance of future ahead of you

835
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,845
In that context, as humans, we can both progress and fall into depravity

836
01:21:51,756 --> 01:21:53,140
We make progress but we also regress.

837
01:21:54,217 --> 01:21:59,102
That is why there is hope, adventure, and beauty

838
01:22:02,230 --> 01:22:05,610
But I can't take it anymore

839
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:13,790
I can't go to school where I can't join everyone

840
01:22:15,590 --> 01:22:20,368
Setsuko, why do you say that?

841
01:22:23,072 --> 01:22:24,181
My Dad....

842
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:35,001
I want to meet her father.

843
01:22:37,025 --> 01:22:38,033
Please

844
01:22:41,300 --> 01:22:44,430
Let's all ask her Dad together.

845
01:22:45,082 --> 01:22:47,641
After all, Setsuko's situation
is our collective responsibility.

846
01:22:47,677 --> 01:22:48,477
That's right.

847
01:22:51,193 --> 01:22:54,165
even I teach students
while pretending to be a teacher

848
01:22:54,599 --> 01:22:56,462
If I wash my heart, I'll find I also have a lot of mistakes

849
01:22:57,460 --> 01:23:00,460
However, I believe the issue is not about having made a mistake,

850
01:23:00,540 --> 01:23:01,907
but rather what happens after the mistake

851
01:23:02,900 --> 01:23:04,686
Although people don't make mistakes,

852
01:23:04,710 --> 01:23:07,710
Isn't the person who goes through life without ever realizing their own weaknesses and foolishness

853
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:09,563
the most unfortunate of all?

854
01:23:10,137 --> 01:23:16,136
But, you know, teacher, at that age,
having something like this

855
01:23:16,815 --> 01:23:18,879
I think that's definitely a wound.

856
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,786
But since it's a wound from her youth,

857
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:21,987
it will heal on its own if left alone

858
01:23:22,870 --> 01:23:26,456
Those people have vitality
and are inherently clean, you know

859
01:23:28,410 --> 01:23:31,410
Moreover, it's not just my father's responsibility;

860
01:23:31,890 --> 01:23:34,550
we also sincerely apologize

861
01:23:34,575 --> 01:23:35,691
Excuse me.

862
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:40,456
I came because I have a request

863
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:44,019
Please don't let Setsuko quit school

864
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:45,956
This is everyone's request

865
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,296
Just because a mistake was made

866
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,925
That's not Setsuko's intention

867
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:56,980
Moreover, the wounds that Setsuko
received are something we all vowed to heal

868
01:23:58,040 --> 01:23:58,690
Please

869
01:24:04,390 --> 01:24:08,792
Let's acknowledge this friendship of young people, shall we?

870
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:13,550
Let's heal this wound with the love of our parents and our friendship

871
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,636
Aunt, please

872
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:25,020
Dad, please say something...

873
01:24:28,899 --> 01:24:29,695
Please

874
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:35,225
What are you dawdling about?

875
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:36,706
Aren't you cooling the watermelon or something?

876
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,886
I just can't compete with young people

877
01:24:41,416 --> 01:24:43,526
Watermelon, watermelon!

878
01:25:07,144 --> 01:25:09,026
I really love Ozaki teacher.

879
01:25:09,051 --> 01:25:10,534
He never gets mad no matter what we do.

880
01:25:11,041 --> 01:25:12,542
I wish there were more teachers like him

881
01:25:13,347 --> 01:25:14,163
Hey.

882
01:25:14,188 --> 01:25:14,730
it hurts, it hurts!

883
01:25:14,762 --> 01:25:17,229
Even if you say something clever, your score isn't enough

884
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:18,838
Your score will not change this year.

885
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:38,523
THE END

Hoodlum Soldiers 6 (#6)
Heitai Yakuza Ore Ni Makasero

3
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:34,130
Anyone here?
We are here to help you

4
00:01:38,117 --> 00:01:39,547
Total loss.

5
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,899
He's alive

6
00:01:47,696 --> 00:01:50,032
Get them in to the truck, and go back

7
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,602
Come on everyone!

8
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:57,849
I'm here

9
00:01:58,615 --> 00:01:59,357
Where?

10
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,787
I'm here

11
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:02,662
Where?

12
00:02:10,787 --> 00:02:11,506
I'm here

13
00:02:12,764 --> 00:02:13,678
I'm here

14
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:32,427
Mr.private first-class

15
00:02:40,187 --> 00:02:41,179
You're die

16
00:02:44,617 --> 00:02:46,664
You're die, too early

17
00:02:53,338 --> 00:02:54,408
You're die

18
00:02:59,224 --> 00:03:00,497
Good. You made it

19
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:05,919
Everyone come!

20
00:03:12,978 --> 00:03:14,205
Don't play

21
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,517
You guys attack tanks with suicide bombs.

22
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,197
You don't have to worry about being alive

23
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:27,814
We'll train until you guys all succeed.

24
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:28,978
OK?

25
00:03:42,619 --> 00:03:43,221
Hey

26
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:44,830
Get out

27
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:53,104
Wait

28
00:03:54,407 --> 00:04:00,626
You don't know about us, but We are a unit honorably commissioned by the military.

29
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:03,665
Don't look down on me

30
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:07,673
What the hell?

31
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,501
You wanna hit me?

32
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:19,675
I'll teach you later

33
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:24,737
Notice.
Team 102  Kizaki

34
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:33,815
You have done a great job in battle.

35
00:04:34,371 --> 00:04:36,910
You have done your duty.

36
00:04:37,589 --> 00:04:42,207
You did it because you acted in solidarity.

37
00:04:42,863 --> 00:04:46,449
We send you a honorable certificate of thanks for that.

38
00:04:46,667 --> 00:04:49,652
General of the Army, Kanto,Shiro Saijo

39
00:04:51,840 --> 00:05:04,019
We received three certificates of appreciation in two months thanks to Chief of Staff Tanaka.

40
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:08,738
We really appreciate him

41
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:22,127
Please continue the suicide precept in this honor.

42
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:28,940
Tanaka tell you about next mission

43
00:05:32,575 --> 00:05:37,427
We will change our mission today

44
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:43,106
In short, We will target to South

45
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,888
We will leave from China main land

46
00:05:48,614 --> 00:05:53,692
So We will go along with this new mission

47
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,832
how is the war situation?

48
00:06:02,652 --> 00:06:03,894
I have no idea

49
00:06:04,746 --> 00:06:06,496
The situation is certainly not good

50
00:06:10,488 --> 00:06:15,402
There's no winning in this gamble

51
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:23,275
You know what?
we have bad luck

52
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,182
we have overcome many difficulties

53
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:31,760
We're causing all sorts of problems in the military

54
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:35,940
we move around like yakuza

55
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,619
we are with the traveling birds

56
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:45,558
Hey

57
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:47,668
What's that?

58
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:53,214
Today was the day of the party, and I received various gifts from Mr. Tanuma

59
00:06:53,742 --> 00:06:55,211
That's good to know

60
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,906
You told me Tanuma

61
00:06:58,211 --> 00:06:58,695
Yes

62
00:06:59,555 --> 00:07:00,289
Tanuma what?

63
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:01,555
Tanuma Seiichi

64
00:07:02,605 --> 00:07:03,550
Tanuma Seiichi?

65
00:07:04,526 --> 00:07:13,596
Converting current Teams in this region to other Teams is a very difficult task.

66
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:19,337
On top of the terrain, the passing point is likely to be MOUKATONG

67
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:22,439
MOUKATONG place is so dangerous

68
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:27,923
I think it's very dangerous to go through there

69
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,158
I'll come in

70
00:07:30,376 --> 00:07:31,267
Come in

71
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:38,368
Cho has come back

72
00:07:40,055 --> 00:07:44,063
Attention,ready?

73
00:07:46,968 --> 00:07:49,898
Once again

74
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:04,116
Thank you for your hard work.
What is the state of recent guerrilla activities?

75
00:08:04,913 --> 00:08:08,398
It's been very quiet lately as a result of the mopping up operation the other day

76
00:08:11,218 --> 00:08:13,468
How about around the MOUKATONG?

77
00:08:13,898 --> 00:08:18,343
It's quiet..well at the moment..

78
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:23,278
The guerrillas are now down to this line

79
00:08:25,231 --> 00:08:29,652
I see.
Collect accurate information there

80
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:36,324
Hi,Chou

81
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:38,644
Let's have a drink

82
00:08:39,254 --> 00:08:40,472
No thanks

83
00:08:42,402 --> 00:08:48,105
do you refuse?
This is the liquor I received from the boss

84
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:50,989
Why do you refuse?

85
00:08:51,435 --> 00:08:52,958
I can't drink

86
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:57,646
You're the boss' brother, aren't you?

87
00:08:58,536 --> 00:08:59,466
Drink it

88
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:01,255
Drink it

89
00:09:01,904 --> 00:09:03,013
I have nothing to do with this

90
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:07,419
What the hell,
I'll force you to drink

91
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:11,457
Get out

92
00:09:12,722 --> 00:09:14,504
He hates it

93
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:19,207
What the hell?
I don't know who you are

94
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,129
I'm boss's driver, Heijo Takiguchi

95
00:09:24,379 --> 00:09:25,293
You're his driver

96
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:29,660
What?
I'm not just the driver

97
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:36,214
My name is popular among Kanto Kizaki team

98
00:09:37,173 --> 00:09:39,150
I don't know about Kizaki team

99
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:43,978
I belong to various units

100
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:49,505
I have a higher status than you.

101
00:09:50,068 --> 00:09:53,701
I was boxing in Nagoya

102
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,904
i can knock you out

103
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,584
I never heard about you

104
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:04,243
Damn it, come here

105
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:08,649
You guys fight

106
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:22,494
Ok we are ready

107
00:10:25,104 --> 00:10:25,916
they start fighting

108
00:10:25,941 --> 00:10:26,979
What's wrong, Omiya?

109
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:28,823
Stop it

110
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,168
You bastard

111
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,809
Get up

112
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:25,545
You don't drink,Takeuchi?

113
00:11:25,928 --> 00:11:29,553
I prefer watch repairs to drinking alcohol

114
00:11:29,795 --> 00:11:31,193
are you a watchmaker?

115
00:11:37,084 --> 00:11:40,022
Do you always carry this repair tool with you?

116
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:44,006
I have loved repairing watches since I was a child.

117
00:11:44,918 --> 00:11:47,043
That's why I carry this tool with me

118
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:49,997
do you have a watch?

119
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:54,697
I broke my watch long ago

120
00:11:55,198 --> 00:11:58,737
Hey, Kisaburo Omiya is here?

121
00:12:01,582 --> 00:12:03,832
I'm asking you

122
00:12:05,113 --> 00:12:06,269
there is no such person

123
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:06,801
don't lie

124
00:12:08,004 --> 00:12:09,894
I know he's here

125
00:12:10,347 --> 00:12:12,012
You're too noisy

126
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:15,996
I know about him

127
00:12:19,793 --> 00:12:21,270
You're the Omiya?

128
00:12:23,004 --> 00:12:24,770
So what?

129
00:12:26,277 --> 00:12:27,410
I need to talk with you

130
00:12:29,106 --> 00:12:32,590
he is drunk.
please come back tomorrow

131
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:36,000
What the hell?

132
00:12:39,273 --> 00:12:42,523
Ok just bring it

133
00:12:46,914 --> 00:12:47,883
Omiya

134
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:53,625
I'm so busy today

135
00:13:07,344 --> 00:13:09,422
he is the Kisaburo Omiya

136
00:13:15,559 --> 00:13:18,825
I hear you exaggerated yourself greatly

137
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:21,317
So what?

138
00:13:22,339 --> 00:13:24,229
I'm Tetsu from Tokyo Asakusa

139
00:13:25,386 --> 00:13:29,237
i have pride in myself.
I was in Kanto unit for 3 years

140
00:13:30,244 --> 00:13:32,495
Don't look down on me

141
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:38,902
Why do you laugh?

142
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:43,777
I'm Sentaro from Osaka

143
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:52,020
i am a cook.
I've been waking at Kizaki unit for 5 years

144
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,802
i cook you like sashimi

145
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:02,779
I'm Tesugoro from Wakamatsu, Kyushu

146
00:14:04,012 --> 00:14:08,020
I love fights so I won't be promoted

147
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,481
I will beat you today

148
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,723
Are you Yakiza?

149
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:26,213
Do you wanna fight with me?

150
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,255
I'll fight first

151
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:29,000
Damn it

152
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:33,516
I beat you

153
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,202
You damn it

154
00:16:15,051 --> 00:16:16,363
Once again

155
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,332
I'll beat you next

156
00:16:22,973 --> 00:16:24,121
That's enough

157
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:27,768
I beat you

158
00:16:57,985 --> 00:16:58,985
You made it

159
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:02,649
Are you feeling good now?

160
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:18,509
A guerrilla force broke into MOUKATONG at 8 o'clock today.

161
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,783
We suffered two casualties, but sank the guerrilla force.

162
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,445
It seems to be different from Cho's information.

163
00:17:31,546 --> 00:17:32,578
That's bad

164
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,066
The strategy for attacking TENJING has been decided.

165
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:40,980
We will prepare together at 12:00 on the 15th.

166
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:46,293
We decided to converge from MOUKATONG to SHUUANKO as soon as possible.

167
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:48,566
4 days later, right?

168
00:17:51,836 --> 00:17:53,547
This strategy is hard

169
00:17:59,382 --> 00:18:00,515
Mr.private first class solider

170
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,187
It's very bad of you to hold back on him.

171
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,328
more alcohol please

172
00:18:18,367 --> 00:18:20,015
They need more alcohol

173
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:28,703
why do you bring each bottle of alcohol?

174
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:35,984
you are stingy.
bring a lot of alcohol at once

175
00:18:40,196 --> 00:18:44,703
Bring more food

176
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,364
i want to eat fresh food

177
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,356
i want to eat fresh food too

178
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:57,543
make fresh food for us

179
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,301
They wanna eat fresh foods

180
00:19:12,832 --> 00:19:15,645
1.2.3.4.5.6.7

181
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:16,543
one is missing

182
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:36,924
I'm full

183
00:19:40,229 --> 00:19:46,081
You treated me well.
thank you for this gift

184
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:50,524
We had a lot of fun

185
00:19:50,915 --> 00:19:53,517
I drink this liquor at night

186
00:19:54,214 --> 00:19:55,589
thank you for this gift

187
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:01,995
I'll take this too

188
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,972
That's the liquor I ordered for the boss

189
00:20:10,173 --> 00:20:12,681
You're stingy.
I'll take this

190
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:20,415
The bottle will break if dropped like this

191
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:22,403
Let's go

192
00:20:22,802 --> 00:20:24,692
Thanks for the foods

193
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,885
Thanks,Omiya

194
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:40,135
Attention!

195
00:20:46,963 --> 00:20:48,330
Line up

196
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,479
unbutton

197
00:21:21,927 --> 00:21:22,880
Sazawa sergeant

198
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:29,044
It's not good to search the soldiers without my permission.

199
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,919
i got the consent

200
00:21:32,224 --> 00:21:33,169
What?

201
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,654
my property was stolen

202
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,193
Is the culprit one of my subordinates?

203
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:46,044
Yes.
Surveillance soldiers reported to me that he escaped here.

204
00:21:50,993 --> 00:21:51,806
Are you sure?

205
00:21:52,556 --> 00:21:53,173
Yes

206
00:21:53,337 --> 00:21:54,001
Are you sure?

207
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,188
is there a culprit in this?

208
00:21:58,906 --> 00:22:00,742
why don't you reply?

209
00:22:00,953 --> 00:22:03,383
That's enough

210
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:12,164
I was going to do it secretly.
However, as you requested, I will also investigate together.

211
00:22:13,477 --> 00:22:15,899
I will report it to my boss and have him formally investigate.

212
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:16,743
That's better

213
00:22:19,223 --> 00:22:20,161
Leader

214
00:22:24,465 --> 00:22:27,051
you stole first

215
00:22:27,294 --> 00:22:28,075
What?

216
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,535
do you have any evidence?

217
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:33,301
Ask him

218
00:22:34,042 --> 00:22:37,730
he has been timid since a while ago

219
00:22:41,105 --> 00:22:43,862
What I said was right?

220
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:52,855
we are a draw

221
00:22:53,402 --> 00:22:56,128
who are you talking to?

222
00:22:57,058 --> 00:23:00,941
I don't care.
I stoked it

223
00:23:01,464 --> 00:23:02,957
What happened if I stole?

224
00:23:03,324 --> 00:23:04,472
You bastard

225
00:23:04,497 --> 00:23:07,402
Stop it.
I'll take care of this issue

226
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:19,455
Omiya.
You said you don't care who is he

227
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:22,764
don't you know military rules?

228
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:28,037
I'm teaching you how tough this unit is.

229
00:23:28,821 --> 00:23:29,258
Come

230
00:23:29,283 --> 00:23:31,766
Leader
i stole it

231
00:23:33,688 --> 00:23:37,360
you have nothing to do with this issue

232
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,274
Omiya.

233
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,415
What is the spirit of the Kizaki team?

234
00:23:45,954 --> 00:23:46,625
I'll go

235
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,438
Don't go

236
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:02,108
Seven years after I joined the military, I became the commander-in-chief.

237
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:05,851
I have confidence in my mental strength

238
00:24:06,914 --> 00:24:09,422
In the military you have to follow the rules

239
00:24:10,836 --> 00:24:16,938
But today forget the military rules and I want to fight you

240
00:24:17,796 --> 00:24:19,015
I'll teach you

241
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:21,507
Were you sure what you said?

242
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:14,363
You wanna stop?

243
00:26:19,489 --> 00:26:22,192
What are you guys doing?

244
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:32,301
why are you fighting the leader?

245
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:34,997
Stop it,boss

246
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,395
i have to settle the issue with him

247
00:26:40,907 --> 00:26:43,001
This act is against military rule

248
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:47,329
It is forbidden to fight with the leader

249
00:26:47,845 --> 00:26:51,399
I follow what you say about military rules

250
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:57,068
Please leave it to us

251
00:26:58,169 --> 00:26:59,997
are you really the leader?

252
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:02,818
it's your responsibility

253
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:07,763
I'll teach you first

254
00:27:08,912 --> 00:27:09,849
Stay

255
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:16,050
Stop it,Omiya

256
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:19,879
Stop it,Omiya

257
00:27:21,199 --> 00:27:21,926
Get your hands off

258
00:27:23,754 --> 00:27:24,504
You stupid

259
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,626
is it time to eat?

260
00:27:42,923 --> 00:27:47,111
there is no food for you today

261
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:52,987
can't you forgive him?

262
00:27:54,784 --> 00:27:55,924
Of course

263
00:27:57,355 --> 00:28:02,105
the army operates by military rules

264
00:28:03,543 --> 00:28:05,004
he broke the military rule

265
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:10,787
Moreover, he had a fight with the leader

266
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:16,678
He will be court-martialed for destroying the verification given by His Majesty the Emperor.

267
00:28:17,612 --> 00:28:20,283
please forgive him

268
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:22,471
Arita

269
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:31,549
It was 20 years ago that you and I were classmates.

270
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:41,332
You and I went our separate ways after graduating from elementary school.

271
00:28:43,207 --> 00:28:45,410
The result is my current position.

272
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:52,261
You and I are in completely different positions.

273
00:28:54,454 --> 00:28:59,118
i can't treat him special

274
00:29:01,927 --> 00:29:05,185
This is my wish as a human being

275
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:10,583
I put my personal feelings aside and am in the position I am in now.

276
00:29:15,662 --> 00:29:20,185
i have my own ideas

277
00:29:22,634 --> 00:29:28,868
You made Nomoto Kinuko unhappy with your own beliefs

278
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:38,094
You were in a relationship with her, but when she was asked to marry Ms. Nakamura's daughter, MASAE, you married her.

279
00:29:40,052 --> 00:29:42,896
Kinuko committed suicide soon after

280
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:50,655
Her suicide has nothing to do with my marriage.

281
00:29:53,553 --> 00:29:55,374
i know you want more career

282
00:29:57,428 --> 00:30:02,811
I can go public about her suicide

283
00:30:07,161 --> 00:30:08,091
do you threaten me?

284
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:10,458
No.
This is deal

285
00:30:11,536 --> 00:30:13,669
Get Omiya out from jail

286
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:19,448
I want your reply

287
00:30:21,503 --> 00:30:22,214
I decline

288
00:30:23,566 --> 00:30:25,917
I don't get involved in my private life

289
00:30:27,355 --> 00:30:28,331
Get out

290
00:30:40,624 --> 00:30:41,296
Omiya

291
00:30:43,506 --> 00:30:45,092
I'm here

292
00:30:46,397 --> 00:30:47,428
Mr.private first class solider

293
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:08,662
Thanks

294
00:31:09,709 --> 00:31:10,819
i have canned too

295
00:31:26,546 --> 00:31:27,639
Take them

296
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:39,194
What are you doing?

297
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,054
I'll come in

298
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:50,905
come in

299
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,836
I received an emergency call from MOUKATONG

300
00:32:05,146 --> 00:32:06,740
Gather all members of the team.

301
00:32:07,881 --> 00:32:09,162
And Chou too

302
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:17,962
I'm sorry to have troubled you

303
00:32:23,239 --> 00:32:28,724
Tomorrow is the day of the mission to Tianjin, but the transit point, MOUKATONG, has been attacked.

304
00:32:30,075 --> 00:32:35,435
Fortunately, security fought them off, but they could strike again.

305
00:32:36,442 --> 00:32:39,185
They could have come to investigate.

306
00:32:40,872 --> 00:32:44,552
They are waiting around the Moukatong for sure

307
00:32:46,061 --> 00:32:50,499
We have a hard time executing an operation in a short amount of time.

308
00:32:52,077 --> 00:32:57,202
We must pass through MOUKATONG withstanding attacks from the enemy.

309
00:32:57,819 --> 00:32:59,405
We'll call for reinforcements.

310
00:32:59,788 --> 00:33:00,725
How many?

311
00:33:01,046 --> 00:33:01,960
2 teams

312
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:04,819
Too less.
We need more

313
00:33:06,877 --> 00:33:10,276
This is what we can do most

314
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:14,393
Who wanna be the leader?

315
00:33:20,012 --> 00:33:21,317
Who want to be?

316
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,707
I'll be

317
00:33:27,457 --> 00:33:30,558
He was just deployed on a recent sweep.

318
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:37,613
We don't have to think about it.
He is the right man for this mission.

319
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:42,436
Can you?

320
00:33:51,353 --> 00:33:53,595
Iwagane is left here

321
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:10,920
Operation Tianjin will go ahead as scheduled at 12:00 p.m. on the 15th.

322
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:14,545
Iwagane team help us

323
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,577
You should explore the enemy's movements in advance.

324
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:19,397
I get it

325
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:28,982
You shouldn't talk to him about military secrets.

326
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,844
He was educated in Japan and swore an oath to the military.

327
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:36,149
But

328
00:34:37,563 --> 00:34:39,313
You don't trust me?

329
00:34:45,143 --> 00:34:46,979
You have to focus on your work

330
00:34:48,721 --> 00:34:50,987
I'll manage this

331
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:54,446
Yes

332
00:35:04,795 --> 00:35:06,154
Attention

333
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:12,639
Listen.
Tidy up your belongings

334
00:35:13,537 --> 00:35:15,850
You might not come back here again

335
00:35:16,707 --> 00:35:18,621
Write a letter and bring it later

336
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:22,473
All letters are censored.

337
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:23,653
OK

338
00:35:23,793 --> 00:35:24,785
Yes

339
00:35:30,991 --> 00:35:35,295
Moukatong is hard place?

340
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:39,072
That's a dangerous place

341
00:35:42,361 --> 00:35:42,970
What's wrong?

342
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:44,759
A photo

343
00:35:44,924 --> 00:35:45,728
A photo?

344
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:47,486
Your mom's?

345
00:35:48,088 --> 00:35:50,205
I guess I put it here

346
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,474
Look at there

347
00:35:54,247 --> 00:35:55,192
Here it is

348
00:35:59,747 --> 00:36:00,552
She's beautiful

349
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,558
We don't wanna die

350
00:36:03,831 --> 00:36:09,113
Omiya and Arita are so lucky

351
00:36:13,326 --> 00:36:14,373
Get out

352
00:36:19,654 --> 00:36:22,505
Get out now!

353
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:28,919
You are so unlucky

354
00:36:43,673 --> 00:36:44,611
Attention

355
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:08,239
I was told you would be willing to do this work.

356
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:14,427
I will show you the results of my training.

357
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:26,526
Wait

358
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,515
This is weapon

359
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:37,460
You dude

360
00:38:49,845 --> 00:38:52,556
You all right? Yokoi!

361
00:38:53,259 --> 00:38:54,009
Let's go

362
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:59,814
We can't.
We all die

363
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,275
We have no time.
Let's go

364
00:39:18,748 --> 00:39:23,773
Where's my mom?

365
00:39:25,844 --> 00:39:26,758
Yokoi!

366
00:39:44,308 --> 00:39:49,285
We offer my death to God.

367
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:11,362
Stay

368
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,021
We'll take a rest

369
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:29,638
You and I have been through a lot.

370
00:40:31,068 --> 00:40:33,607
we never got out of the army

371
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:38,896
we can get out of the army

372
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:41,545
It's very cloudy around here

373
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:47,811
You can't see it, but the surroundings are full of enemies

374
00:40:50,505 --> 00:40:57,997
TANUMA is using this strategy to try to kill me, who hinders his career advancement.

375
00:40:59,304 --> 00:41:00,257
Really?

376
00:41:02,937 --> 00:41:05,351
I was a fool for believing my classmate

377
00:41:06,538 --> 00:41:12,069
I'll take you and die with you.
Sorry

378
00:41:16,411 --> 00:41:20,091
this is my own business

379
00:41:21,403 --> 00:41:22,192
Sorry

380
00:41:24,489 --> 00:41:28,060
Let's get easy going

381
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:44,361
Army is coming

382
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:47,798
there is a comfort station

383
00:41:51,695 --> 00:41:52,547
Omiya

384
00:41:54,882 --> 00:41:56,726
It's me

385
00:42:16,711 --> 00:42:21,961
MOUKATONG has dangerous places, so be careful

386
00:42:23,055 --> 00:42:27,672
This place may disappear once the operation begins.

387
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:32,071
we will meet next time in heaven

388
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:34,994
Here it is

389
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:45,256
I'm glad to see you again

390
00:42:45,443 --> 00:42:50,107
We're leaving tomorrow, but it's nice to see you

391
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:52,490
We have a connection, don't we?

392
00:42:52,529 --> 00:42:56,131
I really wanted to see Otomaru

393
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,576
You’re so mean

394
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,506
But I am happy to meet you, her sister.

395
00:43:01,717 --> 00:43:02,444
Really?

396
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:05,892
I'm glad

397
00:43:06,572 --> 00:43:09,533
I've also heard a lot about you from Otomaru

398
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:11,181
I really wanted to see

399
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,475
Let's have a drink together after a long time

400
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:18,936
I'll go later

401
00:43:19,897 --> 00:43:21,499
I'll go first

402
00:43:30,654 --> 00:43:32,178
Have fun

403
00:43:35,022 --> 00:43:38,522
Please enjoy yourself

404
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:49,914
What's wrong?
You look down

405
00:43:51,073 --> 00:43:52,549
Let's drink

406
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,009
Today is the last time I see a Japanese woman

407
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:09,681
today is the last day i see the sun.
I feel sad

408
00:44:11,041 --> 00:44:18,322
Oh yeah.
All drinks and meals are now free

409
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:20,296
Please enjoy yourself

410
00:44:23,007 --> 00:44:26,663
today is the last day

411
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,013
I feel sorry for Otomaru

412
00:45:34,756 --> 00:45:39,240
we will die tomorrow so let's have fun

413
00:45:40,951 --> 00:45:42,748
Is she doing well?

414
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:44,061
Otomaru?

415
00:45:46,069 --> 00:45:50,584
I think she's enjoying her life down south.

416
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:55,096
are you suicidal?

417
00:45:57,042 --> 00:45:57,917
Yeah

418
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:02,081
But I don't know well

419
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:11,794
please don't die

420
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:18,341
I won't die

421
00:47:10,336 --> 00:47:11,149
Get off!

422
00:47:32,915 --> 00:47:36,540
Target the house ahead

423
00:47:37,258 --> 00:47:40,313
you go forward to the right

424
00:47:40,587 --> 00:47:41,915
lure the enemy

425
00:47:42,141 --> 00:47:46,290
we go to the left with three

426
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:48,559
and rush in

427
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:50,137
Move!

428
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:52,278
Let's go

429
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,179
Move forward

430
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:15,654
Move forward

431
00:48:34,131 --> 00:48:35,131
Move forward

432
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,412
Move forward

433
00:49:00,914 --> 00:49:01,680
Soyoki

434
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,024
Shit

435
00:49:09,938 --> 00:49:10,680
Omiya!

436
00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:14,409
Stop

437
00:50:22,597 --> 00:50:26,651
she is hurt

438
00:50:40,207 --> 00:50:41,582
Who's she?

439
00:50:49,325 --> 00:50:51,950
she can't speak Japanese

440
00:50:52,778 --> 00:50:54,809
it's so weird that she's alone

441
00:50:55,403 --> 00:50:58,754
she doesn't look like a spy at all

442
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:03,937
Send her to TEAM to find out

443
00:51:04,453 --> 00:51:05,351
How?

444
00:51:05,578 --> 00:51:06,461
By truck

445
00:51:06,851 --> 00:51:08,406
It's okay to have an extra person on the truck

446
00:51:09,305 --> 00:51:11,648
But Driver Sawaki got hurt

447
00:51:13,539 --> 00:51:15,117
Anyone can drive?

448
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,515
Omiya can

449
00:51:18,851 --> 00:51:19,414
Omiya?

450
00:51:35,002 --> 00:51:35,916
Mr.private first class solider

451
00:51:37,956 --> 00:51:41,854
It's nice to be with a young woman even if you don't speak the language.

452
00:51:43,987 --> 00:51:45,300
That's so you

453
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,151
I'm excited

454
00:51:49,347 --> 00:51:50,487
But she's still young

455
00:52:02,777 --> 00:52:06,519
The road is bad here

456
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:09,741
She looks strange

457
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:17,317
She does not look feeling good

458
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:20,348
Stop here

459
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:27,991
A pistol bullet is in her body

460
00:52:29,491 --> 00:52:30,983
We have to be in hurry

461
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:35,272
Wait, It takes time because the road is bad

462
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:37,573
What should we do?

463
00:52:38,495 --> 00:52:42,675
I'll give it a shot.
get the gas out

464
00:52:48,628 --> 00:52:50,222
have you ever done this?

465
00:52:50,714 --> 00:52:51,785
No

466
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:57,488
hold her hands and feet

467
00:52:59,464 --> 00:53:00,894
Lie on your back

468
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,558
Don't move

469
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:20,254
Don't move

470
00:53:22,598 --> 00:53:23,957
please do it quickly

471
00:53:24,277 --> 00:53:27,332
I don't know where the pistol bullets are

472
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:31,006
cut it properly

473
00:53:35,371 --> 00:53:37,550
Leave the rest to me

474
00:53:46,652 --> 00:53:47,558
Here it is

475
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,166
I found it

476
00:54:21,335 --> 00:54:22,694
She got better

477
00:54:25,686 --> 00:54:28,210
I won't attack her

478
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,327
Mr.private first class solider

479
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,669
i will break through here.
Protect her

480
00:55:29,871 --> 00:55:30,903
Shit

481
00:55:37,644 --> 00:55:39,097
Omiya

482
00:55:43,325 --> 00:55:44,098
Omiya

483
00:55:45,606 --> 00:55:46,856
Mr.private first class solider

484
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:34,561
That watch is useless

485
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,632
I can fix this

486
00:56:37,389 --> 00:56:41,264
If you fix these parts, this watch will definitely be fixed.

487
00:56:51,694 --> 00:56:53,062
It's too quite

488
00:57:00,611 --> 00:57:02,072
Is it radar?

489
00:57:04,205 --> 00:57:07,689
Truck found, bullet holes in tyres.

490
00:57:08,963 --> 00:57:10,744
They could have surrendered.

491
00:57:50,162 --> 00:57:51,974
Omiya

492
00:58:00,961 --> 00:58:02,765
Omiya

493
00:58:12,424 --> 00:58:14,643
Omiya

494
00:58:41,847 --> 00:58:48,308
I was tricked by you.
You use your cute face

495
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:51,012
You're laughing

496
00:58:53,067 --> 00:58:56,348
Stupid.
You don't get it

497
00:59:07,803 --> 00:59:10,420
You're Chou!

498
00:59:11,976 --> 00:59:16,859
Be quiet.
This area is an anti-Japanese zone.

499
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:22,273
She's my sister

500
00:59:23,523 --> 00:59:24,500
She?

501
00:59:31,536 --> 00:59:32,458
Are you his sister?

502
00:59:38,224 --> 00:59:40,849
I found out

503
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:44,794
You were an ambush.

504
00:59:45,974 --> 00:59:50,138
You targeted my car.

505
00:59:52,396 --> 00:59:53,607
All was you

506
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:58,526
I found out

507
01:00:01,307 --> 01:00:02,565
Are you gonna kill me?

508
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:08,411
You gonna kill Mr.private first class solider too?

509
01:00:39,558 --> 01:00:40,855
Thanks

510
01:00:43,168 --> 01:00:44,793
I'll eat

511
01:00:47,530 --> 01:00:48,796
It tastes good

512
01:00:53,835 --> 01:00:58,983
I was told they would give him a treat before sentencing him to death.

513
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:03,211
I gonna die?

514
01:01:06,571 --> 01:01:08,297
Never mind

515
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,776
You look nice

516
01:01:37,308 --> 01:01:39,284
You treated me nicely

517
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,736
You ate all as you told me

518
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,945
He is such a man

519
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:58,999
When you depart?

520
01:02:00,218 --> 01:02:04,187
1 hour later.
We will gather at Moukatong by daybreak

521
01:02:07,836 --> 01:02:11,656
Did you forget about that day?

522
01:02:13,578 --> 01:02:18,812
Our parents was killed in front of me by them

523
01:02:53,065 --> 01:02:54,643
When I gonna be killed?

524
01:02:59,936 --> 01:03:02,240
You don't get it?

525
01:03:15,493 --> 01:03:17,688
I'm freaking out

526
01:03:22,413 --> 01:03:24,327
Why I gonna be killed?

527
01:03:25,944 --> 01:03:27,217
Shall I attack you?

528
01:03:55,436 --> 01:03:56,998
I know it's bad

529
01:04:02,211 --> 01:04:04,743
I wanna meet Mr.private first-class solider

530
01:04:55,293 --> 01:04:57,574
You are here to call me

531
01:05:51,693 --> 01:05:53,591
Do whatever you want

532
01:05:58,474 --> 01:06:01,107
Can you speak Japanese?

533
01:06:02,236 --> 01:06:04,384
I can't help but tricking you

534
01:06:11,168 --> 01:06:11,832
Shuran

535
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:20,422
have a seat

536
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:24,086
You speak Japanese

537
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,301
Does it hurt?

538
01:07:02,982 --> 01:07:07,389
Please eat a lot of feasts again.
Don't go to Moukatong

539
01:07:16,069 --> 01:07:17,537
What she writes?

540
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:11,712
Mr.private first class solider!

541
01:09:19,471 --> 01:09:21,658
Mr.private first class solider!

542
01:09:21,955 --> 01:09:24,815
Mr.private first class solider!

543
01:09:25,877 --> 01:09:27,120
Mr.private first class solider!

544
01:09:35,190 --> 01:09:35,870
Omiya

545
01:09:36,674 --> 01:09:38,893
Where have you been?

546
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:42,917
I was too busy

547
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:47,104
Stay strong

548
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:02,954
Stay strong

549
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:13,081
I wanna lie down

550
01:10:26,514 --> 01:10:28,061
Give you cigaret

551
01:10:37,092 --> 01:10:37,998
What's this?

552
01:10:42,358 --> 01:10:44,162
What she writes?

553
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:55,045
Don't go to Moukatong

554
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:04,977
This is a warning of incoming attacks from the enemy

555
01:11:05,618 --> 01:11:06,352
Really?

556
01:11:09,407 --> 01:11:13,610
She wanted to return the favor to us.

557
01:11:14,196 --> 01:11:15,165
What will happen?

558
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:18,329
The army will be wiped out.

559
01:11:19,493 --> 01:11:21,470
So Are they going to die?

560
01:11:28,294 --> 01:11:32,982
I want to see how that leader dies

561
01:11:36,224 --> 01:11:37,357
Let's go

562
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,429
Everyone get together!

563
01:12:42,234 --> 01:12:44,773
Aim and shoot them

564
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:57,906
At 11:50 the enemy started attacking

565
01:12:57,931 --> 01:13:02,133
We have the upper hand in terms of military strength, and the current situation is advantageous.

566
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:05,539
the enemy can't come here yet

567
01:13:25,449 --> 01:13:27,059
Are you ok?

568
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:56,546
our helping soldiers haven't come yet?

569
01:16:06,254 --> 01:16:08,449
It's too quiet

570
01:16:13,722 --> 01:16:14,761
What's wrong

571
01:16:15,831 --> 01:16:16,894
It fixed

572
01:16:18,566 --> 01:16:20,238
I didn't think this would fixed

573
01:16:34,699 --> 01:16:35,566
Noguchi!

574
01:16:35,644 --> 01:16:36,746
Yes Sir

575
01:16:36,886 --> 01:16:41,081
At 12:20, please inform them that many of our casualties occurred.

576
01:16:41,277 --> 01:16:44,269
our helping soldiers haven't come yet

577
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:29,288
Damn it

578
01:17:36,977 --> 01:17:39,578
headquarters responded

579
01:17:39,797 --> 01:17:40,813
Will the operation change?

580
01:17:41,008 --> 01:17:44,180
Keep the status quo.

581
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:45,883
What?

582
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,578
Keep the status quo?
Is that all?

583
01:17:49,477 --> 01:17:52,695
we don't know what to do

584
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:01,920
What time is it?

585
01:18:02,857 --> 01:18:04,529
It's 12:32

586
01:18:05,482 --> 01:18:08,318
It's almost time for the operation to end

587
01:18:11,349 --> 01:18:15,154
Report the current gathering situation to OKA UNIT

588
01:18:15,451 --> 01:18:16,224
To Oka unit?

589
01:18:16,349 --> 01:18:17,131
Do it!

590
01:18:17,506 --> 01:18:18,146
Yes

591
01:18:25,032 --> 01:18:26,501
The operation was successful

592
01:18:27,063 --> 01:18:29,836
Was it a lie to make MOUKATONG your base in Tianjin?

593
01:18:30,204 --> 01:18:32,814
The policy of the Imperial General Headquarters has been the same since the beginning.

594
01:18:33,236 --> 01:18:35,321
Why was the WAKANA UNIT dispatched to MOUKATONG?

595
01:18:35,532 --> 01:18:37,087
in order to concentrate the enemy's attacks there.

596
01:18:37,571 --> 01:18:38,736
do you mind if they all die?

597
01:18:38,761 --> 01:18:39,478
Sure

598
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:46,390
I think losing 20 people is a good strategy.

599
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:50,203
let's go save them now

600
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:51,679
We can't

601
01:18:52,648 --> 01:18:54,148
I'm in charge of mission

602
01:18:54,859 --> 01:18:56,187
I order you

603
01:19:00,682 --> 01:19:03,002
Iwagami is glad that he died in battle.

604
01:19:05,151 --> 01:19:07,299
There are many bad people in that unit

605
01:19:08,932 --> 01:19:11,190
Kizaki unit is happy to clean them

606
01:19:11,893 --> 01:19:15,338
they are all my precious subordinates

607
01:19:18,061 --> 01:19:23,452
You can't get ahead unless you stop thinking

608
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:43,357
From head quoter?

609
01:19:43,716 --> 01:19:48,091
I am intercepting reports to the OKA UNIT

610
01:19:48,332 --> 01:19:49,825
From Oka unit emergency report?

611
01:19:53,208 --> 01:19:56,701
All Units are gathering in the south of KEITOKU

612
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,068
What? they moved?

613
01:20:02,136 --> 01:20:05,183
This is an order from Officer Tanuma at Headquarters to the OKA UNIT.

614
01:20:07,426 --> 01:20:10,551
Mission is completed.
Thanks to Oka unit

615
01:20:11,144 --> 01:20:13,230
I'll go to Keitokuching soon

616
01:20:18,733 --> 01:20:19,812
Leader

617
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:25,585
what will happen to us from now on

618
01:20:25,772 --> 01:20:27,155
We gonna die here

619
01:20:28,851 --> 01:20:31,999
we'll crush

620
01:20:32,726 --> 01:20:35,390
They tricked us

621
01:20:36,468 --> 01:20:39,437
Tanuma used us as a decoy.

622
01:20:41,179 --> 01:20:42,194
Damn it

623
01:20:52,141 --> 01:20:53,118
Sawaki!

624
01:21:01,884 --> 01:21:03,931
Don't get away from here

625
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:30,997
Leader!

626
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:33,903
Leader!

627
01:22:34,818 --> 01:22:36,841
You came here

628
01:22:38,294 --> 01:22:43,615
Omiya.
Tanuma was going to kill us as I thought

629
01:22:44,115 --> 01:22:45,466
Damn it

630
01:22:50,043 --> 01:22:51,894
i am a soldier

631
01:22:52,738 --> 01:22:55,902
I am prepared to die in battle

632
01:22:57,121 --> 01:23:00,738
But it's frustrating to be deceived by an ally and die

633
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:01,933
Leader!

634
01:23:05,312 --> 01:23:05,983
Get back

635
01:23:06,194 --> 01:23:08,921
You must not die until Tanuma takes responsibility.

636
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,054
Get back

637
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:13,804
You should be alive

638
01:23:25,402 --> 01:23:26,418
Damn it

639
01:23:29,363 --> 01:23:31,511
I can't forgive them

640
01:23:56,472 --> 01:23:58,316
Damn it

641
01:24:19,867 --> 01:24:28,077
You had a good result in the operation in the Moukatong's mission

642
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:39,408
I want to thank KIZAKI UNIT very much

643
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:44,279
what you have done is so amazing

644
01:25:12,193 --> 01:25:13,022
Omiya

645
01:25:35,843 --> 01:25:37,851
the officer is driving this car

646
01:25:52,188 --> 01:25:53,180
Get out

647
01:26:05,610 --> 01:26:06,313
Tanuma

648
01:26:18,362 --> 01:26:20,924
You have nothing to do with this.
Get out

649
01:26:53,323 --> 01:26:54,268
Get up

650
01:26:58,985 --> 01:27:00,399
i hate you

651
01:27:04,621 --> 01:27:07,019
Get up

652
01:27:26,557 --> 01:27:29,190
Shall I punish him more?

653
01:27:30,744 --> 01:27:32,111
That's enough

654
01:28:22,951 --> 01:28:27,466
where are we going from now on?

655
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:30,935
I'll leave it to you

656
01:28:43,578 --> 01:28:50,140
THE END

00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:16,971
Waga Shogai no Hagayakeru Hi (1948)
The Brightest Day of My Life (1948)

3
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,067
In 1945

4
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,807
August 14

5
00:01:33,961 --> 00:01:37,240
The eve of defeat in the war

6
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:46,749
Mr.Uda Mishima, here?

7
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,760
Uda? It is me.

8
00:01:59,096 --> 00:02:00,918
Do you need something?

9
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,403
I'm here to get your life.

10
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,734
My life?

11
00:02:15,744 --> 00:02:17,977
What are you going to do
with my life?

12
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,291
You are a political criminal.

13
00:02:24,718 --> 00:02:25,425
Shut up.

14
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,494
Calm down.

15
00:02:30,956 --> 00:02:36,216
The acceptance of the Ousdam Declaration
is the only way to save Japan

16
00:02:36,247 --> 00:02:39,521
You're wrong. Keeping war until the end is what will save Japan

17
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,260
You will soon understand the true.

18
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:47,126
This is when we will understand who led Japan into the tragedy of war

19
00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:49,996
You will soon understand the true.

20
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:56,705
Foolish.

21
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,268
Come on.

22
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,406
Stay away.

23
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:07,931
Father!

24
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,067
Stay strong.

25
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:25,991
Are you alright?

26
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,819
Takako.

27
00:04:31,976 --> 00:04:37,106
It's time for Japan to be reborn.

28
00:04:38,253 --> 00:04:41,914
For that, sacrifices are necessary

29
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,321
Don't be sad,

30
00:04:56,548 --> 00:04:58,246
Father! Father!

31
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:01,975
Father!

32
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:09,836
Yusuke

33
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:12,696
Ueno

34
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,600
Yay, I wonder what's going on?

35
00:07:45,858 --> 00:07:46,591
Just leave him alone.

36
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,668
He's an addict.

37
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,370
Hey,Shut up.

38
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:09,699
What's wrong, senpai?

39
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:10,644
Are you okay?

40
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:13,418
 What's going on!

41
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:18,050
Jiro

42
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:21,496
The medicine is no longer effective

43
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:23,355
Where's Dad?

44
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:24,637
Is it the teacher?

45
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:25,906
He's on the second floor

46
00:08:30,007 --> 00:08:31,308
The second floor, huh?

47
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:48,261
Yeah, that's fine.

48
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:19,595
what's that money about?

49
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,410
As promised, we'll break up

50
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:24,835
from today we're strangers

51
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,628
No, no, no, what's wrong?

52
00:09:47,402 --> 00:09:48,941
What's wrong?

53
00:09:56,092 --> 00:09:57,461
Do you want more medicine?

54
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:29,298
I have a call from Sakai-san of Showa Industries.

55
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,056
Sakai-san?

56
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,714
He will come over to the office

57
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,521
Oh really?

58
00:10:42,465 --> 00:10:43,957
What about Kei-chan?

59
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:45,855
It's none of your business., so go down

60
00:11:21,394 --> 00:11:22,887
Don't play here.

61
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,370
Hello?

62
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,705
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

63
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:55,949
Thank you for coming.

64
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:59,105
The newspapers have also produced good articles.

65
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,183
Thanks to you

66
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:03,926
Please come in.

67
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:06,385
It's just a mere million yen, after all

68
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:09,042
When I'm thanked, I actually feel embarrassed

69
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:15,019
it's more like we are managing with your money

70
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:18,566
He is my right arm

71
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:24,558
He's Colonel Moriyama, the chief public relations officer of the former Burma Dispatch 21st Army

72
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,988
This is Mr. Sakai from Showa Sangyo

73
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:27,918
I am Moriyama

74
00:12:28,043 --> 00:12:28,894
I'm Sakai.

75
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,699
The reason our newspaper is managing to get by is entirely thanks to him

76
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,886
Thank you very much in advance

77
00:12:34,918 --> 00:12:35,715
Same here.

78
00:12:37,004 --> 00:12:38,379
Moriyama.

79
00:12:40,806 --> 00:12:42,245
Call Numazaki.

80
00:12:46,605 --> 00:12:47,316
Mr.Sakai

81
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:52,103
We appreciate your financial support.

82
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,988
and I hope to repay you someday

83
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,534
Please let me know
whenever you want

84
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:01,559
Actually, I came to ask you about that today

85
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:07,683
Could you please give me something from your pocket for my sake?

86
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,995
Is this it?

87
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:14,433
There are some supplies in my factory.

88
00:13:15,496 --> 00:13:16,488
I see.

89
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:21,292
The committee heard the rumor.

90
00:13:22,144 --> 00:13:24,738
They'll uncover them tomorrow.

91
00:13:27,128 --> 00:13:28,659
Apparently someone tipped him off

92
00:13:29,173 --> 00:13:29,941
So?

93
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:35,058
with your power,
Somehow....

94
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:37,058
with the power of my mind?

95
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,214
Umazaki arrived

96
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,363
Excuse me.

97
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:55,620
I parted with Tomi.

98
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:59,990
Do you know about the black dress she wore to the hall since Friday?

99
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:04,202
She's a substitute for Tomi, so please talk to her, okay?

100
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:13,167
Leave Midori-chan alone

101
00:14:13,192 --> 00:14:14,667
She's so cheeky,

102
00:14:14,692 --> 00:14:15,824
it's fine, isn't it?

103
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,589
Hey, if you're a newcomer, I want you to at least greet us like a newcomer should

104
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,995
I'm called Midori

105
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,597
Hmph, what are you talking about?

106
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,695
I don't want to say hello

107
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,416
If you don't know my name, just look at my name tag

108
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,686
You can read, right?

109
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,796
You said something I’ve heard before

110
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,206
Try saying that again, will you?

111
00:14:37,237 --> 00:14:40,237
I’ll say it as many times as it takes

112
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:45,010
I'm different for those women who can't work unless they greet you

113
00:14:45,707 --> 00:14:48,707
Don't mess with me

114
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,012
Don’t do that.

115
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:51,316
Just let it be, let it be

116
00:14:51,512 --> 00:14:54,512
You raised your hand, didn't you?

117
00:14:54,574 --> 00:14:55,512
Hey.

118
00:14:56,317 --> 00:14:57,527
Damn it

119
00:15:18,777 --> 00:15:19,816
Stop it.

120
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:22,637
Stop it.

121
00:15:23,482 --> 00:15:25,284
Damn it, remember this next time

122
00:15:25,317 --> 00:15:26,488
what?

123
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,855
Don't make such a racket,

124
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:53,375
hey, thank you

125
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,596
Could you go out for me?

126
00:15:55,627 --> 00:15:56,308
What?

127
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,340
Just come, it doesn't matter what

128
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,870
What?

129
00:16:11,558 --> 00:16:13,387
Damn it.

130
00:16:21,426 --> 00:16:23,215
A highball, please

131
00:16:24,957 --> 00:16:27,957
You're so great.

132
00:16:28,785 --> 00:16:29,980
What do you want?

133
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,652
Master wants to take care of you.

134
00:16:35,558 --> 00:16:36,988
What do you think?

135
00:16:38,571 --> 00:16:42,784
So you're saying you're the customer-pulling, huh?

136
00:16:43,343 --> 00:16:44,925
Well, that's true.

137
00:16:45,394 --> 00:16:47,168
What happens if I say I don't want to?

138
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,556
It's not a big deal,

139
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,216
I just want you to quit here

140
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:57,248
I don't think you would say no.

141
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,916
Well then, shall I give it a try?

142
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,746
Hey, let's skip the small talk

143
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:01,831
I hate wasting time

144
00:17:07,711 --> 00:17:10,711
You just need to make up your mind

145
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:19,347
You sound just like a robot, insulting people without a care

146
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,372
That's right, I'm not human

147
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,766
Now, let's go to the master's room

148
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:28,238
It's on the second floor up those stairs

149
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,426
Like that?

150
00:17:55,454 --> 00:17:58,454
She's quite a nice woman, isn't she?

151
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:04,150
Hey Kei, I'm sorry about earlier

152
00:18:04,718 --> 00:18:07,718
Could you dance with me?

153
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:11,091
Come on, Kei,

154
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:16,552
Could you dance with me?

155
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,458
Kei.

156
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:47,094
can't I go back to how Sensei an I used to be?

157
00:18:50,614 --> 00:18:51,841
Cheer up.

158
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Even though he was so kind to me

159
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,344
Why did he suddenly become so cold?

160
00:19:03,065 --> 00:19:05,221
I guess I'll just give up

161
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,899
But it was you who put your hands together.

162
00:19:12,508 --> 00:19:14,477
I can't part.

163
00:19:15,138 --> 00:19:18,138
Why don't you ask him.

164
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,540
No way, the reason is clear

165
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:25,980
He has another woman besides you

166
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,008
What's wrong?
You hate it?

167
00:20:12,835 --> 00:20:15,835
I can do anything I set my mind to

168
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,039
That's the kind of man he is

169
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:19,828
I have a condition

170
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,664
Tell me.

171
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,548
I want to ask the president of the patriotic newspaper,

172
00:20:24,573 --> 00:20:27,573
not the master of the cabaret.

173
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:29,727
so let me hear it

174
00:20:31,532 --> 00:20:33,399
 because I like your shitty situation

175
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:36,195
I want you to use one person

176
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,086
It's piece of cake.

177
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,235
Somewhere that doesn't attract too much attention

178
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,274
It's someone with a complicated situation

179
00:20:44,741 --> 00:20:47,031
That's right

180
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,133
Alright, the deal is done

181
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:30,626
Hi.

182
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:38,821
I'm Sagawa.

183
00:21:40,031 --> 00:21:41,211
I am Hirabayashi

184
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,973
Thank you very much this time.

185
00:21:47,688 --> 00:21:49,032
Please.

186
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,602
I understand you were a prosecutor during the war.

187
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,578
The times have changed so much that it has become difficult to live from our jobs

188
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,046
But please rest assured

189
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:10,070
I will take on your heartfelt wishes

190
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:11,610
The accounting department would be good

191
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:12,796
No one will notice, and by the way,

192
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,531
Moriyama-san

193
00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:19,445
This is Hirabayashi-san

194
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:22,836
Please introduce them to the accounting department

195
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,188
Please come.

196
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:34,373
Well then, thank you for your help

197
00:22:34,469 --> 00:22:35,462
She's miss.

198
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,494
Please take a break from the transaction

199
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:48,367
That's true, but it's still not complete, is it?

200
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,120
I need to see how I will be able to work

201
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,740
I'll be right back

202
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,136
Oh, please do

203
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,524
Wait a moment,

204
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,766
big sister

205
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:12,852
What's wrong?

206
00:23:23,637 --> 00:23:26,637
Make sure to treat those guys by 10 o'clock

207
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,008
Wait a minute, let's go have lunch together

208
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:42,110
He just went now

209
00:23:42,704 --> 00:23:45,704
There's no doubt we can carry it out?

210
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,422
Don't worry,he can

211
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:51,102
Trust us.

212
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,055
Natsu, your turn.

213
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:48,147
Excuse me, where is Numazaki?

214
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:49,531
Big brother is over there

215
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,805
What's wrong?

216
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:03,657
Thank you for your hard work today.

217
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:16,251
it's a showdown!

218
00:25:17,443 --> 00:25:18,406
It's a showdown

219
00:25:36,312 --> 00:25:38,465
Hey, Dad

220
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:39,628
Please give me some alcohol

221
00:25:39,653 --> 00:25:41,016
Do you want a jin?

222
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:43,938
What's the hell?

223
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:47,271
Mr. Masasakai is waiting on the second floor,

224
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:16,750
Huh? What is that, such a dirty man

225
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:18,505
Is he planning to dance on three legs?

226
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,521
It seems the police have come.

227
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,828
Hey Jiro, come down

228
00:26:32,045 --> 00:26:34,735
Um, are you with the police?

229
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,762
No,I'm just observing

230
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,776
Oh, it was just an observation

231
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,164
Just observing, huh?

232
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:51,719
Jiro.

233
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:24,766
Is that you, umazaki?

234
00:27:26,048 --> 00:27:27,251
Who is it?

235
00:27:28,223 --> 00:27:30,829
It's me, Takakura

236
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,505
Mr. Takakura? Aren't you alone?

237
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:40,336
Hey, don't act like an idiot
doing something like that

238
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:41,102
Let's go over there

239
00:27:48,955 --> 00:27:50,672
Please, go ahead

240
00:27:56,462 --> 00:27:58,032
Please.

241
00:28:11,449 --> 00:28:14,449
It's Numazaki, long time

242
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:21,781
Takakura-kun, I'm Numazaki.

243
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,880
I knew it, you were alive after all

244
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,742
I am dressed like that.

245
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:31,485
What are you doing here?

246
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,813
If you look at this, you'll understand

247
00:28:34,456 --> 00:28:38,860
When I saw you last time,
you had confident eyes,

248
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:42,490
but did you come all this way just to say that?

249
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,376
No, it was a coincidence that I met you

250
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,953
I came to look for the gang that obstructed the investigation of the shadowy goods,

251
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:52,914
and you are what?

252
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:55,149
I am a reporter for the Democratic News.

253
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,390
Is that gang in this cabaret?

254
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:01,430
Well, they probably are

255
00:29:01,969 --> 00:29:03,500
You should be careful.

256
00:29:20,837 --> 00:29:23,915
You should be careful,saying something trivial could cost you your life

257
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,508
Leave those matters to the police

258
00:29:27,382 --> 00:29:29,375
There are men even the police can't handle

259
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:31,226
He obstructed the crackdown

260
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:34,492
It's not just a joke; you must know that man well

261
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,770
Surely, he's inside this building

262
00:30:08,524 --> 00:30:11,618
millions of Japanese people have died for war.

263
00:30:16,186 --> 00:30:20,117
My brother died.

264
00:30:21,624 --> 00:30:22,882
and some of my friends also died.

265
00:30:24,946 --> 00:30:28,376
I thought it would be okay to die too, wishing to live forever in death

266
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:32,650
But what does that matter? It was a hollow illusion

267
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,195
The war was not fought by the Japanese

268
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:42,641
It's a war of aggression carried out by military factions as part of the military business

269
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,836
What a scene it is for those who have thrown away their lives

270
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:54,141
Isn't it pitiful?

271
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:04,141
It's millions of war dead, tens of millions of war victims

272
00:31:30,524 --> 00:31:31,548
it's a dream.

273
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,391
It's a nightmare

274
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,844
it's no joke—if it's a dream, I'll wake up

275
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,820
Our lives burned away and were lost

276
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,360
Spinning like a pawn with all our strength

277
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,727
Let's spin that common one more time

278
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,492
A new Japan is beginning, moving, and advancing; you will understand its form now

279
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,055
You will also come to understand your own form accurately

280
00:32:01,356 --> 00:32:04,356
The world is moving now

281
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:08,492
You are happy.

282
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,796
You live boldly

283
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,038
With such courage.

284
00:32:17,018 --> 00:32:19,307
human history has been depicted in the midst of a raging tide,

285
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,955
and everyone has lived through it

286
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:29,095
I'm no good; I've withdrawn from life

287
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,502
I can't go back to being human

288
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,181
Please come this way

289
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:41,525
if it's dancer's room,

290
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,956
you just need to walk up these stairs

291
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,146
Could you please call her here?

292
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,116
Is it okay if we just meet for a bit?

293
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:47,182
Please go ahead.

294
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:02,541
what's wrong?

295
00:33:12,275 --> 00:33:15,115
Takao

296
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Shizuko is saying she wants you to come

297
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:22,205
She says let's have a meal together to celebrate my job offer

298
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,713
I don't wanna go.

299
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,547
come on

300
00:33:35,588 --> 00:33:37,557
Shizuko is really wanting to see you

301
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,728
Both my older sister and brother

302
00:33:40,753 --> 00:33:43,753
must be looking down on me in their hearts

303
00:33:44,869 --> 00:33:46,026
It's not true.

304
00:35:20,237 --> 00:35:21,096
Hey.

305
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:24,900
Is he Mr. Sagawa from the Aikoku newspaper, right?

306
00:35:28,397 --> 00:35:30,080
And the master here

307
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:31,924
He is your boss, huh?

308
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:35,689
Well, that's about it

309
00:35:48,373 --> 00:35:50,517
Anyway, come visit once

310
00:36:00,006 --> 00:36:01,275
What?

311
00:36:02,737 --> 00:36:03,932
I'll come again

312
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,616
Next time I show up here,

313
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,716
your boss is in trouble

314
00:36:08,048 --> 00:36:10,079
Be careful until then.

315
00:36:17,947 --> 00:36:19,017
What's wrong?

316
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,760
It's none of your business.

317
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,321
Your good person is waiting

318
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,720
You don't really belong in this apartment

319
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:09,634
How about a house with a white bathroom and a soft bed?

320
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,713
That sounds nice,

321
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,032
let's do it later

322
00:38:25,416 --> 00:38:26,775
you're being noisy

323
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:28,536
Since it's a body that was sold anyway

324
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,071
I won't run away anymore

325
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:38,173
So okay.

326
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:45,134
But tonight is no good

327
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:50,806
No? Why not?

328
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:55,447
I can't.

329
00:38:57,947 --> 00:38:59,017
Didn't you understand?

330
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,134
Wait for 2 more days,

331
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:03,591
2 days?

332
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:16,283
Then it will be the day after tomorrow

333
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,046
Let's go to Kamakura

334
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:19,384
This is the new house I bought

335
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,276
It's okay if I owe you.

336
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,673
Really? Thank you.

337
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,111
Then I'm off.

338
00:39:33,806 --> 00:39:35,650
Numazaki will take care of you

339
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,236
Numazaki?

340
00:39:38,814 --> 00:39:41,939
What job does he do?
Is he unemployed?

341
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,890
It could be.
Well,

342
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,140
Lady,please come this way.

343
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:04,376
Don't worry.

344
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,314
Well then, excuse me

345
00:41:09,705 --> 00:41:10,681
Hold on.

346
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:14,490
Are you leaving?

347
00:41:15,047 --> 00:41:16,961
Your lover will be coming soon

348
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,579
I'm just in the way

349
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,526
You're just a tout

350
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,915
At least have some tea

351
00:41:38,055 --> 00:41:39,766
Don't worry.

352
00:41:39,971 --> 00:41:41,596
Thank you for your work.

353
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,611
What kind of man is Sagawa?

354
00:42:06,141 --> 00:42:07,095
He's a great man.

355
00:42:08,369 --> 00:42:09,603
A great man?

356
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:12,646
Goodbye

357
00:42:15,486 --> 00:42:16,322
Hold on.

358
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:20,149
The entrance is over there

359
00:42:22,799 --> 00:42:23,822
You're a smart person.

360
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,370
You already know the layout of this house

361
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:31,740
If it's about this house, I know even where the trash can is

362
00:42:33,072 --> 00:42:35,322
This is my old friend's house.

363
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:39,597
Shall I play you about something?

364
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:58,993
Believe it or not, I used to
be called a lady back in the day.

365
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:02,197
There are many such women after the war.

366
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,111
Go home

367
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:10,899
I can stay for just 5 more minutes

368
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,033
I'll also talk about Sagawa for your reference

369
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:28,974
So what happens next?

370
00:43:29,795 --> 00:43:31,056
You're quite curious

371
00:43:31,875 --> 00:43:33,633
I'm interested in your story

372
00:43:33,999 --> 00:43:36,565
I put myself through shame to make a living.

373
00:43:37,027 --> 00:43:38,335
I had to provide for my siblings.

374
00:43:39,844 --> 00:43:41,735
About Kenji?

375
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,750
And I wanted revenge

376
00:43:47,727 --> 00:43:49,250
Did you make it?

377
00:43:51,406 --> 00:43:52,781
And don't make fun of me.

378
00:43:56,071 --> 00:43:59,071
I'm looking for the man who assassinated my father.

379
00:44:02,516 --> 00:44:04,133
he shone like a light in the darkness

380
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:07,500
That child had the eyes of a soldier

381
00:44:09,297 --> 00:44:11,399
On August 14th

382
00:44:12,242 --> 00:44:13,891
He killed my dad.

383
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:19,586
That house burned down, my father died,

384
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:20,096
and though it's not your line,

385
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,656
there are many hardships

386
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I have lived only with the weapon of the woman's body

387
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,867
So splendidly like this

388
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:31,732
My brother Hirabayashi is a man known as the demon prosecutor

389
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,316
He put all freedom lovers in prison during the war.

390
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:37,969
He's a terrible man

391
00:44:38,914 --> 00:44:42,758
, and now he's trembling in fear of revenge

392
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:49,250
What's wrong? Huh?

393
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,577
I've run out of my medication.

394
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:12,076
I don't know if he's a demon prosecutor or what, but

395
00:45:12,107 --> 00:45:14,249
There's no need to be that scared

396
00:45:15,148 --> 00:45:18,952
That's a very pathetic phobia.

397
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:21,928
Yet, they look down on me

398
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,746
I'm here right now

399
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,795
I was assassinated for those people

400
00:45:29,015 --> 00:45:35,093
Where is your father, who was assassinated?

401
00:45:38,008 --> 00:45:39,553
He's in here.

402
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:58,062
Mistumasa Toda.

403
00:45:58,740 --> 00:45:59,592
My father.

404
00:45:59,741 --> 00:46:00,991
I knew it.

405
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:05,608
Killing such an important person is completely wrong

406
00:46:07,091 --> 00:46:10,966
Do you remember the officer's face at that time?

407
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:15,170
I can't understand; it was pitch dark,

408
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:18,764
but his eyes were shining

409
00:46:27,736 --> 00:46:29,553
How about it? Should we go home from here?

410
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:31,500
Go home?

411
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:33,694
Just for this moment,I am a human being

412
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:38,827
Even a worthless person can, in a moment, possess the soul of a good person

413
00:46:40,315 --> 00:46:43,315
Now, let's go

414
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,616
You are one of Sagawa's underlings, right?

415
00:46:45,832 --> 00:46:50,556
That's right, I'm the man who sold my body
and gave my soul to Sagawa

416
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:54,050
And now, I'm telling you to get away from Sagawa

417
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,647
That guy is someone who will suck the bones dry

418
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,130
Originally, he was a gambler who mixed with the criminals

419
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,586
During the war, he colluded with the military,

420
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:05,835
roaming the occupied territories and doing
everything he could as a brothel manager

421
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,210
After the defeat, he hides behind the mask of democracy

422
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:12,334
He has a wife,

423
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,420
children, and a tall mansion

424
00:47:16,390 --> 00:47:18,108
He even own a villa like this

425
00:47:18,456 --> 00:47:22,025
He is a detestable person who only uses the facade of a calm life for himself

426
00:47:24,322 --> 00:47:26,053
Once I shake his hand, it's over

427
00:47:27,059 --> 00:47:31,405
This sample is me

428
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:39,660
I've become such a yakuza-like man

429
00:47:44,178 --> 00:47:46,363
Huh? Isn't that you, senpai?

430
00:47:47,085 --> 00:47:48,566
With a woman.

431
00:47:54,654 --> 00:47:57,654
Huh? What's going on here?

432
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:01,035
This is getting complicated, isn't it?

433
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:19,266
Kei.

434
00:48:26,874 --> 00:48:27,795
I wonder if everything will be okay

435
00:48:28,062 --> 00:48:29,222
For what?

436
00:48:31,571 --> 00:48:33,144
Is Sagawa coming back soon?

437
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:34,618
Don't worry about it.

438
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,117
your body is fine?

439
00:48:56,849 --> 00:48:58,882
I'll be okay

440
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:07,408
He's here.

441
00:49:30,727 --> 00:49:31,354
Jiro.

442
00:49:41,773 --> 00:49:42,648
Can't you here me?

443
00:49:45,014 --> 00:49:45,687
Jiro.

444
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:52,219
My apologies.

445
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:56,470
Ask Numazaki to come my room.

446
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,473
Do you need something?

447
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:37,954
Have a seat.

448
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:51,893
Say something.

449
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,658
What are you talking about?

450
00:50:54,682 --> 00:50:55,686
Don't play dumb!

451
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:58,783
Oh, is it about today?

452
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:03,180
Actually, I have a small request regarding that

453
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:07,380
Could you send that woman for me?

454
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:15,080
You are quite funny

455
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,273
Huh? I've fallen in love with a woman for the first time

456
00:51:20,576 --> 00:51:21,849
Please give it to me

457
00:51:23,726 --> 00:51:26,726
Why don't you go to a cup shop and cool your head?

458
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:30,159
Then let's talk again

459
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,342
I see, let's cool it down.

460
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:50,455
Damn it.

461
00:51:58,124 --> 00:52:00,757
Umazaki is no longer usable

462
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:09,440
It seems better for you not to be here, so hurry home

463
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:11,574
I'll send you off

464
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,160
I'll be waiting at the bridge, so get ready, okay?

465
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,090
Hey Aki-chan

466
00:52:35,983 --> 00:52:38,383
hey Aki-chan, are you really going to kill him?

467
00:52:38,496 --> 00:52:39,510
Because it's an order, right?

468
00:52:39,662 --> 00:52:41,184
But you, big brother....

469
00:52:41,271 --> 00:52:43,418
He has been acting like a fool lately.

470
00:52:44,597 --> 00:52:45,670
Hey Aki-chan

471
00:54:17,197 --> 00:54:18,591
Did it hurt?

472
00:54:24,346 --> 00:54:25,320
Cheer up

473
00:54:25,994 --> 00:54:27,454
Thank you.

474
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:34,333
But you're really good at this

475
00:54:35,872 --> 00:54:41,174
I was sent as a temporary nurse during the war since middle school

476
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:47,097
Hmm, there are things I learned in the war that can be useful

477
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,182
Oh, how did you get this wound?

478
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:56,650
It's nothing, just a battle scar

479
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,561
Did you get hit by a bullet?

480
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,656
A cut? Huh?

481
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:14,015
Did something happen?

482
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:18,822
Huh? I'm going home,

483
00:55:18,847 --> 00:55:20,722
you can't just stay like that,

484
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:27,095
you need to wear right?

485
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:38,534
It's dangerous, so please stay here.

486
00:55:40,903 --> 00:55:42,260
It's fine if you stay here

487
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:43,480
But I'm going home.

488
00:55:46,439 --> 00:55:47,879
Stay here for a while.

489
00:55:57,876 --> 00:56:00,696
I don't wanna be alone now

490
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:20,087
Well, I'm glad the wounds are not serious.

491
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,701
Sorry for causing you trouble

492
00:57:40,718 --> 00:57:43,509
It's nice to be doing this, isn't it?

493
00:57:44,783 --> 00:57:45,983
Yeah, it's nice

494
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,255
I feel a bit hazy

495
00:57:50,930 --> 00:57:53,131
You know, I'm just remembering something right now

496
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,876
Back when I was a child

497
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,900
There was a time when I fell asleep while playing hide and seek

498
00:58:05,889 --> 00:58:08,111
Why were you so kind to me?

499
00:58:10,472 --> 00:58:13,226
 It seems that love can inspire courage in people

500
00:58:16,729 --> 00:58:17,865
Me?

501
00:58:25,079 --> 00:58:27,370
Yeah, you're a good person

502
00:58:27,725 --> 00:58:29,085
Yeah, I'm just a worthless yakuza

503
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:32,246
Humans are not perfect

504
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:38,467
Your words are healthy and positive

505
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,110
You should get out of this society quickly, huh?

506
00:58:51,015 --> 00:58:52,601
If you help me to do that,

507
00:59:06,369 --> 00:59:07,050
You are stupid.

508
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:12,268
Was that you who shoot me behind?

509
00:59:12,402 --> 00:59:13,168
No.

510
00:59:15,392 --> 00:59:16,259
Aki.

511
00:59:16,284 --> 00:59:16,772
What?

512
00:59:18,264 --> 00:59:19,571
Aki?

513
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,460
I was just told by the boss to keep watch

514
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:26,328
Go home and say him bullshit.

515
00:59:28,211 --> 00:59:31,051
I'm going to greet him.

516
00:59:32,535 --> 00:59:34,176
so I'm just here to cool my head and say hello, okay?

517
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,629
Doesn't it hurt, Kei-chan?

518
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,870
I'm not particularly concerned

519
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:19,543
Then what is this?

520
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,400
This hole is nothing

521
01:00:24,550 --> 01:00:25,236
Don't mess with me!

522
01:00:29,124 --> 01:00:30,152
You bastard! Ugh!

523
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:45,371
new democratic media

524
01:00:47,153 --> 01:00:48,465
leave from here

525
01:00:54,451 --> 01:00:57,451
They seem to have realized something

526
01:00:58,214 --> 01:00:59,980
Just give him money

527
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:00,975
How much?

528
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:01,886
5,000 yen

529
01:01:17,159 --> 01:01:18,105
I'm Sagawa

530
01:01:18,645 --> 01:01:19,387
I am Takakura

531
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:21,285
Thank you for meeting me despite your busy schedule.

532
01:01:21,464 --> 01:01:22,667
Have a seat.

533
01:01:25,502 --> 01:01:26,699
It seems like you're having some trouble

534
01:01:26,924 --> 01:01:28,652
It's just that I can't dance

535
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:37,129
Well, let me put it simply

536
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:41,770
Are you not involved in the Showa Sangyo's confiscation of materials incident?

537
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,780
Huh? I don't really understand the meaning anymore

538
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,400
As you can see, I'm a newspaper person on the first floor, and that newspaper has a neutral nature

539
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,276
It's interesting how you expose things recklessly like that

540
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:57,300
I also take pictures of newspapers

541
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,816
Our newspaper is on the side of the people

542
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,840
We won't use gangs to interfere with investigations

543
01:02:03,070 --> 01:02:04,666
This is something you shouldn't hear

544
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:07,690
It seems that I have some connection to the Showa Sangyo incident

545
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:13,105
Mr. Sagawa, I have quite a
bit of confidence in saying this.

546
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,256
I don't know what kind of confidence you have, though

547
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,802
If I have any doubts, the police should come;

548
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:21,482
Police will tie me up, right?

549
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:23,798
You can't be tied up by the police

550
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:26,830
The only thing that can tie you up is the opportunity presented by society, like a newspaper

551
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,146
You'll regret this soon enough

552
01:02:30,170 --> 01:02:31,186
That's not how you should speak

553
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:33,596
You should say that only after you have clear evidence

554
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,365
I have about 80% of that evidence in my hands

555
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:42,470
I tracked down the truck that was carrying the gang, and there should be one of my classmates among them

556
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,487
Who are you talking about?

557
01:02:48,864 --> 01:02:49,717
Who?

558
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:52,126
I got taken for a ride at the pachinko last night

559
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,926
From behind, you know

560
01:02:53,950 --> 01:02:56,276
So what about that?

561
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,300
I feel like I have to thank you,

562
01:03:02,342 --> 01:03:05,221
so I'm currently looking for the person who made this happen

563
01:03:06,066 --> 01:03:07,049
Oh, it's you, Umazaki

564
01:03:07,303 --> 01:03:08,783
You're here.

565
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:11,906
Oh, is this your classmate?

566
01:03:11,931 --> 01:03:13,738
If you need something from me, come later.

567
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:24,850
Is this alright, President?

568
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:50,733
Hey, what's wrong?

569
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:33,053
Hey, Takakura,

570
01:04:33,331 --> 01:04:34,287
what's going on?

571
01:04:37,150 --> 01:04:38,695
Look at this leg.

572
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:40,579
It's this leg

573
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:31,617
Ah, how many people have been deprived of peace
and freedom and died miserably for his sake?

574
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:41,915
In the cruel empire of death, forced to create a rhythm in a dark trial,

575
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:49,149
everything that loves guns has been thrown into prison for him

576
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:07,110
Even the old demon Kenji, who was once wise, must be living a life now afraid of modern sounds, right?

577
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,939
It's okay to be afraid

578
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:10,751
It's okay to suffer

579
01:06:12,910 --> 01:06:14,816
While I was locked up there,

580
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:15,985
my wife died

581
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,587
She had a pitiful death

582
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,126
Thinking about that,

583
01:06:22,850 --> 01:06:24,353
I hate him

584
01:06:25,228 --> 01:06:27,001
That Hirabayashi

585
01:06:27,936 --> 01:06:30,936
He might come here

586
01:06:33,955 --> 01:06:34,580
Takako

587
01:06:38,805 --> 01:06:39,759
What should I do?

588
01:06:41,830 --> 01:06:42,642
What should I do?

589
01:06:43,196 --> 01:06:45,064
You shouldn't have to suffer so much

590
01:06:45,527 --> 01:06:47,149
You shouldn't have done such terrible things

591
01:06:47,591 --> 01:06:50,397
It's a military faction, it's a political party

592
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,566
If you have such a noble excuse,

593
01:06:53,590 --> 01:06:55,896
then there's no need to be so anxious, right?

594
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,920
Takako, please be bullied that much

595
01:06:59,630 --> 01:07:01,017
I don't mind suffering

596
01:07:02,032 --> 01:07:05,032
it's sad because she's my wife and family

597
01:07:06,120 --> 01:07:08,106
Can't you ask Mr. Sagawa for help?

598
01:07:09,261 --> 01:07:09,946
Yes, please.

599
01:07:11,892 --> 01:07:15,798
 I think I'm going to stop dating Mr. Sagawa

600
01:07:16,305 --> 01:07:17,626
Huh, why?

601
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:41,361
Welcome!

602
01:07:51,021 --> 01:07:54,021
Oh, it was Mr. Sagawa

603
01:07:54,046 --> 01:07:55,907
I thought it was someone else,

604
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,240
and I wanted to talk to you

605
01:08:03,560 --> 01:08:06,560
What do you need from me?

606
01:08:06,779 --> 01:08:07,631
Hirabayashi-san,

607
01:08:08,386 --> 01:08:11,272
Takakura-kun has challenged you to a duel! Huh?

608
01:08:12,179 --> 01:08:13,237
A duel?

609
01:08:13,783 --> 01:08:14,342
What will you do?

610
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:15,225
Will you accept it?

611
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:17,061
Absolutely not!

612
01:08:17,788 --> 01:08:18,725
I can't.

613
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:20,772
Do it.

614
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:24,545
I'm right here with you

615
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:26,406
I'm a man too

616
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:27,986
Once I take you into my custody,

617
01:08:28,010 --> 01:08:29,733
I will finally be able to support you

618
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:37,336
It's just fortunate that he made the request

619
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:38,858
This is self-defense on our part

620
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,566
This will stabilize your life

621
01:08:42,590 --> 01:08:44,061
You won't have to live in fear,

622
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,889
although Numazaki is there on the other side.

623
01:08:48,585 --> 01:08:49,889
Numazaki?

624
01:08:51,827 --> 01:08:52,991
That's not true.

625
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:56,542
you just don't know

626
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:59,780
Takakura and Numazaki are friends from school days

627
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:03,446
I heard Numazaki brought Takakura to the newspaper company

628
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:05,656
I can't believe it

629
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,235
Well, that's up to you, I suppose

630
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:19,587
However, if you find out that he is the murderer, your perception of him might change somewhat

631
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:23,806
After all, it's probably a crime you had him commit

632
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:31,556
On the night of August 14, just before the defeat, he assassinated one of the key figures

633
01:09:39,664 --> 01:09:42,664
What's wrong with wound?

634
01:10:06,227 --> 01:10:08,249
He doesn't seem to care at all about killing someone

635
01:10:09,370 --> 01:10:11,246
He will even sabotage his own side
for the sake of money

636
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:12,230
That guy is terrible.

637
01:10:14,827 --> 01:10:19,044
Takakura is trying to expose the
our actions in the newspaper,

638
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:23,821
He is provoking a duel.

639
01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:28,496
He made the request

640
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,785
Feel free to take on the challenge with confidence

641
01:10:31,659 --> 01:10:32,392
Yes.

642
01:10:36,473 --> 01:10:37,187
Takako

643
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:39,084
What should I do then?

644
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:40,409
Mr.Hirabayashi.

645
01:10:43,988 --> 01:10:47,474
Is it okay to come to Shohei Bridge at 10 o'clock?

646
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:52,625
Ah, but

647
01:10:55,769 --> 01:10:56,822
well, don't worry

648
01:10:58,180 --> 01:10:58,987
I'm right here with you

649
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:06,558
What should I do, Takako?

650
01:11:07,803 --> 01:11:08,709
Takako.

651
01:11:16,401 --> 01:11:19,024
You know, he wants to duel with you

652
01:11:19,919 --> 01:11:21,696
he used a reverse grip

653
01:11:22,687 --> 01:11:26,006
It's ridiculous that someone like me would be challenged to a duel, isn't it?

654
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:28,883
He's the man they call the demon prosecutor

655
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:29,566
If it comes down to it,

656
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,226
he will reveal his true identity from back in the day

657
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:35,250
This is a means to defeat you in self-defense

658
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,480
I don't want to misunderstand such foolishness as lineage in this day and age

659
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,370
I will justly judge in the name of society and bring a harsh lawsuit

660
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:46,276
I completely agree with

661
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:47,466
that, however...

662
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:50,456
He is currently filling in the land at 10 PM tonight

663
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:53,480
I should be waiting for you under the Kobiyashi Bridge at Sanjukenbori

664
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:55,654
Anyway, did you say it?

665
01:11:56,177 --> 01:11:56,630
Huh?

666
01:11:56,966 --> 01:12:00,345
You should clearly say that you
will file a complaint from your own mouth,

667
01:12:00,962 --> 01:12:03,645
but there is something more important than that

668
01:12:03,670 --> 01:12:06,670
I need to settle the conversation with Sagawa.

669
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:15,420
Mr. Takakura, our president, won't run away

670
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:19,156
On the contrary, he wants to have a discussion with you

671
01:12:19,180 --> 01:12:22,868
First, take care of what has come your way before that

672
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,000
It's almost 10 o'clock

673
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:29,173
What's wrong Numazaki ?

674
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,556
Moriyama, medicine?

675
01:12:37,775 --> 01:12:38,486
Medicine?

676
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,759
I don't have anything like that

677
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:46,470
Just ask that person for it

678
01:13:01,033 --> 01:13:01,900
What?

679
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:03,830
He needs something.

680
01:13:04,986 --> 01:13:05,759
Huh?

681
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:23,095
What did you come here for?

682
01:13:25,811 --> 01:13:28,811
I need the medicine again.

683
01:13:29,594 --> 01:13:30,797
You are a selfish man

684
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:36,493
I don't know

685
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,321
Go home

686
01:13:49,822 --> 01:13:50,986
the medicine is here?

687
01:13:52,222 --> 01:13:53,284
Open it! Let it out!

688
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:54,454
Let it out!

689
01:13:55,392 --> 01:13:56,119
Stop it.

690
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:08,355
Don’t mess with me.

691
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,456
For you,
How much have I spent until today?

692
01:14:19,907 --> 01:14:21,870
The medicine for you costs 1,500 yen a day.

693
01:14:23,173 --> 01:14:27,681
You were the first to make me drink it.

694
01:14:28,102 --> 01:14:31,321
I'm sorry about that. Well then, I'll stop it right now.

695
01:14:34,665 --> 01:14:37,595
Please, just one more time

696
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:42,431
If I weren't here, you wouldn't be able
to get your hands on the Medicine.

697
01:14:44,384 --> 01:14:46,236
Please.

698
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:52,384
So, are you going to listen to what I say?

699
01:14:53,650 --> 01:14:55,595
Sure.

700
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:01,634
Are you sure?

701
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:05,048
Sure.

702
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,624
Can you kill your friend, the reporter?

703
01:15:11,047 --> 01:15:12,656
Let that Hirabayashi-san have a duel.

704
01:15:14,099 --> 01:15:15,951
You don't even have to wave your hand directly

705
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:19,170
I hope they both fall at the same time

706
01:15:19,218 --> 01:15:22,218
I can't do something like that.

707
01:15:25,340 --> 01:15:28,256
The key to the medicine is here

708
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:44,999
What do you think?

709
01:15:47,461 --> 01:15:49,429
The medicine is here

710
01:15:50,818 --> 01:15:52,070
What will you do?

711
01:16:02,359 --> 01:16:05,671
Please give me my medicine quickly

712
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,528
Don't you want to feel better?

713
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,866
Your head will dry up soon, and your blood will freeze

714
01:16:14,410 --> 01:16:16,570
So, what do you think? Are you going to do it?

715
01:16:16,794 --> 01:16:19,794
I'll do anything.

716
01:16:43,569 --> 01:16:44,335
What?

717
01:16:45,047 --> 01:16:45,851
Oh you.

718
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,426
Sagawa

719
01:16:50,450 --> 01:16:52,756
Sagawa

720
01:16:53,927 --> 01:16:56,460
Just leave

721
01:16:57,430 --> 01:17:01,921
Open up!Sagawa

722
01:17:02,828 --> 01:17:04,437
Sagawa

723
01:17:14,023 --> 01:17:15,656
You are so persistent

724
01:17:19,101 --> 01:17:20,067
Why did you come?

725
01:17:23,501 --> 01:17:26,501
I came because I have a favor to ask

726
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,390
Please

727
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:30,883
Get out.

728
01:17:33,225 --> 01:17:36,225
I'm just a loser

729
01:17:36,588 --> 01:17:38,104
Let me go.

730
01:17:38,699 --> 01:17:41,699
You and I don't care anymore

731
01:17:42,340 --> 01:17:45,340
Get out.

732
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:47,836
Get out.

733
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:51,007
Just wait a minute!

734
01:18:06,736 --> 01:18:10,606
Open up!Sagawa

735
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:14,185
Damn it.

736
01:19:25,863 --> 01:19:27,407
Hirabayashi has just arrived.

737
01:19:42,590 --> 01:19:43,829
Mr. Hirabayashi

738
01:19:45,048 --> 01:19:46,977
You remember my face, don't you?

739
01:19:49,330 --> 01:19:51,188
I'm Takakura, the one was taken over by you

740
01:19:56,050 --> 01:20:01,190
I won't duel.
I will judge you in the name of the law.

741
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,128
I will definitely make you atone for your sins.

742
01:20:10,336 --> 01:20:11,925
Hirabayashi-san

743
01:20:17,674 --> 01:20:19,681
Sagawa-san!

744
01:20:20,605 --> 01:20:21,659
Sagawa-san!

745
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:26,474
Sagawa-san!! Please come!

746
01:20:57,151 --> 01:21:00,151
Taka-chan, Takako-san.

747
01:21:11,206 --> 01:21:12,495
What's wrong?

748
01:21:52,042 --> 01:21:53,027
Numazaki, stop it!

749
01:21:53,970 --> 01:21:55,026
I'm not going to duel anyone

750
01:21:55,700 --> 01:21:57,721
I told you it's just a meeting

751
01:21:57,902 --> 01:21:59,269
but you came.

752
01:22:00,206 --> 01:22:00,980
No way.

753
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,543
Damn it, stop! Did you bring me here to make me duel?

754
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:08,455
Don't say such foolish things.

755
01:22:42,486 --> 01:22:45,908
Can you support me?

756
01:22:46,392 --> 01:22:47,455
You're man.

757
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:50,930
You must settle your own past

758
01:22:51,560 --> 01:22:53,040
I made a promise with you!

759
01:22:54,130 --> 01:22:57,130
Good luck,Numazaki.

760
01:23:09,716 --> 01:23:12,716
Sagawa-san! Sagawa-san!

761
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:16,936
if we attract attention, It will be troublesome

762
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:17,774
Let's go home

763
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,876
You better keep your eyes on here.

764
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:54,900
Umazaki!

765
01:23:55,990 --> 01:23:58,990
I understand what you guys are trying to do!

766
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:04,790
What the hell are you? Are you even human?

767
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:10,095
Do you know what you're trying to do right now?

768
01:25:02,509 --> 01:25:05,104
Everything is going as Sagawa planned.

769
01:25:06,165 --> 01:25:07,993
even Kei-chan might get caught up in it

770
01:25:09,190 --> 01:25:10,743
That's the kind of guy he is

771
01:25:12,001 --> 01:25:16,571
Sagawa has been using Kei-chan with drugs all this time

772
01:25:19,423 --> 01:25:20,369
I see.

773
01:25:22,041 --> 01:25:24,017
I didn't know that.

774
01:25:46,283 --> 01:25:47,173
Takako

775
01:25:48,519 --> 01:25:50,267
Takakura was a good person

776
01:25:52,620 --> 01:25:54,306
I won't run or hide anymore.

777
01:25:56,468 --> 01:25:58,404
if there's someone to judge me, let them judge

778
01:25:59,230 --> 01:26:01,011
Even if it's just one day,

779
01:26:01,242 --> 01:26:05,592
I want to live a human life where I can laugh.

780
01:26:15,485 --> 01:26:17,631
Brother!

781
01:26:25,090 --> 01:26:27,956
Now, if you want to defeat me, go ahead and try

782
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:31,376
Even if I collapse here

783
01:26:31,910 --> 01:26:34,097
and now, there are countless eyes of the people behind me

784
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:36,630
You can't deceive those eyes.

785
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,360
You and I are no longer friends;

786
01:26:46,978 --> 01:26:47,892
I'm leaving now,

787
01:26:51,328 --> 01:26:54,328
Tomorrow's newspaper will have an article about obstruction of justice

788
01:27:12,820 --> 01:27:15,165
Numazaki is late, isn't he?

789
01:27:16,017 --> 01:27:18,259
I also kill him tonight.

790
01:27:20,829 --> 01:27:23,829
I hope he did well.

791
01:27:25,587 --> 01:27:26,416
Moriyama.

792
01:27:27,330 --> 01:27:29,212
Can you take a look?

793
01:27:30,033 --> 01:27:31,369
Let's go take a look

794
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:34,470
The rain has probably stopped.

795
01:27:58,267 --> 01:27:59,376
Numazaki

796
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,583
How about having a drink?

797
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:18,425
It went well?

798
01:28:22,710 --> 01:28:25,710
Thank you for your hard work

799
01:28:40,304 --> 01:28:43,304
I will return the cup

800
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,840
I have been in your care for a long time,

801
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:54,130
but I must now cut ties

802
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,683
I see, that's good to hear

803
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:00,520
You're going to give me medicine again, aren't you?

804
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:05,210
My body will no longer need that, I suppose

805
01:29:06,110 --> 01:29:07,165
What does that mean?

806
01:29:09,686 --> 01:29:15,203
I plan to go from here to the one place that can fix the support

807
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:20,479
I'm going to the Metropolitan Police Department.

808
01:29:22,553 --> 01:29:23,987
I will be in a jail.

809
01:29:24,611 --> 01:29:25,778
In a jail?

810
01:29:33,309 --> 01:29:42,784
That way, I will be able to crush the gang surrounding you, the society, the nest of corruption that has poisoned everything

811
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:50,309
That is the least I can do to atone for my sins

812
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:54,319
That's quite an outrageous claim you have there

813
01:30:05,031 --> 01:30:05,995
Wait!

814
01:32:23,247 --> 01:32:24,689
Can't you breath?

815
01:32:26,382 --> 01:32:27,488
Get your hands off of me!

816
01:32:31,036 --> 01:32:34,036
You should suffer more.

817
01:32:34,641 --> 01:32:37,654
You have committed a crime that has defiled society.

818
01:32:39,033 --> 01:32:40,213
Help me.

819
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:44,980
Suffer more, suffer more, it's good to suffer

820
01:33:18,794 --> 01:33:19,977
He's dead...

821
01:33:53,563 --> 01:33:54,423
I killed him...

822
01:33:58,475 --> 01:34:00,106
I killed someone again

823
01:34:23,262 --> 01:34:23,882
Takako.

824
01:34:25,890 --> 01:34:27,776
It was also me who killed your father

825
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:31,919
I did it.

826
01:34:37,633 --> 01:34:38,632
I knew it.

827
01:34:42,295 --> 01:34:42,855
You knew it?

828
01:34:56,765 --> 01:34:58,058
Turn yourself in and get out

829
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:03,080
And with your new beginning

830
01:35:12,026 --> 01:35:17,355
You killed my father.
That sin is redeemed by your current feelings.

831
01:35:19,670 --> 01:35:20,655
It will be compensated.

832
01:35:23,870 --> 01:35:26,050
I can forgive you too

833
01:35:29,673 --> 01:35:31,620
so let's go.

834
01:35:33,180 --> 01:35:35,162
Someone is coming, huh?

835
01:35:54,742 --> 01:35:55,255
Hey.

836
01:35:59,813 --> 01:36:02,813
You should turn yourself in after assessing the situation.

837
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:09,174
Well...

838
01:36:12,645 --> 01:36:13,989
Would you like to stop by my room?

839
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:43,715
Which one you want?

840
01:36:46,363 --> 01:36:47,843
Hmm? right one is Sagawa's right?

841
01:36:49,184 --> 01:36:50,124
Oh yeah.

842
01:37:03,514 --> 01:37:06,513
but it was a short relationship, wasn't it?

843
01:37:08,370 --> 01:37:11,370
Short yet infinitely long

844
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:25,443
Dawn is approaching.

845
01:37:35,550 --> 01:37:40,424
This is the sake we love for our wedding, isn't it?

846
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:51,398
Today is truly the shining day of my life.

847
01:37:55,208 --> 01:37:55,828
Kei.

848
01:38:36,417 --> 01:38:38,276
I'm glad you are alive.

849
01:38:38,761 --> 01:38:41,316
I'm so glad I got to meet you.

850
01:38:41,809 --> 01:38:43,488
Same here.

851
01:40:38,176 --> 01:40:44,996
THE END

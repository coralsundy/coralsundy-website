00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:35,341
A morning in Greater Tokyo.

3
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,566
Salaried workers from the surrounding commuter towns gather at the station.

4
00:00:43,845 --> 00:00:46,282
the population swells
to hundreds of thousands,

5
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,441
and the days continue like poking a hornet's nest

6
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,908
When the sun went down and night came,

7
00:00:56,113 --> 00:01:01,798
there were no people around and it was as quiet as a graveyard

8
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,921
Only the sound of footsteps echoing through the night sky

9
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,990
Even though it's work, patrolling late at night is extremely creepy.

10
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:21,226
It is said that dozens of people died in accidents before this building was completed.

11
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,758
and it is a mysterious thing that may be the curse of those victims..

12
00:01:26,229 --> 00:01:30,224
Strange things happen sometimes.

13
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:28,630
<i>Kaidan Otoshiana / The Ghostly Trap (1968)</i>

14
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:15,661
A ghost story?

15
00:03:15,972 --> 00:03:20,318
When Iwahashi from the Staircase Development Department finished his overtime and tried to go home,

16
00:03:20,904 --> 00:03:24,502
He said he heard the sound of typing coming from somewhere around the room where there was no one there

17
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,143
At first, no one believed it

18
00:03:28,597 --> 00:03:36,266
A security guard named Sakabe said that he had definitely heard the sound of typing coming from the documentation room and it caused quite a fuss

19
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,530
But these days, is there ghost story?

20
00:03:39,843 --> 00:03:41,943
But document section's workers are afraid of it.

21
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,570
Isn't it the ghost of Nishino-kun who disappeared?

22
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,040
Stop talking nonsense and get to work

23
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:48,168
Sorry.

24
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,047
Ghosts? stupid..

25
00:03:57,166 --> 00:04:01,730
Apparently  typists said they didn't want to sit in the seat where Nishino-kun used to sit

26
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:02,945
Why?

27
00:04:03,337 --> 00:04:06,809
When they sit there, they feel unwell.

28
00:04:07,306 --> 00:04:09,587
They get Headache or loss of appetite

29
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,781
Is it true?

30
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:14,402
They says because of Nishino-kun.

31
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:15,892
Is she really dead?

32
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,193
I don't know.

33
00:04:25,013 --> 00:04:29,235
In this era, such irrational phenomena never occur

34
00:04:31,425 --> 00:04:32,325
Chief.

35
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:36,950
I can only find this one copy of the document room,

36
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,207
but there is one more copy,

37
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:39,458
I've been looking for a long
time,

38
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,303
it's okay, I'll find it.

39
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,806
This has happened before

40
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,805
The memory of this fate must have permeated this room?

41
00:05:20,923 --> 00:05:23,037
Such a foolish thing would not work.

42
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,874
It was all done with careful calculation.

43
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,847
And already half a year has passed

44
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:40,416
At that time,  I was still president secretary.

45
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,493
This is a company that has a large presence throughout South America

46
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,047
There is a possibility that the numbers could grow

47
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:53,342
It's possible that number could be ten times higher next year

48
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:59,523
I thought Mr. Hancock would sign a contract with Jizo Industries.

49
00:05:59,868 --> 00:06:01,328
Luckily we and they can make a deal.

50
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,700
you guys gave up too quickly.

51
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,575
It is entirely my fault

52
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:10,703
This time, it was a good learning experience

53
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:15,566
Please let her wait a little while.

54
00:06:16,914 --> 00:06:18,174
Your daughter is here.

55
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,425
I'm going to ask her what she needs

56
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,871
It may not seem like a big deal.

57
00:06:28,328 --> 00:06:29,522
Actually...

58
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:34,234
Mr. Hancock's sudden change of heart was due to Kuramoto

59
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:36,242
He made it.

60
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:39,126
I'd never heard of that before.

61
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,649
I've always thought that Kuramoto was a useful man

62
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:48,525
He only went to a night school or something, but he's good at languages

63
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:50,549
And he has courage.

64
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:57,528
He managed to settle things with Mr. Hancock

65
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,100
Sorry for the wait

66
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:06,982
I think the president will be done meeting in about 20 minutes

67
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:14,552
I don't need my dad.  Will you coach me in golf again?

68
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:21,040
The president's daughter is here again.

69
00:07:21,064 --> 00:07:22,530
She's come to see Kuramoto-san?

70
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:23,960
Of course.

71
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:26,590
I wonder if they'll get married

72
00:07:26,623 --> 00:07:27,937
President likes him.

73
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,190
then he got big fish.

74
00:07:30,823 --> 00:07:32,599
He'll be executive.

75
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,101
But he has a girlfriend?

76
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:39,359
Even if he has a girlfriend, he'd dumped her and get married with President’s daughter.

77
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:41,319
No wonder.

78
00:07:53,258 --> 00:07:56,192
Wanna have a dinner tonight?

79
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,483
But if the president...

80
00:07:58,508 --> 00:08:02,647
Don't worry about dad.

81
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,197
Yes.

82
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,883
I'm serious...

83
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,314
yes!

84
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,120
Again...

85
00:08:28,946 --> 00:08:29,692
Golf?

86
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:35,238
You don't see me these days.

87
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,798
You are so cold.

88
00:08:41,573 --> 00:08:43,146
You are so stupid.

89
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:43,946
Yes.

90
00:08:44,252 --> 00:08:45,612
I was so busy

91
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,236
Won't you kiss me?

92
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:56,428
The first time you kissed me was in an elevator

93
00:08:56,988 --> 00:08:58,662
You forgot?

94
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:13,088
Wait.

95
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,262
It might seem weird

96
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,833
Is there something I want to talk to you about?

97
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,920
I can go to your room tonight

98
00:09:25,927 --> 00:09:26,754
May I?

99
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:28,261
Well...

100
00:09:29,941 --> 00:09:31,254
Are you busy?

101
00:09:31,767 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm having dinner with a client tonight, it's a bit inconvenient

102
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:57,715
Kuramoto.

103
00:09:58,255 --> 00:10:01,501
When did you start playing golf? When you were a student?

104
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:04,228
No...I'm still not good.

105
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,546
I went to night school.

106
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,190
I also attended university at night

107
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:12,972
I live a life of poverty you can't even imagine

108
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,023
How did you learn English?

109
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:23,097
I was living with a foreigner.

110
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,500
There I washed the dishes and mowed the lawn

111
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:28,992
As I take care of the dog, and I learnt English.

112
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:31,773
You're awesome.

113
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,642
You were late.

114
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,927
I had a job

115
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:58,392
You don't have to hide it

116
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,996
You met the president's daughter, right?

117
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,508
Are you jealous of me?

118
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:29,994
You're stupid.

119
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,555
I'm not interested in her.

120
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:49,272
I've got something to talk about. Seriously

121
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,864
You want me to marry?

122
00:11:52,925 --> 00:11:53,905
I know.

123
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:02,067
Women shouldn't say that.

124
00:12:04,969 --> 00:12:06,469
Why?

125
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,774
No!

126
00:12:17,505 --> 00:12:23,503
Now, if I get too tired of anything, I start to hate that woman

127
00:12:25,287 --> 00:12:30,341
You're smart so you know what I mean.

128
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,315
You

129
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:39,310
This may be a bit surprising for you, but can you marry my daughter?

130
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,464
She seems to be in love with you

131
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,868
I agree with her too

132
00:12:47,254 --> 00:12:48,241
What do you think?

133
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,925
I'm sure you'd be able to handle that wild girl.

134
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:59,484
Not at all, she's a wonderful young lady

135
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:03,065
This is a lifelong issue for you

136
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,576
so please think about it.

137
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:10,172
Of course, if you don't feel like it, you can refuse even though she's my daughter

138
00:13:10,969 --> 00:13:11,789
No way...

139
00:13:14,237 --> 00:13:15,624
Hey.

140
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:17,017
There's a news.

141
00:13:17,134 --> 00:13:17,685
What?

142
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,655
president's daughter and Mr. Kuramoto is finally becoming serious.

143
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:20,522
Really?

144
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:24,499
As expected, it's from driver information so he made it.

145
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:26,576
He is good at getting things done,

146
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,240
envy him?

147
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,280
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't jealous

148
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:32,380
The President's Daughter Anyway...

149
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,582
He'll be executive.

150
00:13:38,922 --> 00:13:39,968
I have something to tell you.

151
00:13:40,637 --> 00:13:42,044
I'm busy.

152
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:48,235
The president asked you to marry her daughter to you?

153
00:14:00,723 --> 00:14:01,683
Where are you going?

154
00:14:02,105 --> 00:14:03,566
Follow me.

155
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:18,999
What do you wanna talk?

156
00:14:20,003 --> 00:14:21,743
Don't pretend you don't know.

157
00:14:24,838 --> 00:14:26,941
Did you hear?

158
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,928
Of course you turned it down?

159
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,457
Tell me.

160
00:14:36,936 --> 00:14:38,560
I can't turn it down that easily.

161
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,397
Why?

162
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:45,562
it would be different,  it's from the president.

163
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,730
So what about me?

164
00:14:53,687 --> 00:14:57,640
Of course, I have you

165
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,280
I've reserved my reply

166
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,471
Please decline immediately,

167
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:02,870
but..

168
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:05,010
It's like an order from the president

169
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:34,205
Nishino-kun

170
00:15:35,696 --> 00:15:41,840
I slept with Mr Hancock for you.

171
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:42,823
Don't say that.

172
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:43,694
I'd say.

173
00:15:44,454 --> 00:15:47,912
I honestly didn't sleep with that foreigner.

174
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,657
It was so painful I could die

175
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,829
You said it would help you if I did that.

176
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:57,650
I'm grateful

177
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:08,775
If you thank me, so why don't you turn down the offer from the president?

178
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,555
Let's talk a little more calmly

179
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,659
The offer from the president has a certain charm that I can't give up

180
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,855
No, it's not that I'm into her daughter.

181
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:29,358
If I get married, I'll be guaranteed a position in the executive ranks.At the very least, I will be promoted to department manager.

182
00:16:33,853 --> 00:16:37,424
How wonderful is the position of department manager for an office worker?

183
00:16:38,721 --> 00:16:43,602
If I become a manager, I can do my job the way I want to

184
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,402
Well, more than anything, I want to show everyone.

185
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,180
Those who looked down on me

186
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,364
because I was poor.

187
00:16:53,943 --> 00:16:55,290
So what?

188
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,493
You're saying I have to give up?

189
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,134
Don't get me wrong.

190
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,565
At this point, let's make a cold decision between us

191
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,221
What do you mean?

192
00:17:08,508 --> 00:17:09,741
Listen.

193
00:17:12,317 --> 00:17:16,721
I don't think marriage is necessary for us

194
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,229
Marriage is a stupid, boring formality

195
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,659
You and I have a deeper relationship

196
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:32,186
You did great job.

197
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:37,235
you've done all that for me

198
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:41,348
The boss's daughter will be my wife for formality only.

199
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,727
In other words, she's a wife for special occasions

200
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,386
You're my lover

201
00:17:50,411 --> 00:17:54,566
I hope You'll understand.

202
00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:00,733
You said it nicely, but in essence you started to hate me

203
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:06,688
Not really, but I might not like you if you talk about marriage too much

204
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,910
It's ok if you don't marry me

205
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:13,209
If you hate me that much, I'll cut you off

206
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:17,329
In return, I'll make it impossible for you to marry the CEO's daughter

207
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,607
I'll tell the CEO everything that happens between us

208
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,079
That will ruin your marriage

209
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,430
No matter what happens, no matter what happens,

210
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:19,858
I'll never give you to anyone

211
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:22,091
You're mine.

212
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:30,395
Washida.

213
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:33,202
Did you make up your mind?

214
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,520
I would be happy to accept your request

215
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,681
I know she's a selfish girl, but I'll be counting on you

216
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,539
I'd appreciate your help

217
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,802
anyway...about the wedding.

218
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,161
I'd like you to come over to our place for dinner sometime.

219
00:19:49,768 --> 00:19:50,962
Thank you

220
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,717
Now, what should I do with that woman?

221
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,120
Hold on.

222
00:20:06,702 --> 00:20:07,969
What are you doing?

223
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,414
It can't be helped, since this is such an important matter

224
00:20:12,439 --> 00:20:13,419
I'm busy.

225
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,400
I have to prepare for class now

226
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,086
But

227
00:20:34,978 --> 00:20:37,032
What do you wanna talk about?

228
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,887
My thoughts on marriage are as I said the other day

229
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:48,615
I'm going to marry the president's daughter

230
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,347
But this is just a way to get ahead

231
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,210
It's a loveless marriage,

232
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:05,501
I'm pregnant with your child

233
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:08,415
Eh?

234
00:21:16,682 --> 00:21:17,668
Your baby.

235
00:21:19,202 --> 00:21:19,882
Are you sure?

236
00:21:21,522 --> 00:21:23,024
Really.

237
00:21:24,485 --> 00:21:26,188
How do you know it's my child?

238
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:28,843
It's your baby.

239
00:21:29,495 --> 00:21:31,486
Your child may be Hancock's child.

240
00:21:32,235 --> 00:21:33,889
You are a terrible person.

241
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:37,966
You think I'll give birth his baby?

242
00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:42,807
Get an abortion.

243
00:21:45,266 --> 00:21:46,441
I thought you would say that.

244
00:21:46,649 --> 00:21:47,941
I hate kids.

245
00:21:51,031 --> 00:21:54,191
Okay? I'll give you the fee.

246
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:58,659
No,
I'll give birth. It's your child.

247
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:02,172
Stop that stupid idea

248
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,529
I'm not being ridiculous anymore

249
00:22:08,483 --> 00:22:10,393
You're trying to intimidate me?

250
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:14,290
but I won't be intimidated by that

251
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,050
I want to give birth

252
00:22:23,249 --> 00:22:26,115
I think I'm getting in the way for you.

253
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,583
But I won't break up with you

254
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:34,062
I won't let you marry the CEO's daughter

255
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:37,210
I thought you were a little smarter.

256
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:41,262
How much more proud you would be if I were to succeed

257
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:44,281
You know?

258
00:22:44,306 --> 00:22:46,453
I don't care if you get promotion.

259
00:22:46,793 --> 00:22:50,947
I have already soiled my body for your promotion.

260
00:22:51,685 --> 00:22:53,758
I want that reward

261
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:56,624
I'll give it to you, what reward would you like?

262
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,251
I wanna be your wife.

263
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:03,681
To avoid being an illegitimate child.

264
00:23:04,915 --> 00:23:06,795
 you're more of a villain than I thought

265
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,889
It's you.

266
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:11,650
I'm a pure-hearted person

267
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,090
I've gone too far,

268
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:18,660
please give me the reward.

269
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:21,723
I just can't do that.

270
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,057
This is a once in a lifetime opportunity

271
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:30,378
I'll never take this chance, no matter what you say

272
00:23:31,603 --> 00:23:37,927
I'm going to be your enemy.

273
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:38,890
Hold on.

274
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,233
Where are you going?

275
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,517
I'm going to president office.

276
00:23:51,969 --> 00:23:53,089
Are you sure?

277
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,962
of course.

278
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,014
If you talk , I can kill you.

279
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,500
Go ahead.

280
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,746
Kill me.

281
00:24:18,628 --> 00:24:20,228
Come on.

282
00:24:21,398 --> 00:24:23,018
Don't be loud.

283
00:24:23,924 --> 00:24:27,537
You'll think about it again?
Which one?

284
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,065
I lost.

285
00:24:32,999 --> 00:24:34,894
You marry me?

286
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:38,369
It can't be helped.

287
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:42,552
Oh CEO.

288
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,723
Turn down the offer.

289
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,160
Hold on

290
00:24:52,274 --> 00:24:53,962
Don't rush.

291
00:24:54,821 --> 00:24:56,121
Are you confused?

292
00:24:56,854 --> 00:24:57,734
No

293
00:24:57,988 --> 00:24:59,915
I'm in a hurry.

294
00:25:00,215 --> 00:25:01,228
Let's go.

295
00:25:08,813 --> 00:25:10,375
She have a concussion

296
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,330
Well, it's nothing serious, but I'll take an x-ray later just to be sure

297
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,515
She's three months pregnant

298
00:25:30,163 --> 00:25:33,590
It hurts.

299
00:25:34,518 --> 00:25:36,225
It hurts.

300
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:53,548
Before the marriage, I'm going to promote you to a higher position

301
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,900
That would be better for public opinion too, so .

302
00:25:57,781 --> 00:25:58,768
thank you

303
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,730
But I still feel like the business manager is too much.

304
00:26:02,988 --> 00:26:04,415
I don't think so.

305
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,426
You are now a person who does belong to the basic department head

306
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,630
I knew you were useful, so I kept you with me.

307
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:18,970
In that case, people who are much more senior than me would be under me

308
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:20,829
I don't think you need to worry about that

309
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:21,909
Yeah.

310
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:26,170
You'll never be the next president if you're that weak-willed

311
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:28,364
Don't talk too much.

312
00:26:30,175 --> 00:26:32,864
About your honeymoon,

313
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:38,343
How about you travel around the world for two months?

314
00:26:38,534 --> 00:26:41,188
That's awesome.

315
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,025
It would be a good opportunity to learn from this
experience by visiting our branches.

316
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:50,571
Please have this.

317
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,085
Thank you very much.

318
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:54,971
Thanks for today?

319
00:26:55,344 --> 00:26:56,851
Did you like the steak?

320
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,315
I made it.

321
00:26:58,635 --> 00:26:59,896
It was very good.

322
00:27:00,903 --> 00:27:02,875
I wish you had told me that sooner

323
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:05,797
You.

324
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:08,869
Please take it easy today.

325
00:27:15,627 --> 00:27:16,820
Mom,please.

326
00:27:35,824 --> 00:27:36,938
Renoir?

327
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,046
It's real,

328
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,466
it's amazing

329
00:27:41,627 --> 00:27:43,993
Our grandfather get it.

330
00:27:46,185 --> 00:27:47,761
It must have been quite expensive.

331
00:27:49,025 --> 00:27:51,862
Did he say 30 million?

332
00:27:52,862 --> 00:27:55,146
Are you interested in this kind of thing?

333
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,875
I was born poor, so I have a weakness for this kind of luxurious atmosphere

334
00:28:04,026 --> 00:28:05,145
Kuramoto-san

335
00:28:08,129 --> 00:28:14,080
Dad said he wants us to live in a house near them when we get married

336
00:28:14,586 --> 00:28:15,341
Of course.

337
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:18,382
it's okay if Mom and dad is near you?

338
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:21,084
I don't care.

339
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:23,421
That was a good thing

340
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:28,955
I know I'm happy, and my dreams come true

341
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,789
I am happy too.

342
00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:36,388
I can't believe I got to marry someone as wonderful as you

343
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:44,486
You've been my idol since the first time I met you

344
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,993
Me too.

345
00:29:02,017 --> 00:29:05,894
Money and CEO's chairs.

346
00:29:06,858 --> 00:29:10,272
Everything are going to be mine.

347
00:29:35,615 --> 00:29:36,508
How do you feel?

348
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:38,848
I have a headache

349
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:42,164
what the X-ray results are?

350
00:29:46,495 --> 00:29:47,875
I don't know

351
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,053
I never thought it would turn out like this

352
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,207
Sorry about that

353
00:29:57,223 --> 00:30:00,812
You probably wish I was dead

354
00:30:01,231 --> 00:30:02,271
Don't say bullshit.

355
00:30:03,582 --> 00:30:05,770
If I die with my neck bones

356
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:07,680
I wonder what's been
going on with you by now.

357
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:08,717
Don't even joke around

358
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:15,103
But I won't be killed

359
00:30:15,984 --> 00:30:17,124
Are you insane?

360
00:30:18,309 --> 00:30:20,575
Maybe you hit your head and went a little crazy?

361
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:23,950
I'll revenge you.

362
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,380
I'm gonna ruin your marriage

363
00:30:28,089 --> 00:30:29,812
Don't get so excited.

364
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:33,127
My head hurts

365
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,353
Don't get too excited,

366
00:30:43,212 --> 00:30:47,598
just calm down and listen to what I have to say

367
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,334
I've made up my mind

368
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,060
I'll turn down the offer.

369
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:07,430
I was about to make a mistake because of materialistic calculations,

370
00:31:09,143 --> 00:31:11,783
I was an egoist just like you said.

371
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:17,822
Please forgive me for everything that's happened up until now

372
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:25,259
Why are you still angry?

373
00:31:30,194 --> 00:31:32,170
First,

374
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,917
I can't believe it unless you turn down the marriage proposal to the president first

375
00:31:39,513 --> 00:31:41,870
I'll definitely go to work tomorrow and refuse

376
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,647
Not tomorrow, say no now

377
00:31:45,747 --> 00:31:46,487
Now?

378
00:31:47,944 --> 00:31:49,481
You can just call now

379
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:53,203
It's late.

380
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:57,177
Look, you can't refuse after all.

381
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:06,268
If you don't say it in front
of me, I can't trust you.

382
00:32:13,406 --> 00:32:15,312
Then I'll call him.

383
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,810
Is President Yukawa there?

384
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:48,165
This is my secretary, Kuramoto

385
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,780
Yes, I'm very sorry to bother you so late at night,

386
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,070
but I would like to speak to the president
for a moment

387
00:32:56,028 --> 00:32:56,742
Sorry.

388
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,527
Are you the president?

389
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,802
Were you sleeping?

390
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,630
I'm very sorry for the late.

391
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:18,597
but it's actually about your daughter

392
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:24,290
However, I think that this is too much for me to accept,

393
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:26,408
so I will have to decline

394
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,597
No, please don't feel bad about it

395
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:43,397
I will express my feelings again tomorrow, but please forgive me

396
00:33:55,465 --> 00:33:56,305
Hung up.

397
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:01,960
How about this?

398
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,436
Ah, I'm exhausted.

399
00:34:07,066 --> 00:34:10,847
He was in a bad mood and maybe He'll fire me.

400
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:14,714
Sorry.

401
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:31,583
I need to be done about this woman quickly

402
00:34:41,568 --> 00:34:45,332
If things continue like this, I'll miss out on this great fortune

403
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,537
Now, where should it be?

404
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,640
Are you working overtime today?

405
00:34:55,887 --> 00:34:56,540
Yes.

406
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,588
I have to put together the rundown for the
president's speech by tomorrow

407
00:35:00,762 --> 00:35:02,275
You need my help?

408
00:35:03,193 --> 00:35:05,006
See you.

409
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:48,960
Yes, How about the underground water tank?

410
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:06,712
Hold on

411
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:12,887
What would happen if the dead body started to decay in an aquarium?

412
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,463
This water is drained to the water boilers and hand washing facilities in various areas.

413
00:38:30,863 --> 00:38:36,129
The water is dirty and may clog the water taps

414
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:42,118
Hair may get caught in the pump valve

415
00:38:46,518 --> 00:38:48,688
Yes, here is better.

416
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,035
If you put it here, it's complete. There's absolutely no risk of it being discovered

417
00:40:55,062 --> 00:40:57,424
Hello, it's me.

418
00:40:58,251 --> 00:41:00,066
Did you took off your bandages.?

419
00:41:02,466 --> 00:41:03,533
That's good

420
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,211
Is there anything wrong with the baby in your belly?

421
00:41:07,171 --> 00:41:08,604
Don't worry.

422
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,235
People say that the president is in bad mood.

423
00:41:12,735 --> 00:41:13,795
I turned down the marriage proposal

424
00:41:13,968 --> 00:41:16,365
I was happy.

425
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:20,724
I also felt refreshed.

426
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,961
I'm happy

427
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:28,508
I want to talk to you about various things about marriage.

428
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,034
about marriage?

429
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,786
I thought we had to do it soon for the sake of getting married for the baby.

430
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:39,638
Well then, let's talk about that.
Come here?

431
00:41:39,857 --> 00:41:42,556
Where should I go?

432
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,293
I'm still at work and working overtime.

433
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:46,758
Is there someone there?

434
00:41:46,794 --> 00:41:48,030
I'm alone

435
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:49,806
I get it.

436
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,556
Please come to this secretary's office at 8:30

437
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:59,500
Don't let the guys from work see you

438
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:02,546
It's okay, I'll sneak out.

439
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:14,278
Yes.

440
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:17,882
Sorry I was late

441
00:42:18,094 --> 00:42:19,315
see anyone?

442
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,780
I didn't meet anyone.

443
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:30,272
Let's go.

444
00:43:12,198 --> 00:43:13,218
I'm happy.

445
00:43:19,545 --> 00:43:20,812
It's going up.

446
00:47:03,104 --> 00:47:06,140
53 minutes

447
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:18,932
Today, I would like to thank Haruo Kuramoto and President Yukawa for their marriage

448
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:22,430
Congratulations to Midori on their marriage

449
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:29,430
I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations
to everyone who attended the reception

450
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:37,160
I finally gave up hope in the face of poverty and humiliation

451
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:45,893
In those dark and miserable childhoods I dreamed of the glory of today

452
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,166
Our round-the-world trip finally reaches its final destination, Hawaii

453
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:08,770
Right now, Midori is truly filled with happiness and it was a dreamlike honeymoon

454
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:12,660
They'll be arriving in Tokyo on the 12th.

455
00:48:18,072 --> 00:48:20,759
Welcome back.

456
00:48:21,338 --> 00:48:23,385
I'm back.

457
00:48:26,794 --> 00:48:29,237
Is everything ok?

458
00:48:29,766 --> 00:48:30,446
Nothing?

459
00:48:30,911 --> 00:48:31,858
Were there any personnel moves?

460
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:32,953
No.

461
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:36,737
Documentation specialist Nishino Etsuko is missing.

462
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,390
Did she get married or something?

463
00:48:42,329 --> 00:48:44,122
No, she just disappeared

464
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:46,633
Missing?

465
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,963
She hit her head on the fire shutter

466
00:48:49,370 --> 00:48:50,798
She hasn't been seen since

467
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:56,698
We contacted her parents and tried to find her, but they don't know where she is

468
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,355
Did you report it to police?

469
00:49:01,636 --> 00:49:02,954
Apparently they filed a search request with the police,

470
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,544
but the police don't seem to know anything about it

471
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,445
I was surprised. There are surprisingly many people who have disappeared

472
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:13,998
Apparently there were 90,000 people there last year

473
00:49:15,801 --> 00:49:18,468
There're a lot.

474
00:49:24,274 --> 00:49:26,605
Etsuko Nishino's brother is here.

475
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,600
He would like to meet you.

476
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:30,195
Me?

477
00:49:32,188 --> 00:49:36,600
Get through in the reception room.

478
00:49:38,755 --> 00:49:40,548
Sorry to have kept you wait.

479
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:47,481
I'm Kuramoto.

480
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:50,829
This is Etsuko's brother, Nishino Fumio

481
00:49:50,869 --> 00:49:52,009
Thanks.

482
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,097
You live in Saitama?

483
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:00,023
What can I do for you?

484
00:50:00,156 --> 00:50:02,436
About Etsuko.

485
00:50:02,919 --> 00:50:04,759
I came here often but

486
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,369
At that time, you were traveling.

487
00:50:07,454 --> 00:50:10,107
I was in abroad.

488
00:50:10,750 --> 00:50:15,072
Actually, I was surprised to learn about Nishino-kun's thoughts for the first time today

489
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,882
Still no clues?

490
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,649
So I was waiting for you to come back

491
00:50:22,996 --> 00:50:26,732
Why is that?

492
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:30,413
There are people who say that

493
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:33,946
my sister had a very close relationship with you.

494
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,150
So I thought maybe I could find out something

495
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:38,271
if I asked you.

496
00:50:40,015 --> 00:50:41,916
We dated at work

497
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:45,187
We had no private matters.

498
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:48,872
I heard from doctor.

499
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:51,540
My sister was apparently pregnant

500
00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:53,408
Is that true?

501
00:50:53,803 --> 00:50:57,120
she was in a deep relationship with someone

502
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:00,847
I'm looking for him.

503
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:04,072
Yes,

504
00:51:05,407 --> 00:51:08,013
Do you have any idea what it is?

505
00:51:08,841 --> 00:51:11,355
I don’t have any. I’m in a completely different department.

506
00:51:15,671 --> 00:51:16,168
I see.

507
00:51:16,786 --> 00:51:19,758
I'm sorry I couldn't be of any help at all

508
00:51:22,309 --> 00:51:25,019
I'm currently at work

509
00:51:25,196 --> 00:51:27,532
so sorry for bothering you

510
00:51:31,183 --> 00:51:34,103
If there is anything I can
contact you right away

511
00:51:34,128 --> 00:51:35,866
please

512
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,679
What happened ?

513
00:52:05,077 --> 00:52:06,057
did you do this?

514
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:08,084
What are you mad about?

515
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:11,241
Don't leave your stockings on

516
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:15,133
Let me sleep a bit more, my head hurts

517
00:52:16,282 --> 00:52:17,368
Your head?

518
00:52:18,781 --> 00:52:20,807
I couldn't sleep

519
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,000
I had a scary dream

520
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:30,366
What kind of dream was it ?

521
00:52:32,673 --> 00:52:35,343
the automatic elevator stopped midway.

522
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,915
It's pitch black and there's a power outage

523
00:52:41,130 --> 00:52:44,792
No matter how much I call for help, no one comes

524
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:53,130
That's ridiculous.
Wake up.

525
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:00,030
It's really stupid that ghosts appear in a refreshing company?

526
00:53:02,538 --> 00:53:05,125
Don't say stupid?
Who said that?

527
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:09,994
The driver, Ikegami, told my dad the other day,

528
00:53:11,176 --> 00:53:14,769
but you're not stupid enough to believe a story like that

529
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,720
I'll be working a little late today

530
00:53:31,603 --> 00:53:32,965
Are you still here?

531
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:36,155
Thank you for your hard work

532
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,470
Is it true that there are ghosts in companies?

533
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:01,790
I have headache....

534
00:55:16,636 --> 00:55:20,702
It was 8:53.

535
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:28,653
What does this mean?

536
00:55:29,835 --> 00:55:33,914
The sound of type writer. A voice that sounds like it's coming from the bottom.

537
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:42,060
Surely a ghost is here?
It must be my imagination

538
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:43,849
It must be my imagination

539
00:55:50,026 --> 00:55:54,299
Hello?  Oh....Nishino-san?

540
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,619
I'd like to meet you for a moment, but I won't bother you

541
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:04,005
Yes, I'll be waiting for you on the north side of the building

542
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:17,940
I'm sorry for calling you
out of your busy schedule,

543
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:21,926
Were you able to find something?

544
00:56:22,526 --> 00:56:28,269
I still don't know where my sister is, but I've been trying to look into her social circle

545
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:32,803
Finally, I found one person

546
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:45,046
The man is a buyer named Hancock

547
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,309
A letter arrived at my sister's apartment from this man

548
00:56:50,290 --> 00:56:53,448
From the contents, there was a relation between them.

549
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,646
He's in Brazil right now

550
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:03,420
In that case, he is someone who does business with us

551
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,426
I didn't know.

552
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,070
I don't know what happened.

553
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:16,395
According to the man's letter,

554
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,089
he will be coming to Japan soon,

555
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,742
so I'd like to meet him when he arrives and ask him about it

556
00:57:27,165 --> 00:57:33,862
But I feel like my sister is no longer in this world

557
00:57:35,491 --> 00:57:36,191
What do you mean?

558
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:38,424
She might be dead

559
00:57:39,821 --> 00:57:41,401
Why do you think so?

560
00:57:42,411 --> 00:57:45,270
I just somehow feel that way

561
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:49,080
suicide?

562
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:52,725
No.
It seems like she was murdered.

563
00:57:56,957 --> 00:57:59,223
That wouldn't happen.

564
00:57:59,248 --> 00:58:05,792
I'm sorry to bother you when you're busy

565
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:20,659
This is going to be bad for me.

566
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,546
Hello?

567
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:54,867
Hello?

568
00:59:34,953 --> 00:59:37,466
Something has happen, please come

569
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:43,756
Someone is here.

570
00:59:45,479 --> 00:59:46,375
No one is here.

571
00:59:52,587 --> 00:59:53,980
I saw someone here.

572
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:56,825
but it's just your imagination, manager

573
00:59:59,946 --> 01:00:02,761
I saw her with my own eyes,

574
01:00:03,756 --> 01:00:04,755
it's strange

575
01:00:18,068 --> 01:00:21,325
I don't understand. I just can't understand

576
01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:26,655
Was it just my imagination after all?

577
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:08,976
What's wrong?

578
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,953
Don't turn on the light.

579
01:01:33,196 --> 01:01:34,222
What's wrong?

580
01:01:39,669 --> 01:01:41,582
What's wrong?

581
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,775
Keep hugging me.

582
01:01:44,729 --> 01:01:45,516
More.

583
01:01:49,970 --> 01:01:51,470
More.

584
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:17,293
You are violent.

585
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:18,927
Why you hate me?

586
01:02:19,537 --> 01:02:20,435
Sorry

587
01:02:26,706 --> 01:02:28,186
Something is wrong, tonight.

588
01:02:49,452 --> 01:02:52,185
Get out.

589
01:02:54,794 --> 01:02:56,055
What's wrong?

590
01:02:56,709 --> 01:02:57,709


591
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:22,341
I'm neurotic.
That's a hallucination

592
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:25,749
It seems that once something dies, it cannot be held back

593
01:03:27,770 --> 01:03:29,563
Let's check the body again

594
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,662
The body should still be at the bottom of the pipe shaft

595
01:04:28,772 --> 01:04:30,266
Is he okay?

596
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,376
He had two stitches in his forehead, but there is nothing wrong with the bones

597
01:04:33,401 --> 01:04:34,673
so there is no need to worry

598
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,747
Considering it was a traffic accident, it wasn't serious.

599
01:04:39,573 --> 01:04:40,600
It was good.

600
01:04:46,973 --> 01:04:48,426
Is he painful?

601
01:04:48,781 --> 01:04:50,685
I was given a sedative,

602
01:04:50,950 --> 01:04:53,064
but I guess it's still painful from the wound

603
01:04:54,217 --> 01:04:54,991
You.

604
01:05:01,922 --> 01:05:04,708
He's having trouble with something.

605
01:05:05,794 --> 01:05:07,268
Is he okay?

606
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:11,576
In the case of an accident, the shock remains, so that's probably why.

607
01:05:51,297 --> 01:05:51,799
what's wrong?

608
01:05:53,183 --> 01:05:54,711
The door is shaking.

609
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:56,610
Where have you been?

610
01:05:57,103 --> 01:05:58,497
I was talking to my dad.

611
01:05:59,302 --> 01:06:00,337
Take a bath.

612
01:06:03,465 --> 01:06:04,385
My dad said that

613
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,424
He said he'll buy us a new car

614
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,131
Well, I'll go in first

615
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,347
What happened?

616
01:06:41,307 --> 01:06:42,507
there's a power outage

617
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,234
There is a candle, please light it

618
01:07:11,248 --> 01:07:13,275
Thank you.

619
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:56,888
It's an illusion. Illusion and illusion.

620
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,414
What's wrong?

621
01:08:43,336 --> 01:08:49,252
Is she still alive or am I hallucinating?

622
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:54,932
There's no other way than to see it with your own eyes

623
01:08:55,630 --> 01:08:59,487
First I need to check the pipe shaft where I throwed her body.

624
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,570
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Manager

625
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:15,692
I just came to pick up some documents.

626
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:17,275
Oh, I see

627
01:09:19,953 --> 01:09:21,430
Are you okay now?

628
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:23,570
Yes, I'll be going to work from tomorrow.

629
01:09:23,595 --> 01:09:25,150
Thank you for your hard work

630
01:10:00,865 --> 01:10:06,625
Thank you for your hard work. Mr. Kuramoto from Nippon Trading has just arrived

631
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:07,866
He came here to pick up a document.

632
01:10:07,966 --> 01:10:08,599
OK.

633
01:10:11,163 --> 01:10:14,833
there's no one else left

634
01:10:17,390 --> 01:10:18,770
Thank you for your hard work

635
01:10:22,473 --> 01:10:23,885
Are you going home?

636
01:10:26,620 --> 01:10:28,533
Good night.

637
01:12:05,224 --> 01:12:08,124
Her body isn't here....

638
01:12:09,707 --> 01:12:11,741
It seems she has come back to life after all

639
01:13:59,911 --> 01:14:00,806
Good morning

640
01:14:01,185 --> 01:14:04,195
Good morning, I forgot something to tell you.

641
01:14:04,220 --> 01:14:05,430
When the manager was on leave,

642
01:14:05,430 --> 01:14:07,835
Nishino Etsuko called me

643
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:10,975
When was that?

644
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,561
It was there last Saturday,

645
01:14:12,951 --> 01:14:14,998
I asked her where she was but she just hung up without saying anything.

646
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:19,490
But now it's clear that

647
01:14:19,490 --> 01:14:20,887
she's alive

648
01:14:23,990 --> 01:14:26,989
Good morning

649
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:31,136
Someone act like that.

650
01:14:32,382 --> 01:14:35,104
I'm absolutely certain that Nishino Etsuko is dead

651
01:14:37,370 --> 01:14:38,563
Who do it?

652
01:14:44,009 --> 01:14:44,435
Yes,

653
01:14:44,824 --> 01:14:46,349
the president is calling you.

654
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:47,193
Okay,

655
01:15:06,096 --> 01:15:07,664
power outage?

656
01:15:19,371 --> 01:15:20,445
Etsuko?

657
01:15:24,416 --> 01:15:25,323
Etsuko?

658
01:15:28,058 --> 01:15:29,504
You!

659
01:15:35,396 --> 01:15:38,562
You killed my sister, right?

660
01:17:46,213 --> 01:17:50,286
THE END

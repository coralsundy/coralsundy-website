<i>Kyohansha / Accomplice (1958)</i>

3
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:22,457
Please come visit our store

4
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:26,067
Enjoy your shopping.

5
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:54,869
I am very honored to be invited to Hikosuke Uchibori and Masae Yoshizawa-san's engagement party today.

6
00:01:55,715 --> 00:02:08,605
This is because we, who are involved in business, believe that the path that Mr Uchibori took to achieve his current success is a living example,

7
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:18,191
and at the same time, it will surely provide many hints for the rapid development of our company in the future.

8
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:26,918
Speaking of Maruboriya, there is no one in Kyushu who doesn't know about the name.

9
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:40,730
It's all thanks to Uchibori-san that we've made such progress in the last five years.

10
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,800
He got a wonderful wife, Masae

11
00:02:47,825 --> 00:02:52,256
and this has enabled us to establish a complete system both domestically and internationally

12
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:58,958
I think they're going to have a wonderful life.

13
00:03:00,657 --> 00:03:14,988
I would like to ask you to please attend their wedding ceremony on October 3rd.

14
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:34,074
I need to add some words on the congratulatory speech by the Chairman
of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry as my congratulations

15
00:03:35,245 --> 00:03:45,626
I believe it is no exaggeration to say that Uchibori Hikosuke
is the truest example of Successful people.

16
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,170
This is because Uchibori started out as a salesman

17
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,410
and has made full use of his experience
to achieve the success he has today

18
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:03,496
I have great admiration for his noble character

19
00:04:07,129 --> 00:04:09,769
This concludes my congratulatory speech

20
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:44,052
Well, that's the case this month.

21
00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:45,779
Thank you for everything

22
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:51,590
Next month I will bring new cups and other things

23
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,301
Thank you again one more time

24
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,355
Well, bring me new one.

25
00:04:57,634 --> 00:05:00,996
We want a new design.

26
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,387
I contacted the head office immediately

27
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,871
Thank you very much for your hard work.

28
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,691
Thank you very much.

29
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,090
You'll be staying here tonight?

30
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,325
Yes.

31
00:05:12,715 --> 00:05:15,168
But Uchibori-san's business is also good

32
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,470
You travel around the country and see a lot of things.

33
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:19,396
No way.

34
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,676
The schedule is so packed that there is no time to look around

35
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,590
Well, it's hard to be tied down like me at home.

36
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,715
I'm not tied you up

37
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,262
Please make yourself at home.

38
00:05:57,142 --> 00:05:58,423
Machida-san

39
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,348
Good evening

40
00:06:03,403 --> 00:06:04,825
We met again.

41
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:07,762
how are your business?

42
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:13,605
I forget about business when I am in the bath.

43
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:19,465
I've worked as a salesman for eight years after the war.
I think this is based on that experience.

44
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,582
I still don't feel like you.

45
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,074
Uchibori-kun seems to be too sensitive

46
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,855
I think you'll understand my feelings soon.

47
00:06:32,355 --> 00:06:36,613
I only think about what is in front of me

48
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:41,496
When I go to work, I forget about my wife and stuff.

49
00:06:43,683 --> 00:06:45,972
My wife is very strong.

50
00:06:50,465 --> 00:06:55,184
Mr. Machida, do you have any cheap ways to make money?

51
00:07:00,293 --> 00:07:00,981
I know.

52
00:07:32,395 --> 00:07:33,746
Futakumi Shikaku...

53
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,590
It's almost time for the bus. Shall we get ready?

54
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,488
Open it

55
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:11,371
Look.
The number is not set.

56
00:09:19,043 --> 00:09:19,903
There're a lot.

57
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,111
Get your act together, it's 5 million

58
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:34,580
This is your share.

59
00:09:38,986 --> 00:09:42,377
What's wrong with you? If you keep hesitating, dawn will break

60
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,236
Listen, as long as I'm with you today, I'll forget your name and face

61
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,658
We have never met or seen each other

62
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,073
Ok?

63
00:09:57,134 --> 00:10:01,400
You are very careful, so I don't think you will spend that money right away.

64
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,486
Let's do it steadily for about three years.

65
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:07,385
I'm fine.

66
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,198
Hang in there.

67
00:10:46,133 --> 00:10:48,076
What are you thinking about?

68
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:53,033
You have such a serious look on your face.
It must be about work

69
00:10:54,734 --> 00:10:55,921
It's about you.

70
00:10:58,312 --> 00:10:59,632
Is it true?

71
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:02,015
I think I feel strange.

72
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,312
someone like you become my wife.

73
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:06,070
It's started again

74
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:09,778
I didn't think you'd accept it so readily

75
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,305
This is all thanks to you and
 and I'm really happy about his personality

76
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,132
I'm not joking.

77
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,925
Of all the men who have appeared before me up until now,

78
00:11:22,956 --> 00:11:26,089
you are the one I feel the most politically and trustworthy about

79
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:30,049
I'm trustworthy?

80
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:33,763
Because I have made up my mind.

81
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,710
Your love for me is only from the heart...

82
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,246
No, Don't accepted like that.

83
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,685
because I love you so much, so I accepted your propose.

84
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,283
But a woman can't decide to get married just because she loves a man

85
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,971
I guess it's only good if we can respect him.

86
00:11:55,077 --> 00:11:56,717
Oh my god.

87
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,435
I'm quick to take things the wrong way

88
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:08,431
There is one thing I really want to ask you before we get married.

89
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,256
I wonder if I'll ask you about it.

90
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:24,425
I believe that there should never be any secrets between people who are getting married

91
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,606
Well, every person has secrets, big or small

92
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,300
So if there's something you haven't told me before

93
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,401
I want you to tell me

94
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,865
now that it is my right to hear you as your wife.

95
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,590
I have no secrets to tell you

96
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,548
You don't have it either?

97
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,445
I don't have it either.

98
00:12:57,346 --> 00:13:00,432
Sorry to ask you.

99
00:13:00,745 --> 00:13:03,349
I know that sounds rude, but I guess I'm being a bit too cautious

100
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:13,780
It's a beautiful shell. What does it say?

101
00:13:13,826 --> 00:13:14,780
Akoya shell.

102
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,360
I grew up on Mountain, so I don't know anything about the sea

103
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,888
What A bouncy girl.

104
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,953
Men's are boring in many ways.

105
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,117
That's not true,

106
00:13:42,616 --> 00:13:44,167
Uchibori-san

107
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,568
What's been in my head for the past few years

108
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,153
I just wanted to make Masae happy somehow

109
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,010
Dad still has work to do, right?

110
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,874
No, I've been letting Shizo take over.

111
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:04,880
no, that's not good.

112
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,187
I guess you have  to take care of it after all

113
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:09,615
I know.

114
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:12,685
Go ahead.
I'll take care of the rest.

115
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,980
She's like that.

116
00:14:16,266 --> 00:14:18,695
So please take your time

117
00:14:26,554 --> 00:14:29,417
He is a craftsman.
But he is a very gentle person.

118
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,453
Can I take off your clothes?

119
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,042
My dad likes you.

120
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:42,795
Because all kinds of people come and say
all sorts of things about you

121
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:43,605
About what?

122
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,140
No matter what, I don't even ask

123
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,569
The world is so noisy,

124
00:14:47,499 --> 00:14:50,099
But I didn't say anything.

125
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,904
I like you currently.

126
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:03,481
Hikosuke-san, you don't feel suffocated when you're in this house

127
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,728
No, it's not like I'm suffocated or anything like that

128
00:15:08,328 --> 00:15:09,955
That's good.

129
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:20,270
Sometimes I think about tradition or the times here

130
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:23,860
I always feel like that thing is rotting from the top of my head

131
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,420
I envy of you,Hikosuke.

132
00:15:26,894 --> 00:15:29,007
You are traveling around.

133
00:15:32,404 --> 00:15:35,074
Masae.
I'm leaving.

134
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:36,160
What happened ?

135
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,355
I completely forgot that I had an appointment.

136
00:15:39,223 --> 00:15:41,031
Say hello to your dad.

137
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:59,163
I have one thing to tell you.

138
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,302
All I had in my mind for the past few years

139
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:08,112
I just wanted to make Masae happy somehow

140
00:16:10,295 --> 00:16:12,289
I envy of you,Hikosuke.

141
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,946
You are so nice.

142
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:33,070
What's wrong with you? If you keep hesitating, dawn will break

143
00:16:34,417 --> 00:16:36,137
Hey, move!

144
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:47,076
The moment I step out of Takasaki, I completely forget about my house and my wife

145
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:51,971
My wife is very strong.

146
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,739
Takasaki.

147
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:12,031
Takasaki.

148
00:18:06,053 --> 00:18:07,213
What's wrong?

149
00:18:07,965 --> 00:18:09,796
what time are you leaving tomorrow?

150
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,377
I will be at the store at 8 as usual,

151
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,552
What else you need?

152
00:18:14,759 --> 00:18:15,339
Nothing.

153
00:18:38,787 --> 00:18:41,462
I will be taking a day off from work

154
00:19:17,004 --> 00:19:21,701
Hello, is this the telephone exchange? I'd like to know the telephone number of Takasaki

155
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:26,257
It's in the Kanto region, and my boss's name is Takasaki

156
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:35,550
My name is Takeshi Machida.
Please.

157
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:38,932
Is Machida Succeeding or Falling?

158
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:47,627
If he was on the down low and found out about
my wealth and wisdom, he would threaten me

159
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:14,957
Hello, hello. Did you find it?

160
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:22,729
Hello, no. 6714 in Takasaki. What kind of business does he do?

161
00:20:24,074 --> 00:20:25,074
Writer?

162
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,187
thank you very much

163
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:39,077
Work hard for about three years

164
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:04,055
Hello, are you an oriental advertisement?

165
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:09,837
I would like to advertise in a local newspaper in the Takasaki area of Gunma Prefecture

166
00:21:14,796 --> 00:21:17,608
Is Ryoichi-san going out fishing again?

167
00:21:17,923 --> 00:21:19,069
Here's a letter for you.

168
00:21:19,435 --> 00:21:20,470
Leave that there

169
00:21:20,982 --> 00:21:23,715
If you work too hard, you'll ruin your health

170
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,042
You went to Tokyo to find a nice husband.

171
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:30,430
I thought I was relieved.

172
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,206
He lost his job and you are unlucky.

173
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:39,353
Yoshie want her dress painted

174
00:21:39,378 --> 00:21:43,371
Take it for me mom,
I'll have time after this.

175
00:21:45,617 --> 00:21:47,762
I'm disgusted with you.

176
00:21:47,787 --> 00:21:54,418
You don't sew Hiroshi's shirts but you really take care of him.

177
00:21:55,269 --> 00:21:57,576
That's right,
I'm like you when you were young

178
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,886
Don't say that.

179
00:22:03,469 --> 00:22:04,603
Etsuko

180
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,904
I hear Hiroshi get back to the Takasaki area.

181
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,307
So you're coming back here?

182
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:16,283
The wish he had asked has finally come true

183
00:22:19,263 --> 00:22:21,915
So I'll talk to Takeoka and find a place to stay

184
00:22:24,263 --> 00:22:27,295
Because Hiroshi is back

185
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,330
You don't have to leave here all of a sudden

186
00:22:30,754 --> 00:22:32,614
Take this

187
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:36,130
This is a letter from someone in Fukuoka

188
00:22:36,155 --> 00:22:36,927
Fukuoka?

189
00:22:38,728 --> 00:22:40,808
I finally got the reply!

190
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:42,977
Did you win a lottery?

191
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,923
The reply has come, it has come, it has come

192
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,909
It comes from Fukuoka,

193
00:22:50,946 --> 00:22:52,360
From Fukuoka?

194
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:55,417
Are you sure?

195
00:22:57,913 --> 00:22:59,814
Your card reading was right.

196
00:23:00,293 --> 00:23:02,805
I'm excited.

197
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:12,578
Dear sir/Madam

198
00:23:18,962 --> 00:23:21,064
Specifically, twice a month

199
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:23,321
People in Takasaki City

200
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:28,145
Please inform us of their business status and
any special personal events that may occur

201
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,985
The details of the transaction must never be known to the other party

202
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,771
A monthly salary of 20,000 yen is paid

203
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,491
Oh yeah!

204
00:23:37,711 --> 00:23:39,317
We made it!

205
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:40,863
I'm so glad.

206
00:23:41,398 --> 00:23:43,726
I'll be new's reporter.

207
00:23:43,751 --> 00:23:45,404
You have to make new business card.

208
00:23:45,612 --> 00:23:48,059
It's been 2 years since I lost my job.

209
00:23:48,983 --> 00:23:51,205
Now I can live like a human for the first time in a long time

210
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,097
Don't cry.

211
00:23:56,433 --> 00:23:58,275
but humans is awful

212
00:23:58,373 --> 00:24:00,575
I can't believe they inform me by a piece of paper like this

213
00:24:00,650 --> 00:24:05,420
For us, it was more beneficial than the protection of Kannon

214
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:06,649
Yeah.

215
00:24:08,228 --> 00:24:09,991
Let's work hard!

216
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,437
4340 yen 67151280 yen

217
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,210
4320 yen for 3000 tons at 85 yen?

218
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,123
that's 189,837 yen

219
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,357
How about you Omori-san?

220
00:24:59,537 --> 00:25:01,445
it's just 300 yen

221
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,908
Did you drink too much last night again?

222
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,452
Next, Aomori Prefecture.
Please calculate.

223
00:25:09,816 --> 00:25:11,968
6458 yen 2700

224
00:25:15,585 --> 00:25:16,385
Hello?

225
00:25:17,427 --> 00:25:18,694
Call my husband.

226
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:21,073
From your wife.

227
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,000
It's me.

228
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:30,417
please come back

229
00:25:30,697 --> 00:25:31,583
I can't.

230
00:25:32,039 --> 00:25:34,883
I am so busy with the accounting today.

231
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:36,446
What are you talking about?

232
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,937
This is important.

233
00:25:39,365 --> 00:25:42,838
I know everything about you.

234
00:25:44,397 --> 00:25:45,730
Come home.

235
00:25:45,761 --> 00:25:47,202
I asked about you from her right now

236
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,653
Anyway, I'll do that when I get home

237
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,857
His wife is very strong.

238
00:25:54,838 --> 00:25:56,005
You too?

239
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,771
That's true.
She's from Akagi,Joshu.

240
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,530
I am from Joshu too.

241
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,202
You have to look for a quiet man like me

242
00:26:03,608 --> 00:26:05,168
You're mean.

243
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,910
Where were we..

244
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:26,250
Please calculate in Aomori Prefecture, the fee is 7,620 yen

245
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:29,850
2500 tons is 5 yen, and 7565 yen.

246
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,096
It is 133,500 yen

247
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,198
Next, let's go to Akita.

248
00:26:36,603 --> 00:26:39,393
3120 yen and 5250 yen

249
00:27:05,772 --> 00:27:06,839
President

250
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,925
Oh Taguchi,
Are you back in store?

251
00:27:11,107 --> 00:27:12,166
I was wondering if you could ride me on.

252
00:27:12,233 --> 00:27:12,947
Go ahead.

253
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,618
The president,everything goes fine.

254
00:27:23,751 --> 00:27:25,445
Kokura branch is set.

255
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,810
Let's do it in Kumamoto City next

256
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,360
Can we leave it to me?

257
00:27:30,385 --> 00:27:31,803
You're proud of your work.

258
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:35,545
My brother is working there.

259
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:39,399
Let's buy that place and think about it

260
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:47,280
All right.

261
00:27:51,357 --> 00:27:52,364
Welcome back.

262
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,117
I have some research to do, so don't let anyone through

263
00:28:21,955 --> 00:28:24,911
The business has been normal since then,

264
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,331
There's no rumor about women...

265
00:28:29,003 --> 00:28:32,856
This has already been the fourth time,

266
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:36,248
so I would like to take a look at your face.

267
00:28:36,945 --> 00:28:41,658
In this regard, I would like to visit and greet you

268
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,842
and ask for your kind instructions

269
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,480
That's stupid.

270
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,346
Come in.

271
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:55,423
Hello?

272
00:28:58,052 --> 00:28:58,541
Welcome.

273
00:28:59,419 --> 00:29:00,259
Sorry for bothering you

274
00:29:00,284 --> 00:29:01,090
I just finished,

275
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:02,374
what do you think about going out with me tonight?

276
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:02,882
What is it?

277
00:29:03,423 --> 00:29:05,003
Guess what.

278
00:29:05,028 --> 00:29:06,063
I have no idea.

279
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:06,886
OK?

280
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:07,986
Ok.

281
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:11,008
It's a shame my schedule is busy today

282
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:15,557
Regarding the Kokura branch,  having dinner with bank officials

283
00:29:16,074 --> 00:29:17,700
Ok I'll forget

284
00:29:18,187 --> 00:29:21,300
I will invite you to Nishitetsu part for making up.

285
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,337
In appreciation of your continued, President Maruboriya

286
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,998
Don't make fun of me.

287
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:28,152
Business men must be always humble.

288
00:29:28,177 --> 00:29:33,758
I'm trying my best to be a good wife to you

289
00:29:35,488 --> 00:29:37,742
I'm sorry you got angry.

290
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,697
Don't get me wrong.

291
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,711
so I...

292
00:29:45,482 --> 00:29:46,456
don't tell me.

293
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,978
I already know.

294
00:29:52,213 --> 00:29:56,270
There's nothing wrong with what you did past

295
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,056
Masae.

296
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:03,153
Tonight, as the president of Maruboriya, treat everyone with respect

297
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,745
Well then I'm looking forward to Nishitetsu party.

298
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,423
Goodbye.

299
00:31:08,774 --> 00:31:11,525
If that happens, I won't stay in Takasaki.

300
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,001
It's the same here,

301
00:31:13,646 --> 00:31:15,983
but what you stay?

302
00:31:19,293 --> 00:31:20,760
What are you doing?

303
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,010
What's wrong?

304
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,815
I'll make sure he doesn't say anything.

305
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:50,095
It's Really Possible?

306
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,823
I do what I decide to do.

307
00:31:54,547 --> 00:31:57,401
Shut up!
Get out.

308
00:32:01,864 --> 00:32:04,554
What's the hell?

309
00:32:04,579 --> 00:32:08,429
Are they here to watch movie?

310
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,285
Welcome.

311
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,715
Is that a lie?

312
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,985
Instead, we'll have to start over again

313
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,360
Let's go anywhere far away

314
00:32:36,909 --> 00:32:40,161
Hokkaido or Kyushu that no one knows

315
00:32:40,761 --> 00:32:41,841
Kyushu?

316
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:49,718
That's right, let's go to Chiba where there are nice places

317
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,180
I have some good friends too

318
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:56,801
You also have a client there who is a
big fan of yours and cares about you

319
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,339
Sorry for the wait

320
00:33:06,131 --> 00:33:08,502
We had agreed to communicate twice a month,

321
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:11,840
but the other day I went to the movies with my wife

322
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,659
By chance, I met one of my clients, Tsuyoshi
Machida, and witnessed a glimpse of his private life

323
00:33:19,027 --> 00:33:22,642
Up until now, I have reported that he have had no relationships with women

324
00:33:23,257 --> 00:33:26,795
We sincerely apologize for the mistake and insufficient investigation

325
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,793
He has special dealings with a worker,

326
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,080
which caused a dispute between wife

327
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,946
and the business naturally became poor

328
00:33:36,842 --> 00:33:38,372
Recently, the business has not been doing well,

329
00:33:39,259 --> 00:33:44,969
and it has become clear that a considerable number of loan slips are in circulation

330
00:33:46,576 --> 00:33:53,076
This sentence predicts that the worst
will come to his business and family.

331
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,584
There are plenty of excuses here too

332
00:34:06,658 --> 00:34:07,391
I don't wanna see your face.

333
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,491
Same here

334
00:34:34,244 --> 00:34:36,072
Now the whole house is yours.

335
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,344
We have some debts, but you'll bear with them

336
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:43,327
Just 5,6 years ago, you left house and made me trouble

337
00:34:44,521 --> 00:34:45,614
and I thought I had finally settled down

338
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:46,981
You got caught by a stupid woman.

339
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:49,687
Don't do same thing happened to both of us

340
00:34:51,524 --> 00:34:53,490
this is a registry office, this is a divorce notice

341
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,252
Please give it your stamp and deliver it to me

342
00:34:55,698 --> 00:34:57,078
Are you leaving now?

343
00:34:57,538 --> 00:34:59,098
You don't wanna see my face,right?

344
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,243
so once I've decided on where I live , please deliver my personal belongings

345
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,201
See you.

346
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:26,874
Even fish make fun of me.

347
00:35:27,332 --> 00:35:29,883
It can't be helped.
You were unlucky

348
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:33,911
Being Salary men is miserable...

349
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,766
Even so, it was too bad that I got fired after 2 months.

350
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:42,518
That's fine, We will wait for good fortune once again

351
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:47,907
But now Hiroshi is transferring.

352
00:35:49,296 --> 00:35:51,555
It can't be helped.

353
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:54,579
Should I go back to Tokyo and try again with working?

354
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,437
No, no, it's not that bad.

355
00:36:00,552 --> 00:36:03,305
Why not?
It doesn't mean I work as thief.

356
00:36:04,242 --> 00:36:05,542
I don't like it.

357
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:10,956
I want to make any money

358
00:36:11,609 --> 00:36:13,030
I'm tired of being poor.

359
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,363
What?

360
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:26,211
I can't hear.

361
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,506
I guess it's some kind of severance pay?

362
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,613
but I worked only two months.

363
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:42,827
I've been waiting for a long time.

364
00:36:43,365 --> 00:36:44,255
Sorry.

365
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,210
How much?

366
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:54,236
30,000 yen

367
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:55,596
30,000 yen?

368
00:37:05,805 --> 00:37:10,365
I have notified you that I will be terminating my investigation about Takasaki ,

369
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:14,462
but I would like to start a new investigation from a different angle

370
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,254
Therefore, I would like to continue to push back on the deadline

371
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:26,247
The goal of the investigation is to investigate the state of affairs of Mr Takeshi Machida as an example of the failure of a small business due to family disputes

372
00:37:26,752 --> 00:37:31,165
I thought you have to investigate about Machida who has been to Chiba.

373
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:37,265
For now, I will send you the enclosed 30,000 yen as an extra expense

374
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:42,740
Machida-san is the man who met at movie theater someday, right?

375
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,754
That's right

376
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,768
I know that he left their home
and went to Chiba with that woman

377
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,562
I don't think it's right to pry into someone else's private life

378
00:37:53,706 --> 00:37:56,947
That's what I get paid for at work, so I can't help it

379
00:38:09,772 --> 00:38:10,659
He's not here.

380
00:38:12,541 --> 00:38:13,339
Oh my god.

381
00:38:13,364 --> 00:38:14,181
What's wrong?

382
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,944
Look at this.

383
00:38:19,439 --> 00:38:21,432
What a nice Kokura branch.

384
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:23,542
Next, we will open a branch in Kumamoto.

385
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:25,402
You will open a branch in Kumamoto too?

386
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,325
Maruboriya will be  top department stores in  Kyushu.

387
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:32,510
If you are loved by the president,

388
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,950
He will introduce you nice man.

389
00:38:54,727 --> 00:39:00,227
What's wrong with the Takeoka?
It's been about half a month since the ad stopped.

390
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,986
He must have already gone to Chiba

391
00:39:09,637 --> 00:39:13,323
And that's not the case. Takeoka is an honest man

392
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:15,606
Judging from his letters so far,

393
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,116
there is no doubt that he is a serious person

394
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,669
I bet he can't find Machida. so Machida..

395
00:39:40,999 --> 00:39:44,257
Hello, masae-san?

396
00:39:46,006 --> 00:39:47,406
I'm sorry, sorry

397
00:39:48,050 --> 00:40:04,497
I got busy this evening so I forgot...now? but..
I'm off now

398
00:40:08,981 --> 00:40:09,688
Kiku?

399
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,110
Kiku?

400
00:40:16,787 --> 00:40:18,529
Are you going out to your lady's house?

401
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,597
Get ready for a kimono right away

402
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:29,904
There was something burnt inside the cuffs of the kimono

403
00:40:51,764 --> 00:40:55,672
This is a recent Kimono, and I think it would look great on a young lady

404
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,379
I don't really understand

405
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,856
he's coming, please wait a little longer.

406
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:04,853
Don't worry.

407
00:41:05,253 --> 00:41:07,243
This is your business.

408
00:41:07,312 --> 00:41:09,049
Thank you very much.

409
00:41:09,331 --> 00:41:13,665
Mr. Uchibori has been busy.  you decided on the clothes

410
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:17,380
Because even after marriage, I can still get divorced, so he has to choose

411
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:21,233
We have to listen to the opinions of future husband, right?

412
00:41:22,337 --> 00:41:23,756
Thank you very much.

413
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,536
You act like someone.

414
00:41:25,976 --> 00:41:27,660
Of course it's you.

415
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:29,599
I don't remember my mother's face.

416
00:41:31,067 --> 00:41:32,307
Excuse me.

417
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:37,747
I wonder if all the girls these days are so arrogant?

418
00:41:38,165 --> 00:41:41,007
She's pretty nice

419
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,085
Because I raised her.

420
00:41:53,189 --> 00:41:54,476
Excuse me.

421
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:58,251
I'm sorry for bothering you so often

422
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:03,771
Wow! I think this is wonderful.

423
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:05,724
Even though you work at department store.

424
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:09,065
We sell furniture.

425
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,962
I think it would be nice the third one from the other side

426
00:42:12,957 --> 00:42:14,304
You have a good eye.

427
00:42:14,603 --> 00:42:16,690
I didn't ask you.

428
00:42:17,196 --> 00:42:18,047
Sorry.

429
00:42:18,194 --> 00:42:19,674
What do you think?

430
00:42:21,054 --> 00:42:22,893
I don't know.

431
00:42:23,188 --> 00:42:24,234
You're cold.

432
00:42:24,259 --> 00:42:25,501
Oh no.

433
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,130
You're forcing him your own preferences.

434
00:42:29,237 --> 00:42:30,659
That's fine

435
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:35,083
Uchibori

436
00:42:35,730 --> 00:42:39,412
It is difficult to take care of a woman.

437
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,489
I had no intention of raising a child like her.

438
00:42:43,746 --> 00:42:48,205
I strongly protest. you may be a master of Hakata dolls, but

439
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:51,165
But you can't create a human being.

440
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:56,047
I can move left and right and I'm a complete human being

441
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:57,623
Please.

442
00:42:58,556 --> 00:43:00,305
She's like that.

443
00:43:06,864 --> 00:43:11,604
They're going to find out who I am.

444
00:43:16,207 --> 00:43:17,160
Takeoka

445
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:22,245
Please let me know about Machida

446
00:43:50,223 --> 00:43:52,099
Departing for Kansai International Airport South

447
00:43:52,124 --> 00:43:54,329
Please hurry up and get on board

448
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:21,632
You back home early.

449
00:44:22,098 --> 00:44:23,953
I waited for 2 hours but he didn't come

450
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:26,428
You don't trust him after all

451
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:30,599
We're just trading land and buildings.

452
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,906
None of them are available.

453
00:44:37,689 --> 00:44:38,682
But what should we do?

454
00:44:38,707 --> 00:44:39,683
There's no other way

455
00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:43,925
I'll do it no matter what. At this point, I'm just being stubborn

456
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,160
It was close,Takasaki's store.

457
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,153
It was not close

458
00:44:47,909 --> 00:44:51,076
If I told you I'd make it to the store, you wouldn't have been satisfied

459
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,864
So you were satisfied?

460
00:44:56,615 --> 00:44:57,555
You are stupid.

461
00:45:02,237 --> 00:45:03,484
You are stupid.

462
00:45:20,691 --> 00:45:22,618
As you are a member of his family,

463
00:45:22,665 --> 00:45:24,772
I have no choice but to show you

464
00:45:24,814 --> 00:45:26,189
Here it is.

465
00:45:26,370 --> 00:45:36,450
Mr. Takeshi Machida and his wife Natsuko will be staying with us for a week from July 9th,

466
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:38,575
but do you know where they are going?

467
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,985
Yes, please wait a moment

468
00:45:42,064 --> 00:45:43,775
Call Yoshiko.

469
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:00,438
I remember it well because they stayed for 10 nights.

470
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:01,716
I see.

471
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:06,730
She was very beautiful.
He was with her.

472
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:11,650
I'm so envious that they often go out at night

473
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,454
Do you know where they went?

474
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:18,692
Welcome, please come in.

475
00:46:19,329 --> 00:46:22,180
Sorry, come in.

476
00:46:32,462 --> 00:46:34,493
Hello, please. I'd like to ask you something

477
00:46:43,681 --> 00:46:46,837
I'm sorry, but do you know anyone called Machida?

478
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:52,493
Do you know anyone called Machida?

479
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,360
He was in this house

480
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,022
He moved out the day before yesterday.

481
00:46:57,069 --> 00:46:59,130
Do you know where he went?

482
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:00,933
Do you know where he went?

483
00:47:01,242 --> 00:47:02,554
I have no idea.

484
00:47:04,881 --> 00:47:07,715
Everyone in my house is out

485
00:47:30,694 --> 00:47:34,402
Where he went? He is with a woman.

486
00:47:34,426 --> 00:47:36,630
It's different every time I check my fortune

487
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,610
It's like a recent weather forecast.

488
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:44,093
I see.
I should have taken that money and gone to Tokyo.

489
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,222
Stop doing anything like that.

490
00:47:47,726 --> 00:47:49,577
Wait, Yeah.

491
00:47:49,660 --> 00:47:51,832
Southwest.

492
00:47:51,857 --> 00:47:55,632
Southwest?
So..

493
00:47:56,234 --> 00:47:58,211
In the sea.

494
00:47:58,391 --> 00:47:59,578
How can I go there?

495
00:48:00,290 --> 00:48:06,945
I see, I can't keep doing this forever

496
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:12,740
Why don't you try contacting the manager of Omori again?

497
00:48:12,961 --> 00:48:14,086
but it was a waste.

498
00:48:14,138 --> 00:48:16,585
We shouldn't have come to Chiba.

499
00:48:17,501 --> 00:48:21,421
Why don't we just give up on this unnecessary life like that?

500
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:22,961
What do we do?

501
00:48:23,224 --> 00:48:24,713
We'll just have to work harder.

502
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:26,594
I'm sick of that story now

503
00:48:27,334 --> 00:48:28,834
I gave up on the dressmaking shop.

504
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,590
At least we get a sewing machine

505
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,663
No kidding

506
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,360
How much do you think you can make by sewing from morning till night?

507
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,062
Currently, there is no salary of 20,000 yen per month.

508
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,117
buy some watermelon.

509
00:48:51,836 --> 00:48:54,648
buy me some cigarettes too.

510
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:58,875
killed the driver and lost 2000 yen.

511
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:03,390
There are people who can kill a human being for just 2000

512
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:09,945
I have certainly received the 30,000 yen in funds addressed to a hotel in Chiba

513
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:13,500
I apologize for the lack of reporting

514
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,440
After that, the true end

515
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,350
I finally found out that Machida was living with his cousin

516
00:49:19,350 --> 00:49:22,160
It seems that the opening in Chiba is not going as expected

517
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,480
He's been feeling a bit depressed lately, so I've been going to bicycle races and other events

518
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,740
However, living in a hotel would be inconvenient for research and would involve unnecessary expenses,

519
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,218
so I am thinking of moving into an affordable apartment

520
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,990
I'm sorry to say this,

521
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:38,370
but could I borrow 30,000 yen as the key money and 20,000 yen

522
00:49:38,370 --> 00:49:41,380
as the security deposit in total 50,000 yen in advance?

523
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:45,203
I'll deduct 2000 yen from each of my salaries to repay you,

524
00:50:25,140 --> 00:50:27,906
so please prepare 50,000 yen in cash

525
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:28,984
50,000 yen?

526
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:33,148
President, this is just arrived

527
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:34,675
What's wrong?

528
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,230
Isozaki manager just came.

529
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,203
He wants you to use this

530
00:50:39,375 --> 00:50:40,523
No way.

531
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:43,540
I just started to use club, I don't need all that fine stuff

532
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,880
You'll probably end up to buy.

533
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:47,163
If that's the case, then

534
00:50:47,188 --> 00:50:49,219
When did you become a golf club salesman?

535
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:50,760
Sorry

536
00:51:11,265 --> 00:51:13,775
Hello, is this Sumiyoshi's residence?

537
00:51:13,815 --> 00:51:15,335
Is your daughter there?

538
00:51:18,711 --> 00:51:19,742
No worry.

539
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:39,675
Well then,

540
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:42,113
please wait a moment.

541
00:51:59,896 --> 00:52:01,355
Sorry to have kept you waiting

542
00:52:08,882 --> 00:52:11,730
Masae, please don't threaten me.

543
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,210
I won't know if it gets stolen

544
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,703
Where on earth were you going, still leaving it open?

545
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,094
I was meeting with a regular customer.
And you?

546
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,510
flowers?
Let me send you

547
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:28,398
Please take me to your house. I won't disturb you

548
00:52:28,508 --> 00:52:29,781
It's ok.

549
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,585
I want to meet Kiku for the first time in a while and meet you again. I'm doing well

550
00:52:39,555 --> 00:52:40,898
Is she ok?

551
00:52:48,281 --> 00:52:51,476
That girl is a little strange, but she's also kind to me

552
00:52:52,006 --> 00:52:53,851
She was with us for 3 years.

553
00:54:29,801 --> 00:54:36,757
Mr. Machida gave up on opening store and ran out Chiba like a runner.

554
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:41,030
Natsuko left him.

555
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:43,596
He was very depressed.

556
00:54:44,062 --> 00:54:46,533
He headed to the Kansai region alone

557
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:51,200
It seems like recovery is almost hopeless,

558
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,530
but in any case

559
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:56,166
Machida seems to have differentiated itself for some reason

560
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,650
Tell me whether to continue the investigation or not.

561
00:54:59,675 --> 00:55:02,207
I look forward to your support.

562
00:55:08,030 --> 00:55:09,853
He's going to look for me

563
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:16,525
Damn, what is he planning
on doing looking for me?

564
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,528
It's been a while

565
00:55:51,399 --> 00:55:55,274
It's amazing, you can have a branch in Kokura. too

566
00:55:56,188 --> 00:55:57,985
You did a good job

567
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,920
Yes, I heard you have a girlfriend and are getting married soon

568
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:02,932
What do you want?

569
00:56:04,424 --> 00:56:05,799
Don't make that face.

570
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,330
I won't ruin your happiness. You did a good job

571
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:15,502
On the contrary, I am very miserable.

572
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,596
But it's amazing how much they managed to accomplish with that amount of capital

573
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:23,478
We have never met or seen each other

574
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:28,780
We promised like that.

575
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:30,033
I guess so

576
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:35,575
The more I fall, the more I miss you

577
00:56:38,497 --> 00:56:39,731
You...

578
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:45,640
I'll be relaxing in Fukuoka for a while

579
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,368
Get out.

580
00:56:50,203 --> 00:56:51,008
Get out.

581
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:56,211
Are you sure?

582
00:56:57,624 --> 00:57:00,953
You will lose everything.

583
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:06,172
Give me half of your money.

584
00:57:06,977 --> 00:57:09,118
Can you?

585
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:37,641
Oh you.

586
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,242
You were drowning.

587
00:57:44,196 --> 00:57:45,571
Get out.

588
00:58:06,523 --> 00:58:07,819
Let's watch on Machida.

589
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:12,109
I'll keep trying until the end.

590
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:29,094
Please try to relax a little more.

591
00:58:36,437 --> 00:58:37,503
When did you come?

592
00:58:37,635 --> 00:58:38,515
Right now

593
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,609
You didn't notice me.
You were like crazy.

594
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:44,000
Because it doesn't hit very often

595
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:44,645
I get irritated easily

596
00:58:46,226 --> 00:58:47,606
my skills are apparently poor.

597
00:58:47,630 --> 00:58:48,848
I guess that's true,

598
00:58:48,872 --> 00:58:50,180
unfortunately

599
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,156
It's due to psychological reasons?

600
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,680
Does it look like that to you?

601
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,047
It's definitely strange, it's completely different from your usual swing

602
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:07,226
What's wrong?

603
00:59:08,742 --> 00:59:11,976
Nothing . I just can't hit it.

604
00:59:13,545 --> 00:59:17,726
Lie, come on, confess me

605
00:59:19,141 --> 00:59:19,891
No way.

606
00:59:20,289 --> 00:59:21,680
I don't owe you.

607
00:59:22,867 --> 00:59:24,625
I don't owe you too.

608
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:31,711
I already had my husband's secrets before we got married

609
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,812
I'm not feeling well so I'll leave.

610
00:59:49,148 --> 00:59:52,625
Machida, who came to Osaka, has almost no money.

611
00:59:53,134 --> 00:59:56,320
He tried to live in a succession of friends' houses.

612
00:59:56,907 --> 00:59:59,390
but it seems that no one is willing to help him.

613
01:00:48,383 --> 01:00:54,789
Machida, which left Osaka, arrived in Kobe a
few days later and is currently working labor.

614
01:00:57,422 --> 01:00:58,375
Get out

615
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:05,766
Work hard.

616
01:01:08,475 --> 01:01:10,211
Machida moved to Okayama

617
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:14,890
He lives in a construction company as a temporary worker.

618
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:25,695
He is definitely looking for me.

619
01:01:47,953 --> 01:01:50,821
Hello?

620
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:53,844
No no!

621
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:06,890
He probably don't know that I am in Fukuoka.

622
01:02:08,570 --> 01:02:13,023
But he's coming, he's coming

623
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,703
Machida came to Onomichi.

624
01:02:55,859 --> 01:02:58,750
Machida seems to be looking for acquaintances.

625
01:02:59,430 --> 01:03:00,633
A business man.

626
01:03:01,469 --> 01:03:05,937
He was looking for a businessman for the can business.

627
01:03:07,508 --> 01:03:10,016
All I did was tail him.

628
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:13,734
I didn't know who he was looking for.

629
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:18,562
I will be moving to chase Machida.

630
01:03:18,740 --> 01:03:21,664
Please arrange for the payment to be sent to my wife in Chiba.

631
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:18,938
Who?

632
01:04:31,425 --> 01:04:37,476
This kind of person would like to meet you.

633
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:40,336
This person came all the way from Nagoya.

634
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,008
From Nagoya?
What kind of person?

635
01:04:43,375 --> 01:04:45,805
He says He know about you well.

636
01:04:47,469 --> 01:04:48,938
Who?

637
01:04:48,993 --> 01:04:49,735
I'll get you him.

638
01:04:55,594 --> 01:04:56,508
Taguchi.

639
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:15,565
Are you president Uchibori?

640
01:05:15,597 --> 01:05:18,819
I am Gen Okamoto, and I have just given you my business card

641
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:25,060
I put in charge of sales in Kyushu

642
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:26,370
and when I visited the area,

643
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:28,080
the president of Marubori Department Store

644
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,970
happened to be carrying this trunk

645
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:33,550
I knew that you were my senior, so I visited you.

646
01:05:33,575 --> 01:05:35,024
Thanks in advance.

647
01:05:37,219 --> 01:05:39,243
Have a seat.

648
01:05:43,256 --> 01:05:45,295
It's amazing.

649
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:46,922
You made it.

650
01:05:48,304 --> 01:05:50,101
What can I do for you?

651
01:05:50,616 --> 01:05:55,609
Here it is. Please look at this

652
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:01,030
Why don’t you delete this?

653
01:06:01,187 --> 01:06:04,538
In fact, when I received this bag from the company three months ago,

654
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:08,593
I intuitively believed that someone with this name must be successful

655
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:12,515
I'll ask you about the secret of success.

656
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:15,187
Wow, that's really surprising

657
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:19,218
I was able to meet you at the end.

658
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,925
This is awesome.

659
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,930
so I'd like to see the key to success

660
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:27,374
There is no such thing, I'm busy

661
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,440
However, I was able to meet you here

662
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:32,050
I'm glad.

663
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,770
In 5 minutes ok

664
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:36,499
I want you to learn a lesson from you.

665
01:06:37,325 --> 01:06:38,593
I'm sorry, but go home.

666
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,718
Tell Taguchi-kun that and gave him a car.

667
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:46,483
I didn't come here for such a trivial matter.

668
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,610
but I'm going to do my job anyway

669
01:06:49,650 --> 01:06:53,350
I will be traveling around Kyushu and then returning to your area in two weeks

670
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,240
Let me revisit.

671
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,421
I'm sorry to bother you.
Let me take this.

672
01:07:04,679 --> 01:07:08,943
The world seems wide but it's a small place

673
01:07:08,968 --> 01:07:10,702
I'm sorry.

674
01:07:17,070 --> 01:07:18,726
I'm sorry.

675
01:07:32,152 --> 01:07:33,312
Has he gone home?

676
01:07:33,976 --> 01:07:35,055
Taguchi-kun?

677
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:39,718
I'll never meet a stranger again, you know

678
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:45,768
Hello?

679
01:08:46,038 --> 01:08:47,452
don't do anything unnecessary

680
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,749
Who told me to answer the phone?

681
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:54,429
Are you Kiku?
Hikosuke is there?

682
01:08:54,889 --> 01:08:57,619
Hello, hello, hello,

683
01:08:58,187 --> 01:09:00,444
hello, it's me

684
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,976
Sorry, sorry, I was trying to sleep.

685
01:09:03,595 --> 01:09:05,415
No, it's nothing big

686
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:09,095
I'm sure I'm tired. I'm going to rest for another 2,3 days

687
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,243
Thanks a lot

688
01:09:14,773 --> 01:09:16,657
Do not enter this room while I'm out.

689
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:19,517
But...

690
01:09:19,704 --> 01:09:21,415
Don't do anything unnecessary.

691
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:25,423
Masae-san has asked you about me me for something?

692
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:28,790
You're reporting some of my actions to Masae-san, right?

693
01:09:28,790 --> 01:09:29,466
Oh, right?

694
01:09:30,579 --> 01:09:32,485
I don't.

695
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:33,590
Are you doing it yourself?

696
01:09:33,590 --> 01:09:34,360
Or Masae-san asked you?

697
01:09:34,385 --> 01:09:38,212
I really feel sorry for her

698
01:09:39,470 --> 01:09:43,063
Please make sure your make her happy

699
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:49,040
Get out.

700
01:09:51,664 --> 01:09:54,220
I really feel sorry for her

701
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,501
He has about 10 days off.

702
01:10:21,165 --> 01:10:22,905
We are also opening a branch in Kokura,

703
01:10:22,930 --> 01:10:24,320
so we are in trouble.

704
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:25,263
What happened?

705
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:26,868
It seems like he's neurotic.

706
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:27,650
he's neurotic?

707
01:10:28,248 --> 01:10:29,848
He doesn't meet anyone.

708
01:10:29,950 --> 01:10:32,020
and doen not answer the phone

709
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:35,195
I see. I have some urgent business and I really wanted to see him

710
01:10:35,220 --> 01:10:37,680
I asked about here at the post office.

711
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:38,634
at the post office?

712
01:10:39,413 --> 01:10:45,795
please tell him that a man named Takeoka
wants to see him on urgent business

713
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:48,050
Mr. Takeoka?, I understand

714
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:54,290
But I don't know when I'll be able to tell him. So excuse me

715
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:12,250
Let's go! Let's go!

716
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:14,570
Let's go home now

717
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:17,312
It's too late.

718
01:11:17,337 --> 01:11:19,259
let's go, let's go, let's go!

719
01:12:01,556 --> 01:12:04,243
Machida has arrived in Shimonoseki.

720
01:12:16,692 --> 01:12:18,751
With no one to rely on and no money,

721
01:12:18,805 --> 01:12:22,540
he lives alone in a shed used for cable construction on Mt. Volcano

722
01:12:24,545 --> 01:12:26,745
He lives like a homeless person

723
01:12:26,770 --> 01:12:31,391
Moreover,he's been sick for about a week now and am currently in bed

724
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:38,188
Machida seems to still be searching for someone,

725
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:41,446
and while he's here

726
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:47,923
He sent a letter to his cousin in Chiba,But I don't know what it is

727
01:12:50,415 --> 01:12:59,555
Damn, he's finally here, what should I do?

728
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:05,931
Hikosuke?

729
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:12,590
I finally find you.

730
01:13:12,590 --> 01:13:15,735
you're not at the office and I can't get through to you on the phone

731
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,556
I'm sorry,

732
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,446
Please wait a little longer

733
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,579
What am I waiting for?

734
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:25,555
Tell me.

735
01:13:27,283 --> 01:13:29,908
Do you have any concerns?

736
01:13:31,181 --> 01:13:32,017
No.

737
01:13:33,329 --> 01:13:34,210
Let's go home.

738
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,410
But I'm sorry for causing your dad unnecessary worry

739
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:40,384
My father has been in Shimonoseki since yesterday for a business meeting

740
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:58,764
It seems like our family is a bit depressed without our father around

741
01:14:01,361 --> 01:14:04,180
Can I think for a week?

742
01:14:04,978 --> 01:14:05,751
For what?

743
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:09,360
I don't think it's going to be of much use to someone like me to ask

744
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:13,032
I want to think about you suffering in my own way

745
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:15,322
Is that bad?

746
01:14:16,595 --> 01:14:19,782
But I can't say

747
01:14:20,075 --> 01:14:23,345
It's fine, I won't be shaken by any new things

748
01:14:23,370 --> 01:14:26,060
I grew up with only one guy

749
01:14:26,060 --> 01:14:26,829
Masae...

750
01:14:27,079 --> 01:14:28,400
Tell me.

751
01:14:31,977 --> 01:14:35,126
No matter what you say, I can't say it

752
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:41,095
Please, wait a little longer

753
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:43,298
So I can talk about everything

754
01:14:44,615 --> 01:14:47,149
If that's all, why can't you tell now?

755
01:14:49,915 --> 01:14:51,712
Why?

756
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,344
Because I don't want to lose you

757
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:04,532
Masae-san, please wait for another week, no, three days

758
01:15:06,410 --> 01:15:09,782
It may be natural for wait.

759
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:14,337
But I can't wait, I'm that kind of girl

760
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,600
I like Hikosuke

761
01:15:16,625 --> 01:15:19,432
but you won't tell me anything

762
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,273
You don't like me?

763
01:15:22,298 --> 01:15:25,350
No..., I don't want to lose you

764
01:15:25,350 --> 01:15:30,024
That's right. I don't want to lose Hikosuke either.
Please tell me.

765
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:35,905
I'll definitely talk to you tomorrow or the night after tomorrow.

766
01:15:36,077 --> 01:15:40,655
Wait, I'll ask you one more time

767
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,131
Can you please tell me that?

768
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:20,077
What's wrong?

769
01:16:22,436 --> 01:16:24,498
I called out to Uchibori-san

770
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,022
but he just walked away without even turning around

771
01:16:29,991 --> 01:16:30,882
Dad.

772
01:16:32,952 --> 01:16:35,970
Don't get surprised by what I say.

773
01:16:36,032 --> 01:16:40,264
I'm not surprising.
I've been with you 20 years

774
01:16:41,936 --> 01:16:45,328
I might not marry Hikosuke.

775
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,500
Oh you have it.

776
01:16:56,670 --> 01:16:59,148
Can you handle it?

777
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,039
I'll teach you.

778
01:17:02,390 --> 01:17:05,570
Don't forget the important things, they're bullets.

779
01:17:43,209 --> 01:17:45,101
Can I board with you again?

780
01:17:45,188 --> 01:17:46,578
No!
I'm in hurry.

781
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,844
I'll kill him.

782
01:18:26,508 --> 01:18:29,711
For me and Masae.

783
01:19:04,125 --> 01:19:05,375
To Shimonoseki.

784
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:12,333
Wake up,Machida!

785
01:23:17,263 --> 01:23:18,317
Machida!

786
01:23:28,156 --> 01:23:31,285
Uchibori-san
You are finally here.

787
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,423
Who are you?

788
01:23:38,291 --> 01:23:39,283
Takeoka.

789
01:23:40,423 --> 01:23:41,830
I'm employed by you

790
01:23:41,855 --> 01:23:43,323
communicator,Ryoichi Takeoka

791
01:23:48,250 --> 01:23:49,072
Takeoka?

792
01:23:52,072 --> 01:23:52,846
Yes.

793
01:24:00,494 --> 01:24:03,455
I want to say nice to meet you

794
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:06,978
I went to see you but you wouldn't let me see you, so I called you.

795
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:09,830
and I showed the evidence

796
01:24:09,855 --> 01:24:12,416
What kind of evidence is that?

797
01:24:12,664 --> 01:24:13,580
About the murder.

798
01:24:14,932 --> 01:24:17,603
Six years ago, you killed the branch manager of a bank

799
01:24:18,385 --> 01:24:20,908
You stole 5 million yen in bills

800
01:24:30,634 --> 01:24:32,931
You will be honest

801
01:24:40,430 --> 01:24:43,759
So what is your purpose in that?

802
01:24:45,700 --> 01:24:46,790
Don't rush to conclusions

803
01:24:50,630 --> 01:24:53,751
When I received an order from Chiba and a special allowance

804
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:57,415
I vaguely smelled a crime

805
01:24:58,400 --> 01:25:02,783
Just to be sure, if I ask you to send me money, you will have to send money easily.

806
01:25:03,925 --> 01:25:05,814
I thought this was for sure thing.

807
01:25:07,275 --> 01:25:09,221
My wife asked me to report it to police.

808
01:25:10,642 --> 01:25:12,837
Well then, I don't want to repay the favor.

809
01:25:14,275 --> 01:25:20,540
I was visiting the bank and the newspaper that I finally got to know about the murder

810
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:29,908
Thanks to this, I was able to see the back of Japan

811
01:25:31,370 --> 01:25:33,540
But there was a thrill here too

812
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,205
The final communication

813
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,722
You didn't realize that the post stamp was made in Fukuoka

814
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:43,847
That actually had to be sent from Shimonoseki

815
01:25:44,565 --> 01:25:47,894
I asked my wife

816
01:25:48,930 --> 01:25:50,880
But she just couldn't accept it,

817
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,784
We ended up becoming a fighting.

818
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,401
I had no choice but to leave it up to fate

819
01:25:55,644 --> 01:25:57,246
What happened to Machida?

820
01:25:57,814 --> 01:25:59,120
that person?

821
01:26:00,157 --> 01:26:02,596
He was very depressed in Chiba.

822
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:05,300
Now he's recovered and am doing great

823
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:12,136
I've never seen such a strong man. He's different from you

824
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,620
He completely forgot about the past

825
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:18,674
He is a total villain.

826
01:26:19,638 --> 01:26:21,065
You want money?

827
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:21,933
Yes.

828
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:24,190
How much would you give me?

829
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,776
My wife is good at dressmaking.

830
01:26:29,138 --> 01:26:33,284
I wanted to have her open a small shop in Tokyo

831
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:35,065
How much is enough?

832
01:26:37,081 --> 01:26:38,128
Well...

833
01:26:40,565 --> 01:26:44,205
If I had money like the one you held six years ago,

834
01:26:44,230 --> 01:26:47,347
I could make a name for myself

835
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:52,636
You are total villain.

836
01:26:55,620 --> 01:26:58,847
I was originally a serious businessman just like you

837
01:26:59,871 --> 01:27:02,955
But Three years of unemployment ruined me.

838
01:27:08,808 --> 01:27:10,980
Ok let's deal.

839
01:27:12,722 --> 01:27:15,417
Now you can marry the Sugiyoshi girl with peace of mind

840
01:27:17,621 --> 01:27:19,402
How you know?

841
01:27:20,659 --> 01:27:21,815
I did my best.

842
01:27:23,460 --> 01:27:24,378
So let's hurry up

843
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,815
We'll make it to the next cable car.

844
01:27:39,035 --> 01:27:40,589
Let's hurry

845
01:27:48,582 --> 01:27:49,269
Who?

846
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:03,120
It's better to move

847
01:28:05,089 --> 01:28:05,957
Who?

848
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:14,058
Machida.

849
01:28:15,894 --> 01:28:17,597
Wait.

850
01:28:22,175 --> 01:28:23,402
You're Takeoka,right?

851
01:28:24,472 --> 01:28:26,909
I've known about what you've done for a long time.

852
01:28:28,130 --> 01:28:30,415
That clerk, Omori, is a man who is weak when it comes to money

853
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:34,550
He made a deal with you the first time you met.

854
01:28:38,570 --> 01:28:42,085
I moved to Chiba and gradually began to understand your feelings

855
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:54,343
Since then, I've followed you around and made it this far

856
01:29:01,617 --> 01:29:02,484
Uchibori.

857
01:29:03,763 --> 01:29:07,129
If we let this guy live, we'll ruin.

858
01:29:15,270 --> 01:29:16,437
Now it's your turn

859
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:18,178
Clean it up quickly.

860
01:29:21,018 --> 01:29:25,035
it's my fault

861
01:29:26,810 --> 01:29:33,810
Forgive me, forgive me

862
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:44,487
I apologize for that.

863
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,568
Shoot him,Uchibori!

864
01:29:56,912 --> 01:29:58,245
Let me go!

865
01:30:00,175 --> 01:30:01,555
Shoot him.

866
01:30:23,300 --> 01:30:25,759
Why didn't you shoot?

867
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:35,443
You were looking for me to kill me

868
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:31,562
He was killed.

869
01:31:32,644 --> 01:31:33,751
He was killed?

870
01:31:36,803 --> 01:31:37,843
Takeoka?

871
01:31:39,071 --> 01:31:40,458
Takeoka!

872
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:51,333
Hello?

873
01:31:52,188 --> 01:31:54,228
Etsuko!

874
01:31:58,912 --> 01:32:00,312
You.

875
01:32:08,038 --> 01:32:10,035
Ok that's done.

876
01:32:14,106 --> 01:32:19,293
It's hot and muggy. There's no wind at all

877
01:32:23,535 --> 01:32:27,065
To be honest, when your wife jumps in,

878
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:29,514
I had no idea what was going on

879
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:33,177
But thanks to that, it didn't become a crime

880
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:36,052
You have to be grateful to your wife.

881
01:32:36,680 --> 01:32:39,430
This brings an end to a cold case

882
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:44,622
We are celebrating,
You were just tired.

883
01:32:45,900 --> 01:32:49,372
Well, luckily there were few injuries

884
01:32:51,215 --> 01:32:54,855
I don't know what would have happened to you if you hadn't had a wife.

885
01:32:54,893 --> 01:32:56,213
Yes, seriously.

886
01:32:56,526 --> 01:32:58,331
We are glad this problem was solved.

887
01:33:02,816 --> 01:33:07,994
Please take this opportunity to think seriously.

888
01:33:09,268 --> 01:33:10,284
Yes.

889
01:33:11,635 --> 01:33:12,861
But still, it's late.

890
01:33:12,886 --> 01:33:15,682
Maybe it's time , it's coming soon.

891
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,330
Here we come, Let's go.

892
01:33:24,330 --> 01:33:28,070
But you did come up with a plan for the detective novel.

893
01:34:02,557 --> 01:34:12,262
THE END

2
00:00:22,806 --> 00:00:28,111
Year 1940, early summer
Shanghai

3
00:00:45,739 --> 00:00:48,485
What the hell?

4
00:00:56,443 --> 00:01:00,181
I am a state officer.
Something is wrong

5
00:01:00,784 --> 00:01:04,668
You are an enemy

6
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:09,099
Me?
Don't make a fool of me

7
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:12,860
Shut your mouth

8
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,764
You leaked confidential military information to the enemy

9
00:01:19,713 --> 00:01:20,449
No way

10
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,139
I know What did you tell

11
00:01:24,545 --> 00:01:28,418
Army permission is required to arrest me

12
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,565
Do you get it?

13
00:01:32,347 --> 00:01:34,568
You should complain in Tokyo

14
00:01:38,989 --> 00:01:42,248
I have no idea why I arrested

15
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,320
Anyway I was sent to Japan main land

16
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,074
<i>Tokyo Military Police</i>

17
00:02:04,185 --> 00:02:05,993
Come in

18
00:02:26,757 --> 00:02:28,286
I don't know at all

19
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:33,353
You don't know but other side know it

20
00:02:33,967 --> 00:02:34,826
other side?

21
00:02:35,016 --> 00:02:41,087
Yes, The enemy in Chongqing said they bought information from you

22
00:02:41,947 --> 00:02:42,784
What kind of information?

23
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:43,866
Don't pretend you don't know

24
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:47,862
I torture you

25
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:00,142
Say it!

26
00:03:13,082 --> 00:03:14,589
Get up!

27
00:03:36,272 --> 00:03:37,823
Get up!

28
00:03:56,454 --> 00:04:05,985
The School of Spies 4:
Top Secret Command

29
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,063
Get up!

30
00:04:53,945 --> 00:04:55,373
Mr. Takakura

31
00:04:56,612 --> 00:05:01,846
I want to release you.
Please promise one

32
00:05:03,844 --> 00:05:07,583
Please refrain from making statements that violate national policy in the future

33
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:14,056
I don't know how I got caught by the Kempeitai.

34
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,297
I haven't violated the law

35
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:23,476
You guys are in trouble because you can't prosecute me

36
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,623
Please change your mind

37
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:32,337
He doesn't say anything

38
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:40,735
Sit down

39
00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:53,062
You should reflect for a while.

40
00:06:08,329 --> 00:06:12,715
You can be in prison for 10 or 20 years if you don't be honest

41
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:17,793
I have a favor

42
00:06:18,217 --> 00:06:19,222
What?

43
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:29,752
Please contact Lieutenant Colonel Kusanagi of the Army

44
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:40,868
I want him to ask you what I am

45
00:06:42,337 --> 00:06:43,955
I will ask him

46
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:47,527
I wonder what he says

47
00:06:50,005 --> 00:06:51,601
Connect to Lieutenant Colonel Kusanagi

48
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:58,208
Hello?
I'm Kusanagi

49
00:06:59,101 --> 00:07:00,618
Oh How are you?

50
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:03,922
Do you know a person named Jiro Shiina?

51
00:07:04,167 --> 00:07:05,741
He is from Nakano School

52
00:07:08,574 --> 00:07:12,380
I see.
He seems to be disappointed with you

53
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,493
Let me talk with him

54
00:07:17,234 --> 00:07:18,697
He wants to talk with you

55
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,155
Hello?
Are you Lieutenant Colonel Kusanagi?

56
00:07:27,757 --> 00:07:29,990
I'm Jiro Shiina

57
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:36,608
Your traitorous behavior disappoints me.

58
00:07:38,304 --> 00:07:39,688
I had no eyes to see

59
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:42,791
What?
Hello?

60
00:07:43,472 --> 00:07:46,373
Are you really Lieutenant Colonel Kusanagi?

61
00:07:47,702 --> 00:07:50,436
I don't want to talk to you

62
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:52,333
Hello?

63
00:07:52,858 --> 00:07:54,164
Hello?

64
00:08:23,062 --> 00:08:24,312
Are you OK?

65
00:08:26,812 --> 00:08:28,799
They are so terrible

66
00:08:34,104 --> 00:08:36,604
Wipe your body

67
00:08:39,282 --> 00:08:41,302
You are wetting

68
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,490
They are so terrible

69
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:46,693
They are devils

70
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:53,981
I'm an old man so they don't hit.
But I've been here for 10 days now

71
00:08:58,616 --> 00:09:02,701
You are a former Foreign Minister, right?

72
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,632
I'm Takakura

73
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:07,311
That's what I thought

74
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:09,219
You?

75
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:12,288
I'm Shiina

76
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:16,418
Why they put you here?

77
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:20,949
I have no idea

78
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,509
I don't remember doing anything wrong

79
00:09:26,407 --> 00:09:28,226
same with me

80
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:33,058
Japan is no longer a law-abiding country

81
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,083
Don't have a conversation

82
00:09:37,121 --> 00:09:44,554
After a week I felt very desperate

83
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:49,565
I'm trying to find some hidden truth

84
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,542
What's wrong?

85
00:09:55,726 --> 00:09:57,043
I have a chronic illness

86
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,112
What's wrong?

87
00:10:00,357 --> 00:10:02,322
I have a pain in my back and lower back

88
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,543
It hurts when the temperature gets cold

89
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,953
I'll massage you

90
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,721
Thanks

91
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:17,395
How's it?

92
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:18,946
Thanks

93
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:22,785
Roll call!

94
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:26,379
Roll call is coming

95
00:10:26,624 --> 00:10:28,265
Don't worry

96
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:29,939
Roll call!

97
00:10:30,486 --> 00:10:35,229
Call a doctor because he has neuralgia

98
00:10:35,254 --> 00:10:36,703
You have to sit upright during the roll call

99
00:10:36,859 --> 00:10:40,051
Bring a little blanket

100
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,071
He's old

101
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:43,488
Shut up!

102
00:10:44,381 --> 00:10:46,825
You had better not rebel against them

103
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:50,720
Shiina.
You have an order

104
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:56,915
You have been demoted from Lieutenant Army to First Class Army

105
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,206
Another 1 week passed

106
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:14,373
I and Mr. Takakura have become very close to each other.

107
00:11:14,762 --> 00:11:17,809
I want to go to toilet

108
00:11:18,244 --> 00:11:21,247
You be a little patient

109
00:11:22,084 --> 00:11:23,858
I'm old so I can't be patient

110
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:27,106
You have to go to the bathroom every four hours.

111
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:28,836
You should wait

112
00:11:29,237 --> 00:11:31,146
I can't wait

113
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:35,041
This is a physiological desire

114
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:36,582
Let him go

115
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:38,468
What?

116
00:11:39,026 --> 00:11:41,492
You're just a guard, right?

117
00:11:42,229 --> 00:11:44,729
You have a responsibility to protect him

118
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,026
He has no choice but to pee here

119
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,820
Is that ok with you?

120
00:11:58,617 --> 00:11:59,968
Get back early

121
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:25,651
Be quiet

122
00:12:37,188 --> 00:12:38,494
Get out Shiina First Class Army

123
00:12:41,986 --> 00:12:44,263
You will be released

124
00:12:53,665 --> 00:12:55,942
Good for you

125
00:12:57,448 --> 00:12:59,279
Thank you for everything

126
00:12:59,915 --> 00:13:02,002
Thank you for taking care of me

127
00:13:02,337 --> 00:13:05,629
Please take care of yourself

128
00:13:06,656 --> 00:13:10,227
See you again if you have the opportunity

129
00:13:13,163 --> 00:13:15,283
You have been prosecuted

130
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:21,823
Don't put you in the army because it's dangerous to have someone like you in the army

131
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,718
It's been a while,Jiro

132
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:31,031
I'm Sanpei.
I came on behalf of my uncle today

133
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,709
You look fine

134
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,600
I thought you were very depressed

135
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:39,837
Who the hell is he

136
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:45,104
I decided to have a conversation with him

137
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:51,739
How's uncle?

138
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,120
He's busy.
Let's go

139
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:08,979
Please tell me why you came here

140
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,202
Thank you for your hard work.
Come in

141
00:14:31,989 --> 00:14:33,395
I'm sorry

142
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:40,549
I took such steps to bring you closer to Mr. Takakura

143
00:14:42,566 --> 00:14:44,050
He's your junior

144
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:47,521
I'm Kariya, a third year student at Nakano School

145
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:52,878
Mr. Takakura will be released

146
00:14:53,894 --> 00:15:02,041
This case is related to Japanese politics

147
00:15:04,627 --> 00:15:09,672
Late last year we got word that Cat's Eye had infiltrated Japan.

148
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:11,558
Cat's Eye

149
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:16,144
Codename of the British Intelligence Agency in Singapore

150
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,616
We couldn't get that information

151
00:15:20,442 --> 00:15:23,265
German intelligence has contacted us

152
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,085
English?

153
00:15:25,632 --> 00:15:27,920
I don't know the race yet

154
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:32,987
Perhaps they are Japanese.

155
00:15:34,661 --> 00:15:40,163
It turns out that Japan's national policy is leaked to the US and British sides

156
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:47,294
Information on Japan's measures against China and Europe has leaked

157
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:52,484
We have to find that cat's eye

158
00:15:53,991 --> 00:15:57,607
I left that assignment to your colleague,Kubota.

159
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:02,473
He found the identity of Cat's Eye

160
00:16:03,478 --> 00:16:06,825
But he was killed just before reporting to me

161
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:08,388
He was killed?

162
00:16:09,806 --> 00:16:14,348
Here is a picture of his corpse

163
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:22,864
He was killed with a pistol.
His notebook was found later

164
00:16:24,259 --> 00:16:28,199
According to his notebook, he said that Takakura's friendship was a problem.

165
00:16:30,967 --> 00:16:32,708
He is a Catholic Father Rogers

166
00:16:33,924 --> 00:16:36,089
He is a correspondent for Mr. haydon of the Canadian News Agency

167
00:16:37,451 --> 00:16:39,527
Mr. Clark, a trader

168
00:16:40,621 --> 00:16:44,036
She is the widow of Baron Asai with foreign connections.

169

170
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:53,087
Kubota tried to find Cat's Eye among them

171
00:16:54,728 --> 00:16:57,696
He wrote this at the end of the notebook

172
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:09,806
An unexpected fact was discovered but I can't conclude it

173
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:13,578
He found cat's eye

174
00:17:14,292 --> 00:17:17,384
He didn't report to me because he wasn't confident

175
00:17:18,422 --> 00:17:19,716
That was problem

176
00:17:21,212 --> 00:17:26,480
If you should, be sure to report everything to me and die

177
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:29,716
I get it

178
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:34,504
Let's meet at the inn here when talking to me

179
00:17:35,576 --> 00:17:38,857
You should not go to the General Staff except in an emergency

180
00:17:40,408 --> 00:17:42,574
The enemy may be among our own people.

181
00:17:49,315 --> 00:17:56,357
A few days later I got a new mission

182
00:17:57,362 --> 00:18:06,848
The mountains of Hakone around here were very quiet

183
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:21,452
Shall I help you?

184
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:39,985
thank you very much

185
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,687
I'm Jiro Shiina.
Is Mr.Takakura here?

186
00:19:16,123 --> 00:19:17,819
What can I do for you?

187
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,742
I just happened to be here

188
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:24,091
Did you make an appointment with him?

189
00:19:24,448 --> 00:19:29,794
Because he said he wanted to see me

190
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:33,454
Wait a min

191
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:37,908
Oh

192
00:19:52,011 --> 00:19:55,047
Mr Shiina visited you

193
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,868
Oh you

194
00:20:00,371 --> 00:20:02,748
Thank you for that time

195
00:20:03,094 --> 00:20:05,571
Have a seat

196
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,111
How is your health?

197
00:20:12,172 --> 00:20:15,174
My health is not very good

198
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:16,569
That's bad

199
00:20:16,826 --> 00:20:18,589
Take it

200
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:23,969
That place was really terrible

201
00:20:25,173 --> 00:20:29,068
You helped me a lot

202
00:20:29,447 --> 00:20:31,746
He helped you?

203
00:20:31,914 --> 00:20:34,681
Yes he did

204
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:36,791
thank you very much

205
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,465
Not at all

206
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:45,217
I was released the day after you were released

207
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:47,483
I have not been prosecuted

208
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:54,860
I'm in trouble if an idiot has power

209
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:58,498
They are insane

210
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:02,204
They are so bad

211
00:21:05,675 --> 00:21:07,728
Excuse me earlier

212
00:21:09,356 --> 00:21:10,427
What's wrong?

213
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:14,177
I was suspicious of her

214
00:21:14,546 --> 00:21:16,599
I didn't mean that

215
00:21:18,563 --> 00:21:20,583
Did you get mistaken for the right wing?

216
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:25,310
They come here every day

217
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,986
Do I look right wing?

218
00:21:30,901 --> 00:21:34,964
We are sensitive

219
00:21:35,578 --> 00:21:38,089
Why don't you ask the police for security?

220
00:21:38,379 --> 00:21:40,399
I asked him but

221
00:21:41,192 --> 00:21:44,696
I don't trust police

222
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:47,073
What do you do now?

223
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:49,183
I have free time now

224
00:21:49,495 --> 00:21:50,477
I see

225
00:21:51,649 --> 00:21:54,640
How about you playing here for a couple of days?

226
00:21:55,198 --> 00:21:58,524
The air here is clean and good for your health.

227
00:21:59,026 --> 00:21:59,886
Thank you

228
00:22:04,946 --> 00:22:06,776
This is a quiet and very nice room

229
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:09,053
How about taking a bath?

230
00:22:09,354 --> 00:22:10,593
Thank you

231
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:14,403
Shiina-san..well

232
00:22:14,682 --> 00:22:15,419
What?

233
00:22:15,943 --> 00:22:17,294
I have a favor of you

234
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:27,338
Recently, many right-wing people come to our house.

235
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:29,827
I am very worried

236
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:34,146
Do I guard your father?

237
00:22:34,358 --> 00:22:37,919
If you can, I'm very relieved

238
00:22:39,886 --> 00:22:40,868
I wonder if I can

239
00:22:41,124 --> 00:22:44,629
Please by all means

240
00:22:45,153 --> 00:22:46,883
He may refuse

241
00:22:47,308 --> 00:22:49,763
I convince him

242
00:22:52,993 --> 00:22:54,634
I get it

243
00:22:56,486 --> 00:23:01,888
The damage caused by the air raids in London was great, and now the German army is dominant.

244
00:23:02,658 --> 00:23:09,611
However, the power of the British people, led by Prime Minister Churchill, is very strong.

245
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:13,658
Japanese soldiers don't understand it

246
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,196
You were a soldier

247
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:19,830
I was fired a soldier

248
00:23:20,744 --> 00:23:26,737
British troops are supported by the United States

249
00:23:27,062 --> 00:23:35,164
I think the spirit of the army is very important

250
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:41,025
I think British people are very spiritual

251
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:45,489
You think so?
What do you think?

252
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,413
I think he's right

253
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:54,329
I think it is impossible to invade other peoples

254
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:57,175
History show it

255
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,639
Have you seen the Yangtze River?

256
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:10,187
I don't think the Japanese can invade China if they see that big river

257
00:24:12,206 --> 00:24:16,168
That river has been Chinese for a long time

258
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:19,606
Forever in the future

259
00:24:20,632 --> 00:24:26,403
I am very concerned about the direction Japan is heading right now.

260
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:31,140
I have to change the way of Japan

261
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:42,055
The next evening, a consolation party was held for Mr. Takakura.

262
00:24:43,004 --> 00:24:45,280
British Ambassador and Mrs. Lehman

263
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:53,979
US Ambassador and Mrs. Carlson

264
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:57,617
French Ambassador and Mrs. Manuel

265
00:24:58,488 --> 00:25:02,271
They were high-ranking officials of the anti-Axis powers

266
00:25:11,975 --> 00:25:16,038
Among them was Rogers, who Kubota was aiming for.

267
00:25:22,334 --> 00:25:28,796
In addition, there was Mr. Hate, Mr. Clark, and Mr. Takezo Sakagami.

268
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,633
Ladies Asai and others were also coming

269
00:25:36,653 --> 00:25:39,834
Who's he?

270
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:46,095
He is Mr. Shiina who is my father's bodyguard

271
00:25:46,575 --> 00:25:48,517
He's not police

272
00:25:48,874 --> 00:25:50,470
I get it

273
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:53,796
He needs a body guard

274
00:25:53,821 --> 00:25:55,705
I'll bring him

275
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,741
Excuse me

276
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:11,451
He is Mr. Sakagami of Japan Times

277
00:26:11,476 --> 00:26:12,823
I'm Shiina

278
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:17,432
Thank you for his bodyguard

279
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:21,238
He's clerk

280
00:26:21,462 --> 00:26:23,727
How do you do?

281
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:40,226
The guests here are no longer wary of me.
I decided to approach the least cautious of him.

282
00:26:45,081 --> 00:26:46,956
Do you want another glass of wine?

283
00:27:39,338 --> 00:27:40,978
Would you like?

284
00:27:41,213 --> 00:27:44,137
I'm already drunk

285
00:27:44,485 --> 00:27:47,900
She was the least careful.

286
00:27:48,816 --> 00:27:52,811
She was born in Vienna and her dead husband was a diplomat.

287
00:27:53,168 --> 00:27:59,630
She is a woman who knows a lot about the relationship between America and England

288
00:28:02,133 --> 00:28:08,874
Mr. Takakura found a bodyguard who is fluent in foreign languages

289
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:10,838
Thank you

290
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:13,695
Do you like dancing?

291
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,436
I like

292
00:28:15,793 --> 00:28:19,588
I heard that all dance halls will be banned

293
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:21,753
So I should dance before it

294
00:28:22,345 --> 00:28:24,566
It seems that listening to jazz is also prohibited.

295
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:27,791
It will be a very boring world

296
00:28:32,498 --> 00:28:33,837
Where's Shiina?

297
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:40,790
Asai's wife got drunk and couldn't drive, so he went to send her

298
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:47,527
What do you think of him?

299
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,507
What do you mean?

300
00:28:52,237 --> 00:28:55,239
I feel something strange about him

301
00:29:00,388 --> 00:29:01,828
What do you mean?

302
00:29:03,067 --> 00:29:05,344
He was a lieutenant in the army

303
00:29:06,694 --> 00:29:13,915
Military personnel who are fluent in foreign languages are a little rare

304
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:15,645
So what?

305
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,627
For what purpose is he approaching me?

306
00:29:22,274 --> 00:29:25,913
Do you doubt him?

307
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,082
He's good man

308
00:29:47,001 --> 00:29:48,318
Arrived

309
00:29:52,626 --> 00:29:54,178
Would you come to my house?

310
00:29:56,639 --> 00:29:58,771
Don't worry

311
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,390
Do you want water?

312
00:33:41,159 --> 00:33:45,545
It was late yesterday so I stayed at a friend's house

313
00:33:49,483 --> 00:34:01,102
My daughter is still young.
We have a bad reputation from your neighborhood when you are at home

314
00:34:01,735 --> 00:34:02,840
I know

315
00:34:02,865 --> 00:34:09,436
I don't like having a bodyguard

316
00:34:09,892 --> 00:34:11,388
I'm sorry

317
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:12,962
Not at all

318
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:17,003
I'm leaving now

319
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:35,939
Shiina-san

320
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:58,212
What's wrong with Shiina-san?

321
00:34:59,629 --> 00:35:00,767
What's wrong ?

322
00:35:01,783 --> 00:35:03,200
He left

323
00:35:03,937 --> 00:35:07,207
Why?
That's rude

324
00:35:07,977 --> 00:35:10,220
I have taken care of him a lot

325
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:16,683
Wait!
Don't chase him

326
00:35:18,902 --> 00:35:22,852
He noticed something and his attitude changed suddenly

327
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:28,165
He's very cautious

328
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:35,799
His daughter likes me.
I'll get closer to him again

329
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,016
I think I will take the other way

330
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:48,181
I am an information clerk
I have disclosed my identity

331
00:35:49,554 --> 00:35:52,712
I did so because I trust you

332
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:57,813
What do you want to know from me?

333
00:35:59,954 --> 00:36:03,916
You have a close relationship with foreign officials, right?

334
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:05,925
So?

335
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:11,048
Do you know the word cat's eye?

336
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,591
Is it a jewel?

337
00:36:14,892 --> 00:36:18,798
It's the code of the British intelligence agency

338
00:36:19,479 --> 00:36:21,578
They infiltrated Japan last fall

339
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:27,199
Since then, Japan's top secret has leaked to the United States and Britain

340
00:36:29,509 --> 00:36:35,803
I think they are impersonating another person

341
00:36:36,373 --> 00:36:40,725
You have a strong relationship with the United States and the United Kingdom

342
00:36:41,451 --> 00:36:47,344
If I'm Cat's Eye I'll get closer to you

343
00:36:47,969 --> 00:36:50,558
Shut up!
You are rude

344
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:53,565
Mind your mouth

345
00:36:55,551 --> 00:36:57,437
Do you think my friend has a spy?

346
00:36:57,527 --> 00:36:59,045
I don't mean that

347
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:04,893
You think because you are a spy, others are too.

348
00:37:05,797 --> 00:37:11,289
I hate spies
They are so mean

349
00:37:11,869 --> 00:37:14,492
Leave here!

350
00:37:16,558 --> 00:37:18,110
You're rude

351
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:19,873
Shut up!

352
00:37:20,911 --> 00:37:23,032
I'm sorry

353
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:37,035
Shiina-san

354
00:37:41,774 --> 00:37:45,736
My dad did something rude to you

355
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,939
I couldn't tell him well

356
00:37:51,703 --> 00:37:54,069
He's very frustrated lately

357
00:37:55,642 --> 00:38:00,196
I want you and my dad to work together

358
00:38:02,983 --> 00:38:06,777
I believe you are a great person

359
00:38:09,188 --> 00:38:11,945
I have a favor to ask from you

360
00:38:13,976 --> 00:38:16,420
Can you help me with my work?

361
00:38:17,111 --> 00:38:25,672
Your dad knows some important information so I have to know it

362
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,357
Do you have lover?

363
00:38:54,451 --> 00:38:56,192
I don't have

364
00:38:56,873 --> 00:39:00,177
You are very handsome
Young women like you

365
00:39:01,564 --> 00:39:03,495
I hate young women

366
00:39:05,181 --> 00:39:06,230
They are too childish

367
00:39:11,822 --> 00:39:12,703
What's wrong?

368
00:39:12,893 --> 00:39:14,746
Nothing

369
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:27,829
I know this man

370
00:39:41,641 --> 00:39:48,494
I was followed by this guy in Shanghai last summer

371
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,463
He's in Tokyo now

372
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,483
You know him?

373
00:39:55,264 --> 00:39:56,235
No

374
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,414
I feel like drinking

375
00:40:09,244 --> 00:40:12,380
Let's go for a drink

376
00:40:22,578 --> 00:40:23,638
What's wrong?

377
00:40:24,229 --> 00:40:25,468
I will reserve a room

378
00:40:42,812 --> 00:40:44,631
Hello.
It's me

379
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:48,493
There is a man playing the clarinet in a dance hall

380
00:40:49,006 --> 00:40:53,560
I want you to watch him

381
00:40:55,268 --> 00:41:01,306
He is definitely a member of the enemy camp

382
00:41:01,919 --> 00:41:04,129
I get it

383
00:41:24,018 --> 00:41:25,826
Thank you

384
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:40,607
Turn off the lights and prepare for an air raid

385
00:41:48,092 --> 00:41:50,413
I like dark

386
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,566
What's wrong?

387
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:06,320
What do you do to me?

388
00:42:06,956 --> 00:42:12,202
This is Muhi.
You smell like Muhi

389
00:42:14,467 --> 00:42:16,476
How did you get this?

390
00:42:16,856 --> 00:42:18,519
It's none of your business

391
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,900
That's my secret

392
00:42:23,084 --> 00:42:25,360
I want to know your secret

393
00:42:26,521 --> 00:42:30,863
The police crackdown is strict now

394
00:42:31,994 --> 00:42:33,077
Can I take a guess?

395
00:42:36,704 --> 00:42:37,675
Who the hell you are?

396
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:40,934
How did you get this?

397
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:44,840
I can keep your secret

398
00:42:46,536 --> 00:42:48,378
Trust me

399
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:57,247
I got it from the German embassy

400
00:42:58,351 --> 00:42:59,088
German

401
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:08,441
I tell them the information about Takakura and they give me drugs

402
00:43:12,442 --> 00:43:20,902
Now that the world is boring, I want to forget about taking drugs

403
00:43:24,386 --> 00:43:25,904
You get money too?

404
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:32,434
yes , this is good business

405
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,253
I think so

406
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:38,516
Do you wanna work with me?

407
00:43:50,113 --> 00:43:55,001
He was a man named Koyanagi and joined the band last October.

408
00:43:56,061 --> 00:44:00,492
He lives in an old apartment and commute by bicycle

409
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:08,483
There is always a foreign car parked in front of his apartment

410
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:13,900
I searched for the owner from the car number, but it was a fictitious person

411
00:44:15,128 --> 00:44:17,884
He sometimes goes to the coffee shop

412
00:44:19,146 --> 00:44:23,331
This coffee shop is very long-established

413
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:28,476
Owner changed 3 years ago

414
00:44:30,946 --> 00:44:35,232
Owner brings coffee to the British Embassy once a week

415
00:44:38,335 --> 00:44:43,234
I checked Koyanagi's locker and found nothing suspicious

416
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,270
Thank you for your work

417
00:44:48,361 --> 00:44:54,968
If he came to Japan last October, it would be the same time as Cat's Eye.

418
00:44:55,828 --> 00:44:58,049
It's very happening

419
00:44:58,406 --> 00:45:00,761
I think he has something to do with them

420
00:45:05,282 --> 00:45:07,079
I'll find out

421
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:15,770
Did you call me?

422
00:45:16,094 --> 00:45:20,602
Japan's highest secret leaked again

423
00:45:22,489 --> 00:45:27,433
All negotiations between Japan and Germany leaked

424
00:45:28,203 --> 00:45:34,096
It also contains information on national policy.

425
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:35,495
I’m sorry

426
00:45:35,763 --> 00:45:37,348
What are you doing!

427
00:45:37,951 --> 00:45:41,567
There was a protest from the German embassy

428
00:45:41,711 --> 00:45:47,649
Then we found out.
We lost all face.

429
00:45:48,635 --> 00:45:54,684
We are now fighting England in Europe

430
00:45:56,479 --> 00:46:00,118
I want the Japanese government to cooperate more

431
00:46:04,191 --> 00:46:07,618
Japanese intelligence agencies can't work

432
00:46:08,912 --> 00:46:11,769
You guys don't know anything about Cat's Eye

433
00:46:14,861 --> 00:46:20,464
We cannot have military talks with Japan.

434
00:46:24,104 --> 00:46:29,551
We have two weeks to find the cat's eye.

435
00:46:34,531 --> 00:46:36,585
Sorry for the inconvenience

436
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:45,636
I think you should be careful of Baroness Asai

437
00:46:46,149 --> 00:46:47,165
What do you mean?

438
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:49,654
She is a drug addict

439
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:51,373
She?

440
00:46:54,241 --> 00:46:56,361
I didn't know that

441
00:46:57,265 --> 00:47:02,310
We have face.
We will find Cat's Eye within 2 weeks

442
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:05,078
I wanted to say that

443
00:47:08,705 --> 00:47:11,015
We will find Cat's Eye within 2 weeks

444
00:47:11,975 --> 00:47:13,169
Do you have any clues?

445
00:47:13,504 --> 00:47:15,848
I only have the clues about Koyanagi

446
00:49:19,503 --> 00:49:21,289
Who's the hell you are?

447
00:49:48,109 --> 00:49:49,381
Shit

448
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:54,559
Why did you go inside his house?

449
00:49:56,602 --> 00:49:59,437
I wanted to find some clues

450
00:50:00,441 --> 00:50:01,412
What are you going to do?

451
00:50:02,818 --> 00:50:03,823
I'll find out

452
00:50:03,968 --> 00:50:09,046
I mean What do you do with the responsibility for failure?

453
00:50:12,316 --> 00:50:15,463
Please fire me

454
00:50:22,512 --> 00:50:26,418
You're spoiling it for me.

455
00:50:30,905 --> 00:50:38,740
Nakano School has no hierarchical relationship, so there are only orders

456
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:50,224
If Koyanagi is Cat's Eye, that's a terrible problem.

457
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:53,076
You are seriously responsible

458
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:58,154
You get it?

459
00:50:59,694 --> 00:51:00,676
Yes

460
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,435
Write your will.

461
00:52:00,359 --> 00:52:02,535
Write your will.

462
00:52:07,334 --> 00:52:13,250
All you have to do is write a short sentence and sign it

463
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:40,175
I wrote it

464
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:43,666
Drink it

465
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,267
Good.
You graduated from Nakano School now

466
00:53:27,832 --> 00:53:30,198
This is just water

467
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:39,298
I order you again.
Find Koyanagi again

468
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:45,928
Keep an eye on the owner of that coffee shop

469
00:53:49,503 --> 00:53:50,865
Thank you

470
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:56,936
Don't cry

471
00:53:57,829 --> 00:53:59,224
I see

472
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:38,763
There was a party at the Winter Palace when I was the British Ambassador

473
00:54:41,174 --> 00:54:44,020
It was very hot in the summer at that time

474
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:48,027
I drank too much

475
00:54:49,444 --> 00:54:52,380
There was someone in the bathroom

476
00:54:53,574 --> 00:55:00,393
The British Prime Minister was talking to someone

477
00:55:03,112 --> 00:55:10,054
I thought the man was a spy

478
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:16,048
However, last fall

479
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:21,349
I saw the man in Tokyo

480
00:55:33,495 --> 00:55:35,325
I don't know any more

481
00:55:38,338 --> 00:55:39,711
Thank you

482
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:43,149
This isn't helpful on its own.

483
00:55:44,164 --> 00:55:50,414
My dad won't tell me anything more

484
00:55:52,702 --> 00:55:58,707
You have a hard time looking up your dad, right?

485
00:55:59,209 --> 00:56:00,939
It would be fine with me

486
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:07,555
He is careful around himself

487
00:56:09,642 --> 00:56:13,448
I would be happy to be of service to you.

488
00:56:15,736 --> 00:56:21,004
I want to see the British spy your dad saw in Tokyo

489
00:56:24,938 --> 00:56:26,556
Does your father write a diary?

490
00:56:26,645 --> 00:56:27,572
Yes

491
00:56:28,041 --> 00:56:30,038
Look at that diary so he can't find it

492
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:36,567
If the man's information is written, please copy it

493
00:56:44,005 --> 00:56:46,639
I think you will be happy today

494
00:56:46,664 --> 00:56:48,693
What's wrong?

495
00:56:49,496 --> 00:56:58,436
The three countries of the United States, the United Kingdom and France are planning to ask Mr. Takakura to realize peace work with China.

496
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:02,633
Does the Japanese government know that?

497
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:07,934
The upper management knows it, but the military does not.

498
00:57:09,619 --> 00:57:10,903
Thanks

499
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:24,353
Do you have any information about Cat's Eye?

500
00:57:28,605 --> 00:57:32,087
I'm infiltrating the British Embassy and investigating

501
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:36,194
I want valuable information

502
00:57:37,076 --> 00:57:41,886
I would love to know more about catchers

503
00:57:57,103 --> 00:57:59,457
She will go home

504
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:03,118
See you

505
00:58:30,301 --> 00:58:31,540
I couldn't find it

506
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:37,958
He may not come to the coffee shop anymore

507
00:58:40,521 --> 00:58:43,746
Another week has passed

508
00:58:44,829 --> 00:58:46,525
How about Kidnap him?

509
00:58:47,195 --> 00:58:47,720
Do you have proof?

510
00:58:48,188 --> 00:58:49,249
Threaten him

511
00:58:49,896 --> 00:58:53,668
We can't overdo it

512
00:58:57,858 --> 00:58:59,811
I'll give you this

513
00:59:06,977 --> 00:59:11,776
This is the latest weapon made in the laboratory.
Use this just in case

514
00:59:12,456 --> 00:59:13,349
Thanks

515
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,911
Hello?
From  Mrs.Asai

516
00:59:27,587 --> 00:59:29,652
Hello?

517
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,431
What?
Cat's eye?

518
00:59:32,732 --> 00:59:34,931
I found out

519
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:38,391
I found it at the British Embassy

520
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:41,984
I'm sure

521
00:59:42,163 --> 00:59:46,415
So I thought I'd let you know first

522
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:50,165
I want to see you tonight

523
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,328
Who is cat's eye?

524
00:59:55,556 --> 00:59:57,453
I want to see you tonight

525
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:01,299
I tell you

526
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:04,124
Don't be surprised

527
01:00:04,939 --> 01:00:06,724
cat's eye is

528
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:17,827
Hello?
Madam?

529
01:00:20,193 --> 01:00:22,347
Hello?
Madam?

530
01:00:25,244 --> 01:00:26,762
Hello?
Madam?

531
01:00:29,072 --> 01:00:34,887
Asai, who knows the true identity of Cat's Eye, was killed by someone

532
01:00:35,411 --> 01:00:38,871
Two days to the deadline

533
01:00:39,451 --> 01:00:46,271
I was in trouble but Misuzu contacted me in sudden

534
01:00:47,052 --> 01:00:51,070
I copied this.
I read out loud

535
01:00:52,588 --> 01:00:54,775
May 11, 1945

536
01:00:55,634 --> 01:01:00,489
Britain will enter the war in earnest

537
01:01:01,728 --> 01:01:06,918
I am interested in Churchill's strategy

538
01:01:07,811 --> 01:01:09,998
I remembered something strange today

539
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:17,469
He looks just like the person who had a secret conversation with the Prime Minister in London

540
01:01:18,876 --> 01:01:23,909
I still don't know if he is the same person

541
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:30,628
I don't know any more details

542
01:01:31,264 --> 01:01:32,302
Thank you

543
01:01:37,406 --> 01:01:41,714
Listen directly from your dad

544
01:01:42,362 --> 01:01:43,913
Can I see him?

545
01:01:44,616 --> 01:01:46,190
I try

546
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:55,149
Who's the hell you are?

547
01:01:55,551 --> 01:01:58,118
By order you die

548
01:02:05,674 --> 01:02:06,567
Dad

549
01:02:07,672 --> 01:02:08,665
Dad

550
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:12,504
Shape up!

551
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:18,586
Takakura-san

552
01:02:18,921 --> 01:02:19,758
Dad!

553
01:02:20,975 --> 01:02:22,627
Takakura-san, please tell me

554
01:02:23,653 --> 01:02:27,292
Who are the spies I met in the English palace?

555
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:30,082
Takakura-san, please tell me

556
01:02:37,327 --> 01:02:38,398
He died

557
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:41,166
Dad!

558
01:02:42,751 --> 01:02:43,934
Dad!

559
01:02:55,509 --> 01:02:57,886
I'm sorry,Misuzu

560
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:04,024
I asked him a question before he died

561
01:03:06,011 --> 01:03:08,477
I am a very terrible man

562
01:03:10,531 --> 01:03:15,877
I lost the last clue about catch eyes

563
01:03:17,183 --> 01:03:24,181
I couldn't stay in her sentiment

564
01:03:25,375 --> 01:03:29,091
Two days to the deadline

565
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:34,292
After leaving Takakura-san's house, I headed to Tokyo

566
01:03:56,168 --> 01:04:00,130
I noticed that an Austin's car was running

567
01:04:01,413 --> 01:04:05,978
Same as the car in front of the apartment

568
01:04:07,551 --> 01:04:12,640
The driver looks just like Koyanagi

569
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,926
I've decided to chase him

570
01:04:31,955 --> 01:04:35,237
The car was running along the coastline

571
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:39,667
I noticed something strange

572
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:46,107
The windshield wiper started to move even though it wasn't raining

573
01:04:46,911 --> 01:04:51,096
This was in front of the U.S. military shooting range

574
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:20,716
Hi

575
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:22,624
Wait a min

576
01:05:23,048 --> 01:05:25,537
I'm in hurry

577
01:05:36,312 --> 01:05:39,325
Where he's gone?

578
01:05:58,270 --> 01:05:59,810
Keep the change

579
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:12,047
Thank you

580
01:06:46,499 --> 01:06:48,754
He didn't notice at all

581
01:06:49,848 --> 01:06:56,321
He drove towards the Miura Peninsula

582
01:08:51,406 --> 01:08:56,953
As I suspected, the wipers were rigged with 8 mm filming devices.

583
01:09:15,737 --> 01:09:21,708
Do you remember me?

584
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:24,632
Don't pretend you don't know

585
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:28,504
I know you are not Japanese

586
01:09:29,107 --> 01:09:32,522
Who do you work for?

587
01:09:47,013 --> 01:09:48,051
Do it

588
01:09:54,647 --> 01:09:59,234
Hey,Look at this

589
01:10:03,623 --> 01:10:04,795
Stop it!

590
01:10:12,597 --> 01:10:13,914
Who do you work for?

591
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:15,677
England

592
01:10:16,369 --> 01:10:18,992
Did you get an order from Cat's Eye?

593
01:10:29,522 --> 01:10:31,073
Stop it!

594
01:10:33,489 --> 01:10:34,348
Cat's Eye is

595
01:10:35,643 --> 01:10:36,848
Who is Cat's Eye?

596
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,739
Say it!

597
01:10:41,301 --> 01:10:45,809
I don't know because I only get paid from a reporter

598
01:10:46,792 --> 01:10:47,663
Who's the reporter?

599
01:10:48,265 --> 01:10:49,426
Say it!

600
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:52,261
That coffee shop master

601
01:10:53,042 --> 01:10:55,241
That coffee shop master is involved

602
01:11:12,914 --> 01:11:14,130
Welcome

603
01:11:14,155 --> 01:11:17,099
I brought the person I introduced to you

604
01:11:30,363 --> 01:11:32,584
I'm Fung Yung Ming

605
01:11:32,609 --> 01:11:33,957
He's Chinese?

606
01:11:33,982 --> 01:11:39,504
He is my senior and graduated from Chongqing school

607
01:11:39,883 --> 01:11:40,932
From Chongqing ?

608
01:11:41,624 --> 01:11:44,202
I was ordered to do a Cat's Eye job

609
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:45,955
Oh I see

610
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,763
Take it

611
01:11:58,823 --> 01:12:04,838
This man is a Japanese spy

612
01:12:08,666 --> 01:12:11,211
Please introduce me to Cat's Eye

613
01:12:11,747 --> 01:12:16,100
I just know their phone number

614
01:12:16,535 --> 01:12:19,660
But I can't tell you it

615
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:21,569
I see

616
01:12:24,281 --> 01:12:26,278
I will contact them for the time being

617
01:12:59,377 --> 01:13:03,462
Cat's Eye wants you to do one job

618
01:13:04,281 --> 01:13:07,919
If it succeeds they will meet you

619
01:13:08,745 --> 01:13:10,754
This is a very difficult job

620
01:13:10,966 --> 01:13:12,384
Let me do it

621
01:13:13,571 --> 01:13:17,065
This is the British Government Code book

622
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:22,243
Take this you visit the German embassy

623
01:13:25,044 --> 01:13:28,817
They buy this book for money

624
01:13:30,469 --> 01:13:31,562
Is this real?

625
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:33,225
Of course

626
01:13:33,772 --> 01:13:37,712
However, this alone cannot break the code.

627
01:13:38,978 --> 01:13:42,181
You get the trust of them

628
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:50,585
You search for spy organizations at the German embassy

629
01:13:53,896 --> 01:13:55,213
This is a difficult job

630
01:14:06,747 --> 01:14:09,258
Go to German embassy

631
01:14:32,152 --> 01:14:32,877
Have a seat

632
01:14:35,746 --> 01:14:39,975
You want me to buy something

633
01:14:45,118 --> 01:14:47,730
This is one of the UK's secret documents

634
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,911
How much do you buy?

635
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:53,846
Is this real?

636
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,163
Of course

637
01:14:56,409 --> 01:14:59,132
How did you get it?

638
01:15:00,259 --> 01:15:01,565
I can't tell

639
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,860
Saimsa,right?

640
01:15:04,619 --> 01:15:05,334
Saimusa?

641
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:09,854
He is a British spy

642
01:15:12,958 --> 01:15:14,554
You are also a British spy, right?

643
01:15:14,956 --> 01:15:16,418
I'm not

644
01:15:16,741 --> 01:15:18,360
Why do you think so?

645
01:15:19,453 --> 01:15:21,172
Don't pretend you don't know

646
01:15:22,835 --> 01:15:26,697
I know you went to his shop

647
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:31,730
Our intelligence agency is investigating it

648
01:15:33,296 --> 01:15:36,711
Hands up!
I arrest you

649
01:15:38,798 --> 01:15:40,807
Hands up!

650
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:52,752
Don't get me wrong.
I went to his shop tonight but

651
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:55,140
But I came to investigate them

652
01:15:55,274 --> 01:16:04,426
Don't lie. You came to investigate the intelligence department of the German embassy at the request of him

653
01:16:05,928 --> 01:16:06,933
I know that

654
01:16:08,339 --> 01:16:15,969
I can't think of anything other than Saimusa reported him

655
01:16:17,052 --> 01:16:19,909
He and this guy are related

656
01:16:21,349 --> 01:16:24,630
I finally figure out

657
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:31,985
Can't see the forest for the trees.
You are cat's eye

658
01:16:34,442 --> 01:16:42,389
If you wear German military uniform and have the German flag on, you don't look like a British spy.

659
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:48,664
This guy is a British spy.
Arrest him

660
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:52,759
This guy is the British Spy Cat's Eye

661
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:55,037
Bring him out

662
01:17:21,286 --> 01:17:23,507
Where do you take me?

663
01:17:30,717 --> 01:17:33,161
Let's go to that river

664
01:17:33,853 --> 01:17:41,040
I remembered Kubota being killed in Tama-river

665
01:17:49,139 --> 01:17:50,278
Shiina-san!

666
01:19:11,423 --> 01:19:13,711
I wanna smoke?

667
01:19:13,845 --> 01:19:15,062
Smoke?

668
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:17,160
It's in my pocket

669
01:20:09,719 --> 01:20:11,483
Are you Ok?

670
01:20:45,406 --> 01:20:47,739
I need a car

671
01:21:22,287 --> 01:21:26,807
Please accompany us.
We have the approval of the German Chancellor

672
01:21:33,314 --> 01:21:36,160
I'm not an ambassador's subordinate

673
01:21:37,968 --> 01:21:45,100
You can't restrain me

674
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:40,468
We have to contact headquarters

675
01:23:07,801 --> 01:23:10,111
Hey, it's me.
Open it!

676
01:23:10,647 --> 01:23:11,818
Cat's eye!
Stay!

677
01:23:33,724 --> 01:23:34,829
Watch out!

678
01:24:08,366 --> 01:24:10,476
This man is under arrest for espionage!
Don't come closer!

679
01:25:24,925 --> 01:25:27,191
I am here on behalf of Jiro Shiina

680
01:25:27,905 --> 01:25:30,449
I feel sorry

681
01:25:32,882 --> 01:25:34,646
Thank you for coming

682
01:25:37,269 --> 01:25:39,735
I kept this for you from him.

683
01:25:46,978 --> 01:25:52,681
I wrote to her with all my heart.

684
01:25:53,809 --> 01:26:03,239
I have great respect for Mr. Takakura, and I think Japan has lost a very important person.

685
01:26:05,393 --> 01:26:08,117
I am very grateful to her

686
01:26:11,242 --> 01:26:16,431
I wanted her to know the real me.

687
01:26:23,147 --> 01:26:25,792
I will never see her again

688
01:26:27,108 --> 01:26:34,999
As Mr. Takakura feared, Japan has gone down the road to radical war.

689
01:26:35,835 --> 01:26:42,643
I followed the trend and hurried to my next destination.

690
01:26:51,654 --> 01:26:57,301
THE END

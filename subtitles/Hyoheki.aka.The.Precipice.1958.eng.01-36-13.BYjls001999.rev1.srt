<i>Hyoheki / The Precipice (1958)</i>

3
00:01:37,584 --> 00:01:38,410
Welcome.

4
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:40,510
Welcome.

5
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:42,224
Were you going to the mountain again?

6
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:47,778
I went up to the top of the Gofuku mountain.

7
00:01:47,803 --> 00:01:49,271
Not many people there anymore?

8
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:50,651
There were only two groups.

9
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:53,950
I came straight from the mountains.
I want to eat something tasty.

10
00:01:53,987 --> 00:01:54,702
How about salmon egg?

11
00:01:54,727 --> 00:01:55,329
That's good.

12
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,522
Welcome.
Were you going to the mountain again?

13
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:04,588
Mr. Kosaka was here a while ago.

14
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:08,070
Yes, unusually, he didn't drink, but ate dinner and left.

15
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,082
I see.

16
00:02:10,828 --> 00:02:11,962
I wanted to see him.

17
00:02:12,148 --> 00:02:14,728
He said he was meeting someone on the second floor of TOKIWA Kaikan.

18
00:02:14,963 --> 00:02:16,543
I guess he is still there.

19
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,276
May be.

20
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,684
Hey.

21
00:02:42,339 --> 00:02:43,432
Oh you.

22
00:02:44,036 --> 00:02:45,623
Is there such a greeting?

23
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:46,890
I'm waiting for someone here.

24
00:02:47,789 --> 00:02:48,562
Where'd you go?

25
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:49,586
Mt.Godaka.

26
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:50,746
Alone?

27
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,133
Who are you waiting for?

28
00:02:53,985 --> 00:02:56,778
You look like you've been waiting a long time.

29
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:03,682
Sorry to keep you waiting.

30
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,962
This is Mr. Uozu, my friend from the mountains.

31
00:03:08,176 --> 00:03:09,243
I'm Yashiro.

32
00:03:09,343 --> 00:03:10,049
Have a seat.

33
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:14,310
I'm so sorry I called you here.

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,483
No, it's fine.

35
00:03:15,936 --> 00:03:17,463
What's so urgent?

36
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,242
I have something for you.

37
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:19,895
What is it?

38
00:03:21,183 --> 00:03:22,723
I'll give it to you later.

39
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:26,968
He's my mountain buddy from school.
Don't worry about him.

40
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,020
Look at this.

41
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:36,899
What's this?

42
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,921
You'll be home, and then you'll open it.

43
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:42,718
I have to go.

44
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:45,824
Why don't you have a cup of tea?

45
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:46,705
I have to go.

46
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:47,748
I'm tired.

47
00:03:47,968 --> 00:03:49,775
I have to go.

48
00:03:50,037 --> 00:03:50,923
Sit down.

49
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:52,847
You can stay here for five or ten minutes.

50
00:03:53,335 --> 00:03:55,515
I just came by to take a look at your face.

51
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:57,515
See you.

52
00:04:06,147 --> 00:04:06,813
Uozu.

53
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:11,664
I finally caught up with you.
Where are you headed back to?

54
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:12,344
Omori.

55
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:20,387
I am in Denenchofu.
We're going in the same direction, and if it's not too much trouble, I'd be happy to walk you home with you.

56
00:04:20,465 --> 00:04:21,805
Where's Kosaka?

57
00:04:22,982 --> 00:04:25,602
I just left him there.

58
00:04:26,738 --> 00:04:31,392
Actually, there's something I'd like to discuss with you.

59
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:39,508
I didn't have any intention of doing so before I saw you.

60
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,379
I suddenly had that feeling.

61
00:04:44,434 --> 00:04:45,187
Taxi.

62
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:47,747
Go to Denenchofu.

63
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:49,454
Thanks.

64
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,567
Please.

65
00:05:03,566 --> 00:05:07,279
Did you hear something about me and Mr. Kosaka?

66
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:08,332
No.

67
00:05:13,687 --> 00:05:17,927
I just returned a letter to Mr. Kosaka.

68
00:05:19,697 --> 00:05:22,483
It was given to me by Mr. Kosaka over the past two years.

69
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:32,290
I appreciate his kindness, but I'm in trouble.

70
00:05:33,154 --> 00:05:34,347
I'm married.

71
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:55,224
How long have you known Kosaka?

72
00:05:55,698 --> 00:05:57,844
About four years now.

73
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:03,198
This was before I married into the Yashiro family.
We didn't see each other for a while after I got married.

74
00:06:03,925 --> 00:06:09,732
We met by chance at Christmas the year before last.
Then we met again.

75
00:06:10,468 --> 00:06:11,702
How do you say Kosaka?

76
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:15,405
He asked me to divorce and be with him.

77
00:06:16,732 --> 00:06:17,612
And you?

78
00:06:19,016 --> 00:06:20,123
I'm in trouble.

79
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:30,610
I have a favor to ask.
I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Kosaka.

80
00:06:31,286 --> 00:06:36,353
Yes, I will.
If you're right, Kosaka's attitude is insane.

81
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,528
Isn't that right?

82
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:43,586
Is there anything about your relationship that you haven't told me?

83
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,786
For example, you really like Kosaka or something.

84
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,545
No.

85
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:48,413
But.

86
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,399
But?

87
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:52,106
I think Kosaka may have misunderstood me.

88
00:06:52,862 --> 00:06:55,522
Like I said I have affection for him.

89
00:06:55,595 --> 00:06:59,088
Why?
Haven't you clearly stated your feelings?

90
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:01,107
I have told him many times.

91
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,147
Then he knows exactly how you feel.

92
00:07:08,056 --> 00:07:10,169
I don't know what it is about you two.

93
00:07:12,084 --> 00:07:15,810
It's not love, of course.

94
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:27,861
I had sexual relations with Kosaka once.

95
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:35,665
It was foolish of me, and I made a terrible mistake.

96
00:07:36,284 --> 00:07:39,064
That's why I can't say no strongly enough.

97
00:07:39,317 --> 00:07:40,470
Excuse me.

98
00:08:18,806 --> 00:08:19,539
Good morning.

99
00:08:25,008 --> 00:08:26,314
When did you get home? This morning?

100
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:27,442
No, last night.

101
00:08:32,364 --> 00:08:36,237
Why do I climb mountains?
Because the mountains are there.

102
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:44,702
Climbing the mountain
Step by step we climb higher and higher. You carry heavy things on our backs.

103
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:46,369
That's a lot of work.

104
00:08:48,298 --> 00:08:54,424
It's not a lot of money from this tiny company.
You spend most of your monthly salary on the mountains.

105
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:56,586
That's great.

106
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:03,314
In his hometown, his aging parents want to get a wife for their college-educated son.

107
00:09:04,384 --> 00:09:09,391
But their son is too lazy to get a wife
He climbs mountains in his spare time

108
00:09:10,422 --> 00:09:12,176
He spends all his time in the mountains

109
00:09:14,448 --> 00:09:17,988
Unlike you, we like to climb down from high places step by step

110
00:09:18,698 --> 00:09:21,291
On the other hand, every time I move my feet, I lower myself that much lower.

111
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:25,416
The stable part comes down from the unstable part.
This is at least more natural.

112
00:09:25,546 --> 00:09:27,626
it's because of your age.

113
00:09:28,073 --> 00:09:28,626
My age?

114
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:31,041
Don't joke about that, boy.

115
00:09:31,423 --> 00:09:35,476
You mean, When you're young you want to climb high.
When you're old, you want to climb down?

116
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,420
That's not the point.

117
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:40,931
It's whether you like it or not.

118
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:45,644
I don't understand how you can avoid step by step from human beings and climb up to the heights.

119
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,105
Osaka headquarters is on the phone, sir.

120
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,047
Why you told me earlier?

121
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,267
You mentioned it with too much enthusiasm.

122
00:09:54,585 --> 00:09:55,398
Yamada.

123
00:09:58,108 --> 00:10:00,982
Put this and this in tomorrow's ad.

124
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:09,215
I appreciate the order from headquarters, but from the standpoint of the Tokyo office...
We can't just accept an order from an executive without questioning it.

125
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,711
Hello,
ToKo publisher?

126
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:18,701
Is Kosaka there?

127
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:22,728
Uozu?
What's wrong?

128
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,488
I need to see you for a minute right now.

129
00:10:25,513 --> 00:10:28,062
I'll take my side.
I'll be out in half an hour.

130
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:29,799
Wait for me out front.

131
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,084
What do you want to talk about?

132
00:10:42,858 --> 00:10:44,964
I ran into Mrs. Yashiro after I left you last night.

133
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,606
I took a cab to her house.

134
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,310
Thanks.

135
00:10:50,502 --> 00:10:52,382
That's when she asked me to do something for you.

136
00:10:52,655 --> 00:10:53,775
I thought it would be something like that.

137
00:10:56,003 --> 00:11:04,230
At that time, she was in a hurry to get home, so I thought maybe she was chasing you.

138
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:08,242
What she said?

139
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,526
I'll tell you exactly what I heard.
In short, she wants to break things off with you.

140
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,784
No I can't.

141
00:11:22,284 --> 00:11:23,031
Why?

142
00:11:24,617 --> 00:11:28,537
I think just having some sort of connection with that lady is what keeps me alive.

143
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,813
I can't imagine myself no longer having any relationship with that person.

144
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:36,272
I wonder if I won't be able to survive?

145
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,345
Don't scare me.

146
00:11:37,492 --> 00:11:38,159
No, it's true

147
00:11:38,822 --> 00:11:43,282
But she is someone's wife
I think your way of thinking doesn't make sense.

148
00:11:44,523 --> 00:11:45,843
I've been out of line from the beginning.

149
00:11:45,903 --> 00:11:46,903
It's a mess.

150
00:11:46,928 --> 00:11:47,476
It's true.

151
00:11:49,786 --> 00:11:51,799
I don't like that you agree with me so honestly.

152
00:11:53,871 --> 00:11:57,417
But is that what love is all about?

153
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,412
She only cares about the world.

154
00:12:01,136 --> 00:12:03,236
She's letting her feelings show.

155
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,614
She didn't say that.
She said you misunderstood her.

156
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:09,647
Misunderstood?

157
00:12:12,015 --> 00:12:15,395
Well, the way I see it, she doesn't....

158
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,535
she doesn't....love me?

159
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:17,955
No.

160
00:12:22,014 --> 00:12:22,921
I knew it.

161
00:12:25,794 --> 00:12:26,581
I knew it.

162
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,108
But it's a lie.

163
00:12:31,302 --> 00:12:32,862
How do you know it's a lie?

164
00:12:34,501 --> 00:12:35,735
Whose side are you on, anyway?

165
00:12:36,388 --> 00:12:37,574
I'm not taking sides.

166
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:40,228
You're just trying to keep me away from Mrs. Yashiro.

167
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:41,991
I would if I could.

168
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,126
You love her too?

169
00:12:57,963 --> 00:12:58,743
Sorry.

170
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:01,450
That was a gaffe.

171
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,418
I'm excited.

172
00:13:13,817 --> 00:13:19,157
She once told me outright with her mouth that she loved me.

173
00:13:20,657 --> 00:13:21,650
On Christmas Eve.

174
00:13:23,785 --> 00:13:28,598
What kind of a woman says she loves me if she doesn't love me?

175
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:38,865
How is it possible that love can so easily disappear without a trace in the heart of a single person?

176
00:13:40,337 --> 00:13:44,671
But she has no intention of leaving her husband at the moment.

177
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:46,943
I don't think so.

178
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:55,948
She's married to an old man thirty years older than she.

179
00:14:01,646 --> 00:14:05,306
They live a loveless life in the name of matrimony.

180
00:14:12,217 --> 00:14:12,950
I got it.

181
00:14:15,237 --> 00:14:15,977
From her?

182
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:07,333
Good morning.

183
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:08,286
Good morning.

184
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,026
I'll leave the tea here for you.

185
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,279
I wanted tomato juice.

186
00:15:13,873 --> 00:15:14,906
Oh, you don't like tea?

187
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:15,872
It's ok.

188
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:18,296
Okay, I'll bring you some tomato juice.

189
00:15:18,363 --> 00:15:20,363
Tea's fine.
You're making meal, right?

190
00:15:21,282 --> 00:15:23,002
It will still take 10 minutes.

191
00:15:24,781 --> 00:15:26,341
This tea smells a little like leeks.

192
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:28,048
Does it smell?

193
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:29,676
This tea smells a little like leeks.

194
00:15:30,036 --> 00:15:31,496
Well, I'll go change it.

195
00:15:31,521 --> 00:15:32,170
It's ok.

196
00:15:33,202 --> 00:15:35,215
You probably have the smell of leeks on your fingers.

197
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:36,372
Did you see it?

198
00:15:36,823 --> 00:15:37,370
For what?

199
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,415
No, it's okay.

200
00:15:39,762 --> 00:15:40,929
I'll be home late tonight.

201
00:15:41,593 --> 00:15:42,079
What's up?

202
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,552
I have a nuclear work study meeting.

203
00:15:55,066 --> 00:15:56,172
See you.

204
00:16:23,003 --> 00:16:24,236
From your house.

205
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,629
It's me.
What's wrong?

206
00:16:30,894 --> 00:16:32,534
Stop working.

207
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:33,534
OK.

208
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:35,287
What's wrong?

209
00:16:35,341 --> 00:16:36,467
I was getting worried.

210
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:37,447
About what?

211
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:41,735
You knew I pinched a tea pole with my finger this morning, didn't you?

212
00:16:43,928 --> 00:16:46,188
If you saw me, you should have reprimanded me.

213
00:16:46,225 --> 00:16:48,119
I don't like the way you say that.

214
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:49,432
It smells a little like leeks.

215
00:16:49,811 --> 00:16:52,645
That's fine.
You didn't mean to be bad.

216
00:16:53,384 --> 00:16:58,550
You were trying to get the tea pole.
That's why your fingertip touched it a little.

217
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:01,388
Well, it can't be helped, can it?

218
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:02,215
You think so?

219
00:17:02,628 --> 00:17:04,768
I don't see any malice in it.

220
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:07,448
I don't think there's anything to be blamed for.

221
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,659
I'll hang up.

222
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:10,716
There's nothing else that you don't like.

223
00:17:11,235 --> 00:17:11,775
About what?

224
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,499
Besides the tea pole.

225
00:17:13,765 --> 00:17:14,839
Besides the tea pole?

226
00:17:16,563 --> 00:17:19,023
What do you mean?
I'll hang up.

227
00:17:43,498 --> 00:17:44,558
This is Yashiro.

228
00:17:46,157 --> 00:17:48,077
Hello, this is Uozu.
Thank you for the other day.

229
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,176
May I visit you with Kosaka now?

230
00:17:54,545 --> 00:17:55,245
You two?

231
00:17:58,102 --> 00:18:02,102
Kosaka wants to see you one last time.
We've discussed many things.

232
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,230
I'm sure he won't do anything to offend you.

233
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:09,342
If it's convenient for you, why don't you come down to the station?

234
00:18:09,709 --> 00:18:11,089
It would be better at my house.

235
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:30,266
Welcome.

236
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:31,966
Come in.

237
00:18:37,022 --> 00:18:40,449
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you, but I've made up my mind.

238
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:47,249
I came here today because I didn't want to leave without seeing you.

239
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:48,854
I’m sorry.

240
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:51,312
You're not the only one who's sorry.

241
00:18:52,092 --> 00:18:54,632
I'm sorry, too.

242
00:18:56,489 --> 00:19:00,442
Don't say sorry.
We will be miserable.

243
00:19:02,483 --> 00:19:03,783
I just need you to do one thing for me.

244
00:19:03,883 --> 00:19:05,310
You promised not to say anything.

245
00:19:05,725 --> 00:19:06,432
Don't worry.

246
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:11,439
Are your feelings really as you described them to Uozu?

247
00:19:12,994 --> 00:19:16,880
I wonder if you have a little bit of love for me.

248
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:25,328
I hate to say this, but...
I think I was affectionate that night.

249
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:26,782
But at other times...

250
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:28,096
You say you don't have it?

251
00:19:30,944 --> 00:19:37,757
But if that's the case, then we can't trust the human heart too much, can we?

252
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,891
You said yourself... that you loved me.

253
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:43,677
Stop it....

254
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,686
I honestly believed it!

255
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:49,922
We talked so much last night, and you agreed with me.

256
00:19:54,877 --> 00:20:01,863
I mean, you're not even related to me as a person.
I just know that you want to be a person who passes by me on the road.

257
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,812
Uozu, I'm going home first.

258
00:20:04,925 --> 00:20:05,639
No, I'm leaving too.

259
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,665
I want to go home alone.

260
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:10,070
Kosaka

261
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:33,954
Regardless of Kosaka's attitude
What he said sounds reasonable.

262
00:20:34,969 --> 00:20:38,063
As he says, there is a lie on your part.

263
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:45,421
I have told you my shame.
I will tell you anything you want to know.

264
00:20:47,877 --> 00:20:49,957
I have not lied to him.

265
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:55,774
I made a mistake... at night... but I think I was in love with him.

266
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,899
My husband was in Kansai for a month.

267
00:21:01,289 --> 00:21:05,436
We ate at a restaurant in Ginza and walked around the city on Christmas Eve.

268
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:08,371
I was the one who told him I wanted to have a drink.

269
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,299
When he asked me out at the hotel, I didn't refuse.

270
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:16,220
But on the way home, I was so miserable I wanted to cry.

271
00:21:17,077 --> 00:21:18,897
I had only loved him for a short time.

272
00:21:20,724 --> 00:21:22,857
I knew I would regret it later.

273
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:27,467
I knew I would be accused of being a married woman.

274
00:21:28,681 --> 00:21:33,054
But I wanted him.

275
00:21:34,235 --> 00:21:38,822
Ma'am...
Let's put this matter to rest.

276
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:45,412
Kosaka may suffer for the time being.
But time will tell.

277
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:51,387
Besides, we're going to the mountains at the end of this year to climb the Mt.Hodaka

278
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:56,571
Climbing that wall for the first time in years will calm Kosaka's mind.

279
00:21:58,867 --> 00:22:01,954
I'll make you some tea.

280
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:03,033
Excuse me.

281
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:06,921
I think Kosaka's walking without taking the train.

282
00:22:07,266 --> 00:22:09,579
I feel sorry for him if he's drinking tea here.

283
00:22:10,014 --> 00:22:10,734
On foot?

284
00:22:11,334 --> 00:22:12,041
Yes.

285
00:22:12,894 --> 00:22:14,321
He'll walk home.

286
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:15,247
He'll walk home.

287
00:22:15,777 --> 00:22:20,004
We don't mind walking for two or three hours.
We walked in the mountains when We were a student.

288
00:22:21,698 --> 00:22:25,051
I think he's walking more and more now.

289
00:22:35,565 --> 00:22:36,945
Where's he gone?

290
00:22:55,151 --> 00:22:59,911

If it stops snowing, we'll get up at 3:30 and leave at 5:00.

316
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,227
Hey, wake up.
The stars are out.

317
00:27:06,888 --> 00:27:07,822
That's a lot of stars.

318
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,237
I make zoni every year.

319
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:21,923
I don't know how it happened, but I've been eating only your zoni for five years.

320
00:27:25,479 --> 00:27:26,266
It's New Year's.

00:27:45,406 --> 00:27:47,686
I think it's 8:00 a.m. for the north wall.

324
00:27:48,407 --> 00:27:52,374
The north wall.
I wish Minako Yashiro could've seen that wall.

325
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:53,882
Kosaka.

326
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:58,857
Don't worry... my feelings are under control.

327
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:02,517
Tea in the thermos.

328
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:13,339
Crackers, cheese, chocolate, dried grapes
Pack yokan jelly and other food in each of our sacks

329
00:28:14,831 --> 00:28:24,036
Check and pack the rope, harten, carabiners, hammers, and a stubby rucksack.

330
00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:27,725
This is the first time to use nylon rope.

331
00:28:42,874 --> 00:28:44,581
Departure at 5:30am.

332
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:50,362
Climbing this 150-meter rock wall

333
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,269
The snow-covered rock wall is challenging us from the other side.

334
00:28:59,841 --> 00:29:04,941
8:00 a.m., drink a cup of tea from the mouth of a thermos and put on the rope

335
00:29:23,546 --> 00:29:24,279
Here we go.

336
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,853
It was the first time to use a 30-meter-long nylon rope.

337
00:31:47,303 --> 00:31:52,563
3:00 After climbing up the North wall, we finally reach the second terrace.

338
00:31:53,317 --> 00:31:54,717
It took 7 hours.

339
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:59,663
3:30 a.m.: Climbing the A face.

340
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:02,828
The wind picked up and it was blizzarding.

341
00:32:03,632 --> 00:32:04,619
Climbing is impossible.

342
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:06,294
We decided to rebark.

343
00:32:07,188 --> 00:32:10,555
Blowing from the front of the blizzard
It's cold and blustery.

344
00:32:11,172 --> 00:32:12,459
We were so tired.

345
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,769
We're in trouble.

346
00:32:18,449 --> 00:32:20,256
It's only 30 meters.

347
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,240
Don't sleep.

348
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:31,751
I'm not sleeping.
I've been thinking...

349
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:32,248
For what?

350
00:32:32,861 --> 00:32:34,468
Why do we climb mountains?

351
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:35,702
Because we like it.

352
00:32:37,209 --> 00:32:39,609
But I don't.

353
00:32:41,307 --> 00:32:43,221
Because I want to escape from the human world.

354
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:49,160
I risk my life to climb the walls because I want to forget the pain of reality.

355
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,857
I'm a weak man after all.
I guess I'm weak-minded.

356
00:33:03,211 --> 00:33:03,931
2am.

357
00:33:05,977 --> 00:33:08,877
I think the climbers feel the same way I do.

358
00:33:09,537 --> 00:33:14,038
Sometimes you come to the mountains to forget something, don't you?

359
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:15,965
It could be.

360
00:33:21,391 --> 00:33:22,685
It's 7:30.
Let's do it.

361
00:33:23,091 --> 00:33:26,331
Three hours of fighting, and we'll be on top of the mountain.

362
00:33:27,122 --> 00:33:28,942
I'll take the lead this time.

363
00:33:39,372 --> 00:33:40,146
Let's go!

364
00:34:08,807 --> 00:34:09,927
Let's have a rest.

365
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:33,683
Let's go!

366
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:51,152
Kosaka!

367
00:35:52,092 --> 00:35:53,525
Kosaka!

368
00:36:10,121 --> 00:36:12,421
Kosaka!

369
00:36:35,324 --> 00:36:38,217
What is your relationship with Kosaka?

370
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:40,301
What do you mean?

371
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:42,029
Never mind.

372
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,595
Something happened?

373
00:36:59,495 --> 00:37:01,662
Do you have any cream puffs?

374
00:37:02,797 --> 00:37:04,243
Sorry we don't have.

375
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,427
I ate all last night.

376
00:37:07,842 --> 00:37:08,562
How about fruits?

377
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,639
Apple?

378
00:37:10,423 --> 00:37:11,243
I'll have it.

379
00:37:17,271 --> 00:37:18,571
You look unhappy.

380
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:20,685
I'll do it.

381
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:10,437
Are you Mr. Kosaka's sister?

382
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:11,430
Yes.

383
00:38:12,479 --> 00:38:13,612
I am Yashiro.

384
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:16,953
Oh Yashiro.

385
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,812
Please come in.

386
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:29,560
Are you going to the mountains?

387
00:38:29,886 --> 00:38:35,152
Yes, I have a colleague who is going to the site, and I'm going with him.

388
00:38:35,534 --> 00:38:37,481
What time will you leave?

389
00:38:37,696 --> 00:38:39,876
The 12:25 train.

390
00:38:40,643 --> 00:38:42,343
Then you don't have much time left.

391
00:38:42,861 --> 00:38:44,841
But please, have some tea.

392
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,796
This is my brother's room.

393
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:59,862
I don't know how he got into trouble.
I am sure he thought of you in his last moments.

394
00:39:07,647 --> 00:39:10,154
This is one of his favorite pictures.

395
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:12,964
I'd be happy to take it home with you.

396
00:39:13,536 --> 00:39:13,916
But.

397
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:15,463
Don't worry.

398
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,467
I'll take this.

399
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:24,803
This is not good.

400
00:39:26,923 --> 00:39:27,637
Why?

401
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,443
Because Mr. Uozu is here.

402
00:39:57,014 --> 00:39:59,054
Uozu,
You have to sleep.

403
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:17,771
Kosaka,
You loved this fire.

404
00:40:24,677 --> 00:40:31,023
One day or another, if I die in the mountains.

405
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:37,768
I will leave this note for you, my old mountain friend

406
00:40:40,114 --> 00:40:41,961
Please see my mother.

407
00:40:43,536 --> 00:40:44,716
Then tell her.

408
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,346
I died happy.

409
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:57,593
Tell my dad I didn't suffer a bit because I was there for my mom.

410
00:40:59,287 --> 00:41:03,954
Tell my brother I was a man.

411
00:41:05,315 --> 00:41:08,068
Now pass the baton to you.

412
00:41:12,647 --> 00:41:14,727
I couldn't find him.
It was too snow.

413
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:19,166
It's probably stuck in the snow.

414
00:41:25,417 --> 00:41:30,117
If we search any further, we risk an avalanche.

415
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:40,665
I'll stay here until spring.
So don't worry.

416
00:41:41,437 --> 00:41:45,337
You'd better get off the mountain and comfort Mr. Kosaka's bereaved family members.

417
00:41:48,387 --> 00:41:49,273
Did you find Kosaka's body?

418
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:51,473
We are co-worker of his from Tokyo.

419
00:42:23,189 --> 00:42:23,829
Kosaka.

420
00:42:26,063 --> 00:42:27,969
I'll be back soon.

421
00:42:57,512 --> 00:42:59,305
This is the last stop

422
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,221
Forgive me.

423
00:43:50,108 --> 00:43:53,414
He changed the top to cover for me when I was tired.

424
00:43:57,545 --> 00:44:00,658
We were only 10 meters from the finish line.

425
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,139
Let me cry just now.
I will never cry again.

426
00:44:42,451 --> 00:44:43,804
The rope was cut.

427
00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:45,897
I know that.

428
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,408
Are you Uozu?

429
00:44:59,095 --> 00:45:00,435
The rope was cut?

430
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:04,152
Did the nylon rope break?

431
00:45:04,278 --> 00:45:06,085
That's a lifeline.

432
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,920
Did something go wrong for you?

433
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:09,668
Tell us about the detail.

434
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:16,204
Let's hear what veterans of the mountaineering community have to say about nylon ropes

435
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:18,923
First, Mr. Ichiro Jukuyama, a lineage sports equipment dealer, says

436
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:26,056
Nylon rope is stronger than ordinary Asa rope and will never break.

437
00:45:26,230 --> 00:45:28,544
It is used by climbers all over the world today.

438
00:45:29,853 --> 00:45:32,913
Also, Mr. Yoshihiko Takekoshi, editor-in-chief of Asahi Shobo says.

439
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:40,661
The nylon rope is supposed to be unbreakable.
I think there must have been a technical failure somewhere.

440
00:45:46,015 --> 00:45:46,648
Good morning.

441
00:45:59,525 --> 00:46:00,578
You must be terribly tired.

442
00:46:02,918 --> 00:46:06,272
I left my friend up in the mountains.
That's what's killing me.

443
00:46:12,279 --> 00:46:13,759
Winter in the mountains can be scary.

444
00:46:14,985 --> 00:46:17,845
But you went out there knowing you'd be scared, so there's nothing you can do about it.

445
00:46:18,919 --> 00:46:23,979
I'm sorry about your friend.
It just so happens that your friend got the bad end of the stick, not you.

446
00:46:24,705 --> 00:46:27,058
Or maybe both of you would have been died together.

447
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:30,784
It would be nice you're happy to be home alone.

448
00:46:33,153 --> 00:46:34,160
The rope was broken?

449
00:46:34,933 --> 00:46:35,480
Yes.

450
00:46:35,965 --> 00:46:38,238
Was there any particular sharp rock that you hung it on?

451
00:46:38,436 --> 00:46:40,783
No rope would break because of the sharpness of the rock.

452
00:46:41,002 --> 00:46:41,922
The rope was weak.

453
00:46:45,797 --> 00:46:47,431
I need four or five days off.

454
00:46:48,104 --> 00:46:50,871
I have to go to my friend's hometown and report everything to his mother.

455
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:51,981
Where?

456
00:46:52,521 --> 00:46:53,454
Sakata in Yamagata.

457
00:46:53,524 --> 00:46:54,071
Let's go.

458
00:46:54,304 --> 00:46:54,884
I'll go soon.

459
00:46:56,451 --> 00:46:57,804
Ok go ahead.

460
00:46:58,824 --> 00:46:59,631
You need money?

461
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:01,152
Ask our account department..

462
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:13,364
The guy who just left with the branch manager is Executive Director Tokimatsu from Osaka Headquarters.

463
00:47:13,855 --> 00:47:15,502
He says he's here about nylon rope.

464
00:47:19,184 --> 00:47:20,457
A call from the newspaper.

465
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:24,041
Oh Uozu?

466
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:28,487
I ask this not as a reporter, but as a senior member of the mountaineering club.

467
00:47:29,252 --> 00:47:32,712
Kosaka crashed when the rope that bound his body came undone.

468
00:47:33,047 --> 00:47:35,827
As a mountaineer, that's quite a disgrace.

469
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:41,519
So you defend your friend and say something about the rope breaking or something.

470
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,067
I don't know if that's true or not.

471
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:46,461
Tell me.

472
00:47:47,305 --> 00:47:48,532
The rope broke.

473
00:47:49,909 --> 00:47:51,575
That guy was Uozu?

474
00:47:52,039 --> 00:47:55,812
He's convinced that the rope was cut, but that's not good.

475
00:47:56,352 --> 00:48:00,246
Sakura Steel, the company that makes the nylon rope, is a major shareholder in our company.

476
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,063
Yeah, I know, they're brother company.

477
00:48:02,445 --> 00:48:04,338
They're very angry.

478
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:05,417
It can't be helped.

479
00:48:05,859 --> 00:48:10,785
Anyway, Sakura Steel says nylon ropes never break.

480
00:48:10,867 --> 00:48:11,887
But it did break.

481
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:14,894
I don't know if it's really off or not.

482
00:48:15,463 --> 00:48:17,143
What do you mean?

483
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:21,147
Maybe there was a malfunction in the handling.

484
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:24,970
Maybe he stepped on it the night before and scratched it.

485
00:48:25,025 --> 00:48:26,865
Uozu's not a cheap climber.

486
00:48:27,582 --> 00:48:30,462
The rope broke.
Uozu is the only one who knows that.

487
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:32,886
No one knows.
You can trust him.

488
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:34,618
Uozu is not the kind of man who lies.

489
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:39,581
If he says the rope is broken, believe it is broken.

490
00:48:40,336 --> 00:48:42,402
I know his character.

491
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,601
I can't talk with you anymore.

492
00:48:44,628 --> 00:48:45,868
I believe him.

493
00:48:46,297 --> 00:48:52,484
This is going to be a tricky problem.
If the rope breaks, Sakura Steel's credibility will be ruined.

494
00:48:53,004 --> 00:48:54,044
It will be problem.

495
00:49:10,893 --> 00:49:11,486
Uozu

496
00:49:29,452 --> 00:49:33,646
I called your apartment, but I was told you were leaving on this train.

497
00:49:34,624 --> 00:49:35,891
I'm going to Kosaka's hometown.

498
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:38,539
Top row on the left.

499
00:49:43,944 --> 00:49:47,664
I'd really like to ask you something.

500
00:49:48,064 --> 00:49:48,637
What is it?

501
00:49:53,758 --> 00:49:57,671
I think I may have killed Kosaka-san.

502
00:49:57,951 --> 00:49:58,751
That's not true.

503
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:04,016
You must not talk about Kosaka to anyone but me.

504
00:50:12,436 --> 00:50:14,363
For Mr. Kosaka's sister too?

505
00:50:15,191 --> 00:50:15,938
Yes.

506
00:50:17,588 --> 00:50:23,342
She may misunderstand I loved Kosaka.

507
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:29,394
Kosaka is freezing alone in the snow in the mountains right now.

508
00:50:30,818 --> 00:50:32,024
Leave him alone.

509
00:50:34,314 --> 00:50:35,334
See you.

510
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:24,240
He's Uozu.

511
00:51:25,504 --> 00:51:27,024
Welcome.

512
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:47,606
This was my brother's playground.
Tomorrow, when the sun shines, I'll take you somewhere else.

513
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,386
I have to go home tomorrow.

514
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:57,194
I have a duty to perform.

515
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,586
But just for one night?

516
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,820
I'm sure Mother and I will both miss you so much we'll start crying.

517
00:52:12,634 --> 00:52:13,574
I'll go to be first.

518
00:52:15,768 --> 00:52:17,935
Your eyes are getting tired.

519
00:52:18,894 --> 00:52:21,887
Oh,I'm a little tired tonight.

520
00:52:24,897 --> 00:52:29,030
They asked me to test that nylon rope to see if it would break.

521
00:52:31,029 --> 00:52:34,656
It's from Daisaku Tokiwa, the branch manager of Uozu's company.

522
00:52:35,966 --> 00:52:37,486
Why did he ask to you?

523
00:52:38,819 --> 00:52:42,506
Because the nylon in that rope is a product of my company.

524
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,511
Do you think the rope will break in the experiment?

525
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:50,231
We don't know that, that's why we decided to test it.

526
00:52:52,231 --> 00:52:53,471
What do you think?

527
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,598
We're gonna have to test the rope a bunch of times before we make it.

528
00:52:58,588 --> 00:52:59,961
Well, it won't break.

529
00:53:09,708 --> 00:53:11,521
What happens if it doesn't break?

530
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:16,462
It's nothing.
It's just a matter of restoring confidence in nylon rope.

531
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:20,140
What about Uozu's position?

532
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,226
It's going to be difficult.

533
00:53:32,069 --> 00:53:37,489
You told the newspapers that the nylon rope had been cut, and that has irritated headquarters and Sakura Steel quite a bit.

534
00:53:38,577 --> 00:53:40,350
They want you fired.

535
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,467
The rope really was cut.

536
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,271
I know that.

537
00:53:42,679 --> 00:53:48,486
So, for my part, I'd love to do the rope experiment and prove to the world that you're right.

538
00:53:49,773 --> 00:53:53,986
But just to be clear.
You're not going to get yourself in trouble by doing this experiment, are you?

539
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:54,699
No.

540
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:59,160
Were there any flaws during your climb?

541
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:00,127
No.

542
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:05,181
Or Kosaka-kun can cut it himself.

543
00:54:06,037 --> 00:54:06,837
What do you mean?

544
00:54:07,451 --> 00:54:08,137
Suicide.

545
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:12,070
Did you see Minako Yashiro?

546
00:54:14,799 --> 00:54:15,512
Yes.

547
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:18,439
I came to visit while you were at Sakata.

548
00:54:18,969 --> 00:54:21,769
Minako said Kosaka cut the rope to kill himself?

549
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:23,035
Yes.

550
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:27,643
So if you do the experiment, the rope probably won't break.
And that's gonna make your position even more difficult.

551
00:54:28,237 --> 00:54:29,771
She insists that us stop the experiment.

552
00:54:30,446 --> 00:54:32,019
What's her relationship with Kosaka?

553
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,043
She was his friend.

554
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:38,463
I see.

555
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:43,309
Kosaka would never kill himself in the mountains.

556
00:54:44,237 --> 00:54:47,930
Only the mountain and I know the truth about what really happened.

557
00:55:09,207 --> 00:55:11,673
Hello,Yashiro.

558
00:55:12,087 --> 00:55:14,873
This experimental facility is excellent.

559
00:55:15,583 --> 00:55:17,450
I'm sure you'll feel right.

560
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:19,687
He's Uozu.

561
00:55:20,076 --> 00:55:21,016
He's Yashiro.

562
00:55:21,456 --> 00:55:22,469
I'm Uozu.

563
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,393
I'm Yashiro.

564
00:55:23,999 --> 00:55:27,079
You are very young.
My wife told me your name.

565
00:55:28,466 --> 00:55:31,386
Now everything will be clear.

566
00:55:31,942 --> 00:55:35,275
The truth will come out.
And your position will be saved.

567
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:37,091
I'm not certain the rope is cut, though.

568
00:55:41,947 --> 00:55:43,507
Who's going to be there?

569
00:55:44,038 --> 00:55:46,771
There will be two from headquarters and six from Sakura Steel.

570
00:55:47,462 --> 00:55:48,489
And me and you.

571
00:55:48,932 --> 00:55:51,706
You shouldn't be here.

572
00:55:52,394 --> 00:55:56,167
If you show up, the guys at headquarters won't be happy.

573
00:57:18,628 --> 00:57:19,482
Were you asleep?

574
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:20,388
Yes.

575
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:22,362
Carefree bastard.
Let's go home.

576
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:23,642
How was the experiment?

577
00:57:25,469 --> 00:57:28,256
Kyonosuke Yashiro is a good man.
I believe him.

578
00:57:28,756 --> 00:57:31,269
You have to believe in him, too.
Can you believe in him?

579
00:57:31,736 --> 00:57:32,522
Of course I believe him.

580
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,605
The rope didn't break.
The rope was super strong.

581
00:57:38,795 --> 00:57:39,569
Get in the car.

582
00:57:40,015 --> 00:57:40,795
I can't believe it.

583
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:43,399
I thought the rope break.
But It couldn't.

584
00:57:43,566 --> 00:57:44,226
But....

585
00:57:44,286 --> 00:57:46,466
Don't complain.
Get in the car.

586
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:51,408
No one trusts your word anymore.

587
00:57:51,881 --> 00:57:55,321
You stand on colder ground than a wall of ice from this day forward.

588
00:58:22,636 --> 00:58:24,949
Mr. Uozu.
You have a visitor.

589
00:58:24,974 --> 00:58:26,776
She's waiting for you in your room.

590
00:58:40,868 --> 00:58:42,862
I'm sorry I went up there without asking.

591
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:44,535
It's ok.

592
00:58:53,684 --> 00:58:54,577
You look tired.

593
00:58:54,924 --> 00:58:55,471
I'm fine.

594
00:58:55,684 --> 00:58:57,150
You look tired.

595
00:58:58,094 --> 00:58:59,460
I've had too much beer.

596
00:59:02,884 --> 00:59:03,464
The rope?

597
00:59:04,104 --> 00:59:04,977
It didn't break.

598
00:59:11,052 --> 00:59:13,425
It doesn't matter.

599
00:59:14,139 --> 00:59:18,186
You said the rope was cut.
I believe you.

600
00:59:20,042 --> 00:59:23,022
I'm going to the mountains next week with a senior.

601
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,654
To find your brother's body.

602
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:37,263
If we find your brother's body, it'll settle a lot of silly suspicions.

603
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:42,836
He would have had a rope tied neatly around his body.
There would have no suicide note.

604
00:59:42,861 --> 00:59:43,356
suicide note?

605
00:59:44,572 --> 00:59:46,152
You think he killed himself?

606
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:47,592
Some people say that.

607
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:50,096
Yashiro?

608
00:59:52,713 --> 00:59:53,219
right?

609
00:59:56,491 --> 01:00:00,578
I imagined that my brother and that woman were lovers.

610
01:00:01,654 --> 01:00:02,694
I'm sure that's not true.

611
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:07,622
Yashiro must be in love with someone else.

612
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:09,530
He is....

613
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:10,296
Kaoru.

614
01:00:17,224 --> 01:00:19,944
It doesn't matter.
It's none of my business.

615
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:24,862
When you come up the mountain next week, can I come with you?

616
01:00:32,245 --> 01:00:33,192
Welcome.

617
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:36,417
I'm here to see your husband.

618
01:00:36,923 --> 01:00:37,563
He's not here?

619
01:00:38,370 --> 01:00:40,816
He often has meetings on Sundays.

620
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,789
Please come in.

621
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,573
I would have liked to ask him more about the experiment.

622
01:00:47,874 --> 01:00:50,421
Perhaps it would have been better if I had not met him.

623
01:00:51,048 --> 01:00:54,321
I'll see you off.

624
01:01:07,424 --> 01:01:15,544
If Kosaka committed suicide over me, I am not afraid of it.

625
01:01:17,521 --> 01:01:23,368
I am sorry for what happened to Ms. Kosaka, but I had no choice but to do what I did.

626
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:29,221
No matter how nicely I put it, my relationship with Kosaka is a scandal.

627
01:01:29,902 --> 01:01:31,869
I am the one who should be blamed.

628
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:40,905
If you are denying Kosaka's suicide in order to protect me...

629
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:49,485
I don't care if everyone knows about me.

630
01:01:50,601 --> 01:01:54,087
I don't want to cause trouble for you alone.

631
01:01:58,957 --> 01:02:05,557
We may find a red lighter on Kosaka's body, but we will never find his suicide note.

632
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,278
Did you see the lighter?

633
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:17,432
I'm going back up the mountain tomorrow.

634
01:02:18,506 --> 01:02:19,806
To look for Kosaka's body.

635
01:02:21,486 --> 01:02:22,206
Alone?

636
01:02:23,283 --> 01:02:26,143
With his sister this time.

637
01:02:30,270 --> 01:02:31,390
With her.

638
01:03:04,626 --> 01:03:07,326
I was expecting you yesterday.

639
01:03:07,351 --> 01:03:08,539
She's Kosaka's sister.

640
01:03:09,070 --> 01:03:11,130
Thanks for your work.

641
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:12,198
I'm sorry.

642
01:03:13,478 --> 01:03:15,578
Yoshikawa,
Uozu is here.

643
01:03:19,684 --> 01:03:20,758
Thanks,senior.

644
01:03:21,635 --> 01:03:26,047
I went to the second terrace yesterday to look for you in earnest, but I couldn't find anything.

645
01:03:26,884 --> 01:03:29,704
We are going to do another search tomorrow from point B.

646
01:03:30,848 --> 01:03:34,981
You're Kosaka-san's sister, right?
You look a lot like her brother.

647
01:04:12,666 --> 01:04:13,593
Isn't that a rope?

648
01:04:45,783 --> 01:04:46,896
Don't touch the rope.

649
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:09,049
We found his body.

650
01:05:15,033 --> 01:05:17,499
We got his body in the upper middle field.

651
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:19,966
We'll take it tomorrow.

652
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:21,090
How about the rope?

653
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,010
It was neatly tied to the body.

654
01:06:44,648 --> 01:06:45,881
Watch out!

655
01:07:14,126 --> 01:07:15,033
They're back.

656
01:07:27,499 --> 01:07:29,046
Thank you for your hard work.

657
01:08:10,643 --> 01:08:11,636
Please burn incense.

658
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:50,106
I made coffee.

659
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,337
And this is my brother's notebook.

660
01:11:18,911 --> 01:11:20,465
I knew he didn't kill himself.

661
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:43,579
I'm telling you.

662
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:54,292
That's what I was thinking tonight as I watched the fire burn my brother.

663
01:11:55,999 --> 01:11:58,959
I am really serious about it.

664
01:12:00,036 --> 01:12:03,916
I'll never be able to say it again if I forget the color of that fire.

665
01:12:05,742 --> 01:12:09,509
For the first time in my life, I'm thinking about marriage.

666
01:12:09,936 --> 01:12:10,870
Don't laugh.

667
01:12:11,430 --> 01:12:12,343
I don't.

668
01:12:16,735 --> 01:12:17,402
I'm telling you.

669
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,968
I wanted to ask you to marry me.

670
01:12:26,682 --> 01:12:29,536
I am really serious about it.

671
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:32,886
Kaoru,
You're excited, too.

672
01:12:33,756 --> 01:12:35,503
Let's go inside.

673
01:12:36,682 --> 01:12:37,969
Leave me alone.

674
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:42,249
I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight.

675
01:13:05,146 --> 01:13:05,573
And?

676
01:13:05,866 --> 01:13:07,040
There was no will, no note, nothing.

677
01:13:08,237 --> 01:13:09,757
Nothing in the diary either.

678
01:13:11,412 --> 01:13:13,692
There was also a rope tied neatly around his body.

679
01:13:16,731 --> 01:13:19,884
I brought it with me because I thought it might lead to some kind of scientific conclusion.

680
01:13:24,938 --> 01:13:27,565
All right.
I'll take this to Mr. Yashiro.

681
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:28,151
I'll go with you.

682
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:30,098
I don't think you should go.

683
01:13:37,711 --> 01:13:41,518
I brought the rope that was attached to the body of the person in distress.

684
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:43,192
You want me to look at it?

685
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:44,492
Welcome.

686
01:13:44,977 --> 01:13:52,364
This is a layman's idea.
I was wondering if you could take a look at the rope cuts, see if you can find anything new.

687
01:13:52,599 --> 01:13:53,572
I don't think so.

688
01:13:54,020 --> 01:13:54,987
You stay here.

689
01:13:58,421 --> 01:13:59,401
This is it.

690
01:14:00,671 --> 01:14:01,545
Shall I open it?

691
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:03,918
Leave it as it is.

692
01:14:04,175 --> 01:14:05,715
It's the same when I look at it.

693
01:14:05,879 --> 01:14:07,785
I'm sorry.

694
01:14:09,188 --> 01:14:16,548
Amateurs are funny.
If I looked at this under a microscope, I would immediately discover something very important.

695
01:14:18,992 --> 01:14:22,612
Of course, there are ways to examine rope cuts from various angles.

696
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:27,449
We may be able to figure out the meaning of the cut to some extent if we look into it.

697
01:14:29,072 --> 01:14:32,592
But even so...

698
01:14:33,142 --> 01:14:36,495
I don't think it will be of much use in solving the rope experiment.

699
01:14:37,212 --> 01:14:41,679
Like the last experiment, it's just to provide the material for judgment.

700
01:14:41,708 --> 01:14:47,941
If that's the way experiments are supposed to be, then maybe you shouldn't have taken on the last one.

701
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:55,063
I think the idea that the rope was deliberately cut by human hands for the sake of that experiment has been generally accepted.

702
01:14:55,095 --> 01:14:56,522
I was just experimenting.

703
01:14:57,879 --> 01:14:59,885
I don't know anyone who draws conclusions on their own.

704
01:15:00,263 --> 01:15:01,350
That's just human nature.

705
01:15:02,506 --> 01:15:06,153
Someone has been hurt, someone has suffered because of your experiment.

706
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,632
Do you ever think about that?

707
01:15:11,646 --> 01:15:14,259
You don't know the human heart.

708
01:15:14,355 --> 01:15:16,055
Do you believe what Uozu say?

709
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,809
I brought it , and I forced to take it.
I'll leave now.

710
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:49,673
Excuse me. Hello. Is Mr. Uozu there?

711
01:15:49,957 --> 01:15:58,533
Even if the investigation shows that this cut was worn out by a rocky corner...
We can't write about it in the paper.

712
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,480
It's too old and has no news value.

713
01:16:02,716 --> 01:16:06,023
If you'd like, I can put it in a sports article in one of the corners.

714
01:16:06,048 --> 01:16:07,811
No, thank you.

715
01:16:35,596 --> 01:16:38,522
Tokiwa came to see you today.

716
01:16:38,877 --> 01:16:42,174
I just heard the results from the branch manager.

717
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:46,369
I think your husband has a point.

718
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:48,284
I'm sorry.

719
01:16:48,940 --> 01:16:54,463
Don't worry about it anymore.

720
01:16:57,621 --> 01:17:01,043
How did the rope break?
Only the mountain knows that.

721
01:17:01,363 --> 01:17:02,223
That's all right.

722
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:05,777
As long as it proves Kosaka didn't kill himself, that's all that matters.

723
01:17:08,324 --> 01:17:08,980
Madam.

724
01:17:11,824 --> 01:17:14,410
The red lighter was burned in the mountains with Kosaka.

725
01:17:20,698 --> 01:17:25,143
I'm not going to see you again.

726
01:17:27,346 --> 01:17:27,932
Why?

727
01:17:29,096 --> 01:17:33,549
It shouldn't be.
I thought to myself, I have to stop what's wrong.

728
01:17:34,596 --> 01:17:35,776
For the sake of two people.

729
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:38,963
For the sake of two people?

730
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:43,877
One is a living person and one is a dead one.

731
01:17:44,932 --> 01:17:49,456
Of course, one is Yashiro and one is Kosaka.

732
01:17:55,260 --> 01:18:00,635
Kosaka wanted you to see the cliffs of winter mountain.

733
01:18:02,229 --> 01:18:13,205
If there's someone who wants to show the icy cliffs of Winter Mountain...
I think it's you.

734
01:18:18,049 --> 01:18:19,284
Excuse me.

735
01:18:32,311 --> 01:18:33,701
Welcome back.

736
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:39,990
I'm sorry to have disturbed you while you were away again.
It's only been five minutes.

737
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:46,607
I brought my brother's bones to Sakata.

738
01:18:47,287 --> 01:18:48,294
I see...

739
01:18:54,451 --> 01:18:57,373
What's wrong?
You look tired.

740
01:18:58,248 --> 01:18:58,779
No.

741
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:03,857
You look tired.
You have a blue streak on your forehead.

742
01:19:04,279 --> 01:19:04,935
blue streak?

743
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:09,529
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

744
01:19:10,380 --> 01:19:16,583
It's a red streak.
I'm sorry, it's not red, it's a yellow streak.

745
01:19:22,385 --> 01:19:25,057
What's wrong with it... red or yellow?

746
01:19:26,330 --> 01:19:30,049
You looked so cold.

747
01:19:31,698 --> 01:19:34,807
If I were Mrs. Yashiro, you wouldn't look like that.

748
01:19:36,752 --> 01:19:37,463
Right?

749
01:19:38,573 --> 01:19:39,721
You're probably right.

750
01:19:55,268 --> 01:19:56,276
Are you leaving?

751
01:19:58,307 --> 01:20:02,362
I came here tonight to ask your answer to my marriage proposal.

752
01:20:04,393 --> 01:20:07,580
But I don't want to.

753
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,698
I'm crying.
It's not because it's hard for you to give up.

754
01:20:15,549 --> 01:20:19,885
I'm sad that I can't give up my life like my brother.

755
01:20:34,428 --> 01:20:35,693
Let's get married.

756
01:20:36,873 --> 01:20:38,850
You don't have to force yourself to get married.

757
01:20:39,701 --> 01:20:43,443
I'm not forcing myself to get married.
I'm getting married because I want to.

758
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:47,881
But Mr. Uozu, you love Mrs. Yashiro, don't you?

759
01:20:49,834 --> 01:20:54,623
I would hate to have the slightest hint of Yashiro in your mind.

760
01:20:58,912 --> 01:21:00,475
Let's go to the mountains

761
01:21:02,842 --> 01:21:05,631
Let's climb a winter mountain together and wash it all away

762
01:21:10,091 --> 01:21:12,060
I'll climb from the Takase River.

763
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:16,208
You, as I told you the other day, climb from Kamikochi.

764
01:21:18,763 --> 01:21:22,692
When we meet in the mountains, we'll see a different landscape.

765
01:21:24,044 --> 01:21:26,528
I will be a completely different person from the one I am now.

766
01:21:29,192 --> 01:21:31,982
Then I'll go back to Tokyo and we'll get married.

767
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:52,408
I'd like to take five days off.

768
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:54,994
The mountains?

769
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:57,752
I need a vacation.

770
01:21:59,682 --> 01:22:01,221
Rest your head

771
01:22:02,525 --> 01:22:04,533
You won't get a vacation for the next year.

772
01:22:05,689 --> 01:22:07,963
I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you this time.

773
01:22:08,463 --> 01:22:09,963
Don't say a word.

774
01:22:12,010 --> 01:22:12,893
Thank you very much.

775
01:22:27,745 --> 01:22:29,846
I'll be waiting for you in Tokugawa on the 13th.

776
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:33,766
Take care.

777
01:22:36,820 --> 01:22:39,484
This is my brother's camera.
Take it.

778
01:22:44,664 --> 01:22:45,867
see you 13th.

779
01:23:40,289 --> 01:23:41,188
Hello.

780
01:23:42,711 --> 01:23:43,579
I'm Kosaka.

781
01:23:45,329 --> 01:23:48,102
I remember you.
Are you alone?

782
01:23:49,008 --> 01:23:50,969
I'm meeting Mr. Uozu here.

783
01:23:52,164 --> 01:23:55,102
He's coming here from Kitakama.

784
01:23:55,469 --> 01:23:57,047
I see.

785
01:23:57,072 --> 01:23:59,313
He will be here tomorrow.
Please let him stay here.

786
01:23:59,430 --> 01:24:02,946
Sure.
Mr. Uozu is coming.

787
01:24:03,188 --> 01:24:04,344
Come in.

788
01:28:39,451 --> 01:28:42,849
Injured in an avalanche at about 15:30

789
01:28:45,537 --> 01:28:48,146
Unable to move at all due to femur fracture

790
01:28:50,654 --> 01:28:52,904
Intermittent drowsiness of consciousness

791
01:28:55,240 --> 01:29:01,568
I did not pay attention to the abnormality of the new snowball.

792
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:04,318
In short, it is reckless

793
01:29:06,185 --> 01:29:11,896
I've been in a disaster, and I don't think I'm going to make it.

794
01:29:13,178 --> 01:29:16,553
I'm in this mess again.

795
01:29:20,701 --> 01:29:25,123
No gas at all
The weather is wonderful.

796
01:29:27,092 --> 01:29:28,482
2:15 PM.

797
01:29:30,389 --> 01:29:33,654
No pain at all, no chills

798
01:29:35,295 --> 01:29:40,904
It's quiet, infinitely quiet.

799
01:30:19,605 --> 01:30:31,238
As you all know from the newspapers, our good friend Uozu was lost in Kitakama and was found dead this morning.

800
01:30:32,723 --> 01:30:35,629
Please say a silent prayer for Uozu.

801
01:30:37,519 --> 01:30:38,355
Silent Prayer

802
01:30:48,569 --> 01:30:55,382
If you ask me if Mr. Uozu was a good employee, I hesitate to answer that he was a good employee unconditionally.

803
01:30:55,803 --> 01:31:00,405
He was not an ideal good subordinate, at least not for me.

804
01:31:02,608 --> 01:31:04,186
He took a vacation and climbed a mountain.

805
01:31:05,475 --> 01:31:08,788
He lied and climbed a mountain.
Was the mountain that important to him?

806
01:31:09,741 --> 01:31:12,897
Was the mountain more important to him than the company or me?

807
01:31:13,835 --> 01:31:17,210
If the mountain was so important to him, why didn't he just say so?

808
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:22,007
That's the one thing he's not good at...

809
01:31:28,547 --> 01:31:29,359
It's all right.

810
01:31:30,851 --> 01:31:31,976
I'll forgive him.

811
01:31:34,375 --> 01:31:39,398
He was a good climber.
You can see it in his notebooks, where he wrote it down exactly.

812
01:31:40,625 --> 01:31:45,500
How did Uozu die?
Well, it's pretty clear. He was a brave climber.

813
01:31:50,133 --> 01:31:57,422
He takes the fight to the places where nature has rejected man, armed with technology and will.

814
01:31:59,203 --> 01:32:01,820
It's a man's fight, to be sure.

815
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:13,965
But...

816
01:32:15,543 --> 01:32:17,362
Uozu doesn't have to die.

817
01:32:19,222 --> 01:32:20,285
He's idiot!

818
01:32:26,355 --> 01:32:31,902
Uozu's remains are leaving for his hometown in Hamamatsu on the 6 a.m. train tomorrow morning.

819
01:32:33,238 --> 01:32:34,550
Will you go?

820
01:32:38,488 --> 01:32:44,604
I wanted to see Uozu again, but now I can't.

821
01:33:24,991 --> 01:33:28,687
I am sure Uozu is very happy that you did everything for him.

822
01:33:29,148 --> 01:33:32,999
Uozu did it for me when my brother died, so I did it for him this time.

823
01:33:34,742 --> 01:33:38,085
Why don't we have dinner alone sometime?
I'll set the table.

824
01:33:41,694 --> 01:33:42,413
I'll take you home.

825
01:33:42,702 --> 01:33:49,069
No, I'm going to Uozu's apartment now.
I'll go to Uozu's apartment to arrange his stuff.

826
01:33:51,616 --> 01:33:52,437
How about you?

827
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:04,526
I'm going to town.
Excuse me.

828
01:35:16,787 --> 01:35:24,990
THE END

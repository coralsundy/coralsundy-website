<i>AT THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE (Episode 1)</i>

3
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:53,820
I'm reflected in your eyes.

4
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,805
And I'm reflected in your eyes.

5
00:00:58,805 --> 00:01:00,023
Yoko-san.

6
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,490
I love you.

7
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,521
Mitsuharu-san.

8
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:58,690
Wow.

9
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,270
Yoko-san, let's get married.

10
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,690
Soon after we graduate.

11
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,400
I'll definitely make you happy.

12
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:18,297
SUKIYA BRIDGE

13
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,380
I'm worried.

14
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,180
If I leave today and go home,
when will I see you again?

15
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,200
It's only six more months.

16
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,740
Six months?

17
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,640
What do you mean six months?

18
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,250
As soon as I graduate and
get a job, I'm coming for you.

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,680
All right.

20
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:49,199
Before I go to your
house and ask for your hand,

21
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:53,940
you have to take care of your father and
heal him so that you can come to Tokyo with me.

22
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,526
Thank you, Mitsuharu-san.

23
00:02:57,553 --> 00:03:00,550
Next time we meet here, we'll be engaged.

24
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,000
Right.

25
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,290
So take care of yourself.

26
00:03:04,886 --> 00:03:05,745
Okay.

27
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:14,305
KUJUKU ISLANDS, NAGASAKI

28
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:24,200
No matter how many times you say it,

29
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,140
I have no control over Yoko's situation.

30
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,800
Everything has to be decided
by my eldest son in Tokyo.

31
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,690
I cannot give you any answer.

32
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,300
I understand.

33
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,900
I'm going back to Tokyo and
talk to her brother about it.

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,180
But…

35
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,340
What do you think…

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,004
about my marriage to Yoko-san?

37
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,013
You came all the way from Tokyo to see me.

38
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,580
I'm really sorry about that.

39
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,500
Can't you at least stay one night?

40
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,680
I'm not a student anymore, so
I can't do whatever I want.

41
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,560
But we haven't seen each other in six months.

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,875
I'll meet up with your brother
as soon as I get back to Tokyo.

43
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:31,880
You'd better do that.

44
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:34,620
I'm sure my brother will understand.

45
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,830
I've met him a few times myself.

46
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:38,970
So it's going to be all right.

47
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,480
So just make your father well again.

48
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,430
So that you can come to
Tokyo whenever you want, okay?

49
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:06,900
TOYO LIGHT METAL CO.

50
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,810
Please come in.

51
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:14,980
What is it? What do they want from me?

52
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,620
I don't know.

53
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,820
Niimura is here.

54
00:05:18,078 --> 00:05:21,172
YOKO NIIMURA

55
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,320
- Niimura-kun, is it?
- Yes, sir.

56
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:25,530
You know him, don't you?

57
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,580
He's the father of Director Sawano.

58
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,150
Yes, I know.

59
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:29,980
I don't see the resemblance.

60
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,350
Unfortunately, I don't
remember that beauty either.

61
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,280
Why did your sister quit the company?

62
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,430
Oh.

63
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,330
She temporarily quit due to family reasons.

64
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:41,840
What is it?

65
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,430
Actually, you see, this is a marriage proposal.

66
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,370
My son is very much enamored with your sister.

67
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,100
He has a weak spot for her.

68
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,060
Where is Niimura-kun?

69
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,165
He was just called into
the president's office.

70
00:05:57,189 --> 00:05:58,210
Oh, that's fine then.

71
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,450
Yes.

72
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:01,660
A visitor?

73
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,550
Niimura is not here.

74
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:04,990
He's in the president's office now.

75
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,520
<i>I didn't expect that.</i>

76
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:25,030
<i>Why is your brother against our marriage?</i>

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,332
<i>Your brother looked at me as
if I were a thief or something…</i>

78
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,733
<i>He left before I could say anything else.</i>

79
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:41,320
<i>I left the office like I was being kicked out.</i>

80
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:44,900
<i>Yoko-san.</i>

81
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:49,410
<i>Yoko-san, I know you're
at the far end of Kyushu.</i>

82
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:56,050
<i>If I could reach you,
I wish I could hold you now.</i>

83
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,680
<i>Yoko-san, I want you to make up
your mind and come to Tokyo.</i>

84
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,570
<i>I'm waiting for you.</i>

85
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,820
<i>As promised, I'm waiting for you at the
small park at the foot of the Sukiya Bridge.</i>

86
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:09,270
<i>No matter what anyone says, we'll get married.</i>

87
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,690
<i>And we'll be happy.</i>

88
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,460
Call an ambulance!

89
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,375
Hang in there. Are you okay?

90
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,046
Are you okay?

91
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,910
His legs are bruised.

92
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,820
The right arm looks like a
severe compound fracture.

93
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:33,490
Good work.

94
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,100
We might need to amputate his right arm.

95
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,820
Bring me the equipment.

96
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,060
Yes, sir.

97
00:07:36,484 --> 00:07:37,520
Excuse me, you've got to help me.

98
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:37,770
Sure.

99
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,450
[INDISTINCT]

100
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,500
[INDISTINCT]

101
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,100
I have to…

102
00:07:43,851 --> 00:07:45,065
I have to!

103
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:48,260
I… I'm an architect.

104
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:51,010
[INDISTINCT] The design…design…

105
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,020
Doctor!

106
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,440
It's okay, it's okay.

107
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,100
Hang in there.

108
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,149
Here.

109
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,460
It'll be over soon.

110
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,233
Yoko-san.

111
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,480
<i>Mitsuharu-san.</i>

112
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,970
<i>Why won't you write to me?</i>

113
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,280
<i>What happened to you?</i>

114
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:16,670
<i>My brother has brought me
another marriage proposal.</i>

115
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:19,870
<i>Did you meet with my brother?</i>

116
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:24,930
<i>It has been more than three
months since we parted on this island.</i>

117
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,870
<i>I can't stand it any longer.</i>

118
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,070
<i>My father is feeling a little better.</i>

119
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:35,320
<i>I'm going to Tokyo.</i>

120
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,730
<i>I have only one purpose.</i>

121
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,500
<i>I only want to meet with you, Mitsuharu-san.</i>

122
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,900
<i>At that small park by Sukiya Bridge.</i>

123
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,770
Mitsuharu-san!

124
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,830
It's been a while.

125
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:31,030
As you can see,

126
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:33,440
I'm still too nervous to walk alone.

127
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,780
We can't really talk out here.

128
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,070
Two cups of coffee, please.

129
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,070
Certainly.

130
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,380
I…thought about writing you a letter.

131
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,300
But I thought that if I had written
to you, I'd have only hurt you.

132
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,110
How very self-serving of you.

133
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,500
Do you know how many letters
I've written in the last six months?

134
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,160
I wish you'd have figured it out yourself.

135
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,550
Figure what out?

136
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,080
You promised so much on the island--

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,460
Yoko-san.

138
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,060
I'm not the old Mitsuharu Sugano anymore.

139
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,470
Look at this hand.

140
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,840
Look at my legs.

141
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,740
I'm a changed man.

142
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,380
No.

143
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,380
That's not true.

144
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,780
There must be some other reason.

145
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,920
Just say it. Don't try to play games with me.

146
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,120
There's no other reason.

147
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,500
You can imagine whatever you want.

148
00:11:38,212 --> 00:11:43,579

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,920
That was dangerous!

156
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,920
Yoko-san!

157
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,790
Back up! Back up!

158
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,620
I knew it was you.

159
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:21,880
It's me.

160
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,280
Fujikawa.

161
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,690
Okay.

162
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:30,890
Madam, I'm going to take a seat.

163
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,540
Oh, no.

164
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,220
Don't peek too much into our dressing rooms.

165
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,700
Go ahead.

166
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,940
This is kind of like my nest.

167
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,950
Fujikawa-san, would you like
some freshly made rice balls?

168
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:51,490
Well, I heard that Sugano graduated and
went to work for Imura-sensei's design office.

169
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,660
I haven't had a chance to meet him yet.

170
00:13:56,030 --> 00:14:00,040
I shouldn't have been
away in Kyushu for a year.

171
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,840
I mean, you believed in Sugano, right?

172
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:05,760
Yes, I did.

173
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,634
But…

174
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,130
Well? It'll calm you down. Have a drink.

175
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:16,510
Here.

176
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,720
What's that? You're an idiot.

177
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,180
She's not a hussy like
you lot, she can't drink.

178
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,770
Madam!

179
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,480
Why are you so foul-mouthed?

180
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:36,580
What? Oh, sorry.

181
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,020
Yoko-san.

182
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,380
Well, I'm going to see Sugano.

183
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,890
You should go home to your brother.

184
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,660
If you don't want another
marriage proposal, just say no.

185
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,960
I want to help you, even
if I can help only a little.

186
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:53,790
So, when are we going to
meet Director Sawano's parents?

187
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,680
Yeah, after I got a call from you,

188
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,043
I called the Director right
away to let him know that

189
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,430
Yoko was here, so he'll
decide in a couple of days.

190
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,000
I hope Yoko-san is all right.

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,420
What?

192
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,930
Because she was with that boy Sugano…

193
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,620
I heard he recently got a new woman.

194
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,030
I've been doing some digging.

195
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,710
It seems she was his nurse
when he was hospitalized.

196
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,130
Well…

197
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,220
Then thank goodness you said no to him.

198
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,270
I knew he'd be that kind of a guy anyway.

199
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,320
Welcome home.

200
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,720
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were back, Brother.

201
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,000
You look tired, Yoko.

202
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,410
Was the train crowded?

203
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:37,830
No.

204
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,670
Thanks for taking care
of our father for so long.

205
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,800
Take it easy tonight, we'll talk tomorrow.

206
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,680
Brother!

207
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,030
What is it?

208
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,430
Well…

209
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,980
Did Sugano-san come to see you sometime?

210
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:54,980
Sugano?

211
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,770
Oh, a friend of yours from school, right?

212
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,235
Didn't he use to come to our house sometime?

213
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:01,630
Yes, did he come to see you?

214
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,030
No, I don't recall that.

215
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:06,110
I see.

216
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,340
This is Sugano-kun's
sketch. Can you believe it?

217
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,270
This is Sugano's?

218
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,090
There's no trace of his old talent.

219
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,570
I ordered him to redraft it.

220
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,370
He's lost the use of his right
hand because of an accident.

221
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,350
No, this is not about his hands.

222
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,030
He has no inspiration now.

223
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,480
Actually, you came to visit him
today, but he's absent without leave.

224
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,570
Don't you think it's strange
for a very promising young man?

225
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,750
He must be out of his mind to show this to you.

226
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,070
This is a mental problem.

227
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,850
He's troubled about something right now.

228
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,970
I'm trying to give him a job in Hokkaido.

229
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,130
Hokkaido?

230
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:43,810
He needs a new life.

231
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,270
What do you think?

232
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,710
Did Sugano say he's going?

233
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,690
He's badly struggling right now.

234
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:02,690
Sorry.

235
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,360
Did I disturb you?

236
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,240
No.

237
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,310
It's okay.

238
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,340
Your hands will get better.

239
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,230
Don't get upset. Okay?

240
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,570
By the way…

241
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:25,200
I was on my way home from the hospital, and it
smelled so good, I bought so many croquettes.

242
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,550
They're still warm.

243
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:28,850
Hey.

244
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,750
Do you want to eat together?

245
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:31,900
It's okay, right?

246
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,240
Sugano-san, you have a visitor.

247
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,720
Hey, Sugano.

248
00:17:39,261 --> 00:17:40,990
Oh, Fujikawa-san.

249
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,280
It's been a while.

250
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,730
How's your arm?

251
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,260
Yeah, it's much better.

252
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:51,360
I went to Imura-sensei's today
and he told me you took the day off.

253
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,350
Please come in.

254
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
Shall I make you some tea?

255
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
Please.

256
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:02,940
He's mad at you

257
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,090
for taking a day off without notice.

258
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:06,090
Is that so?

259
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,410
I heard you're going to Hokkaido.

260
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,600
Are you two going together?

261
00:18:12,811 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:16,084 --> 00:18:18,850
I was surprised to hear about Hokkaido.

263
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:24,130
I'm going to Hokkaido in the near future.

264
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:27,249
I see.

265
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,760
Then before you go,

266
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,060
you should have another x-ray.

267
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,500
Sugano.

268
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,410
I met Yoko-san yesterday.

269
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,510
What?

270
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,240
That poor girl.

271
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,770
She feels betrayed by you.

272
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:49,760
Hey, Sugano.

273
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,930
Did you really do something to betray her?

274
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,250
Or maybe you got a weird
complex from being injured.

275
00:18:58,224 --> 00:19:00,730
I hope you're not thinking of
stepping aside for Yoko-san's sake--

276
00:19:00,730 --> 00:19:01,220
No!

277
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,860
Please don't talk about that.

278
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,900
Okay.

279
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,820
You and I have always gotten
along oddly enough since school.

280
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:12,791
You're my older brother in terms of talent,

281
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:15,100
but I consider myself a
senior in terms of worldliness.

282
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,060
Hey.

283
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,970
Why can't you talk to me about all this?

284
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,270
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:25,090
My current suffering is…

286
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:30,050
I believe that I have no
choice but to solve it myself.

287
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,950
Oh, hello.

288
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,121
Um, this is a rather impolite question, but…

289
00:19:39,223 --> 00:19:40,246
Yes?

290
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,240
What kind of relationship do
you have with Sugano-kun?

291
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,920
What kind of question is that?

292
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,400
Huh?

293
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,770
I'm a visiting nurse, a friend, a…

294
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,640
And a lover?

295
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,100
If I were his lover, if he didn't tell
me that he was going to Hokkaido…

296
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:02,180
That's strange.

297
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,620
This is not a lucky night for me.

298
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,190
As you see.

299
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,790
Toki-san.

300
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,620
I was going to say something
a little earlier about Hokkaido…

301
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,060
It's okay.

302
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,010
I'm sorry.

303
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,790
It's better this way.

304
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,710
I get so worried when you're around
that I just keep coming to visit you.

305
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,110
But if you go to Hokkaido, I can give up.

306
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,190
Before you come back…

307
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,850
…I'm going to get married.

308
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,790
I'm going to get married in an
arranged marriage or something.

309
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:06,960
Mitsuharu-san.

310
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,950
When you are in Hokkaido,

311
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,640
what if you were with her?

312
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,380
With the woman you parted ways with yesterday.

313
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:21,410
Because it's silly to look at sketches
of your memories all the time.

314
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,640
Yoko.

315
00:21:52,830 --> 00:21:58,240
Tonight I went to a bar in Ginza,
courtesy of Director Sawano.

316
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,240
Well, he totally treated me.

317
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:07,300
But when you're a Director,
you're popular even in a bar.

318
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:09,970
Yoko, this is for you.

319
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,940
The Director insisted that
I give it to you. It's a cake.

320
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,380
Want some?

321
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,330
No, I…

322
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:21,280
Oh, well, I'll just take it then,
and I'll give it to my subordinates.

323
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,080
We'll just thank him tomorrow.

324
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,640
Tomorrow?

325
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:29,340
Yeah, we're going to have dinner tomorrow.

326
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,580
I don't want to.

327
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,800
Idiot.

328
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,940
The Director is inviting us
as a favor, how can I refuse?

329
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,390
We're going to dinner.

330
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,030
You should join us.

331
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,250
I see.

332
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,420
I'm surprised.

333
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,570
I didn't know she was this beautiful.

334
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,570
You're right, Sawano-san has a discerning eye.

335
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,750
No, ma'am, it was Yoko-san's work
ethic that caught my attention first.

336
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:55,180
So she's not like you in that respect.

337
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,190
Niimura-san, where's your wife today?

338
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,950
It's just that we have three children…

339
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,390
It would have been nice if you
had brought her on a day like this.

340
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,670
I'm sorry.

341
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,560
Yoko-san.

342
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,970
I heard your father is
not feeling well. Is he sick?

343
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,360
Yes, he has a mild cerebral hemorrhage.

344
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:13,310
Well, well, that's a long illness.

345
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,980
Everything's ready.

346
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,170
They say they're ready.

347
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,140
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

348
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,635
Hey, what does that mean?

349
00:23:28,896 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm surprised, too.

350
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,390
But it can't be helped.

351
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:35,380
It's bothersome, isn't it, Yoko-san?

352
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,980
…No.

353
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:41,050
Shall we end this formal meeting
early and go to Ginza later?

354
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:44,230
Niimura-kun, please take care of the rest.

355
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:45,970
Madam.

356
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,810
Sugano will leave for Hokkaido by
plane and will not be back for a while.

357
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,810
He wants to see his
friend Yoko-san before that.

358
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:53,500
What are you going to do when you see her?

359
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:56,130
They would have to talk
to each other to know that.

360
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:59,580
Sugano-san, I believe my
husband has turned you down.

361
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,080
I don't want you to wait for Yoko.

362
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:04,690
You have no right to say that.

363
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,190
It's Yoko's matchmaking day today.

364
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,030
Matchmaking?

365
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,780
That's ridiculous.

366
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,690
That's a lie.

367
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:11,940
What do you mean it's a lie!

368
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,340
If you don't believe me, ask the Prince Hotel.

369
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,640
Her date is a young director.

370
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,550
The president of the company is
taking on the role of matchmaker.

371
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,990
But Yoko-san is--

372
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:24,320
Yoko, you know, volunteered to go.

373
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,110
- No, I'm not talking about--
- Sugano-san.

374
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,770
I heard that you have a woman with you.

375
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,560
How could you come here?

376
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,230
Did Yoko-san tell you that?

377
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,640
Yes, she did.

378
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,000
So she chose this matchmaking
on her own after thinking about it.

379
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,500
Do you still want to interrupt her?

380
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,680
You're a brazen one, aren't you?

381
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,700
You say a lot of things that are hard to say.

382
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,560
Fujikawa-san.

383
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,260
That's enough.

384
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:54,100
Please just tell Yoko-san
that I came to say goodbye.

385
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,840
Please.

386
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,290
I see.

387
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,200
Thank you very much for your time.

388
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,640
Stop a car, you're going to miss your flight.

389
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,410
What's that? You're the one who stalled me.

390
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,190
Hey, stop! Stop for a second!

391
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:14,050
Sugano-san, find a nice woman in Hokkaido.

392
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:19,660
<i>(ANNOUNCEMENT): I would like to
inform you about your departure flight.</i>

393
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,730
<i>(ANNOUNCEMENT):  Japan Airlines…</i>

394
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:23,950
Oh.

395
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:24,750
Time to go.

396
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,090
- You got the card?
- Yes.

397
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,030
Take care.

398
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,740
Forget about her.

399
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,050
I might go there sometime.

400
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,250
See you in Hokkaido.

401
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,330
Okay?

402
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,040
You were right…

403
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,020
I should have been more honest…
I should have said I love her if I love her.

404
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,030
But… it's too late.

405
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,460
Idiot.

406
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:29,120
Congratulations on the successful agreement
of your marriage with the Niimura family.

407
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:34,620
I have brought the betrothal gift to
you today, as it is a very lucky day.

408
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,276
Yoko.

409
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:43,120
Yoko!

410
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:44,770
Yoko!

411
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,170
How unusual.

412
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,180
I wasn't expecting you to visit.

413
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,210
What's wrong?

414
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,500
I've come to ask you for a favor.

415
00:26:58,736 --> 00:26:59,670
What is it?

416
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,480
Please take a seat.

417
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:08,620
I would like you to break
off your engagement with me.

418
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,970
What?

419
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:13,660
I never said I was okay with this proposal.

420
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:14,870
That's…

421
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,030
But I haven't heard that.

422
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,390
Please don't blame my brother.

423
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,330
It's my fault for not being
clear with my brother.

424
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:26,640
No, this is not a matter
of blaming your brother.

425
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,860
I'm sorry.

426
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,160
You've got to be kidding me.

427
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,250
Think about the president of the
company who agreed to be our matchmaker.

428
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,930
I don't know how even the good-hearted
president would feel about me or your brother.

429
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:42,370
Maybe your brother would
have a harder time than I do.

430
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,950
Please, help my brother…

431
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,170
Don't ask too much of me.

432
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:48,770
Yoko-san.

433
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,480
Do you hate me that much?

434
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,150
It's not like that…

435
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,420
So are you saying that you like someone else?

436
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,540
Is it Mitsuharu Sugano?

437
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,570
Sorry, but I've been
doing a lot of investigating.

438
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,760
But I don't mind.

439
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,420
Everybody has done that once or twice.

440
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,470
Especially a beautiful woman like you…

441
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:20,540
I, excuse me--

442
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,430
Wait a minute. Please think calmly.

443
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:27,580
I decided from the moment you joined the
company that you were going to be my wife.

444
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,390
That's enough!

445
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:30,880
We disagree on a lot of things,
but I'm not changing my mind.

446
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,300
Yoko-san.

447
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:35,040
I can make you happy.

448
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,790
I'm going home.

449
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,840
Go ahead.

450
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,500
But, Yoko-san, I'm not giving up.

451
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,940
He was already gone last Sunday, so it's
been ten days since he went to Hokkaido.

452
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:54,160
Hokkaido?

453
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,540
I think Toki-san can tell you where he is.

454
00:28:58,330 --> 00:28:59,760
Who is this Toki-san?

455
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,010
She's a visiting nurse who lives here.

456
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,719
She's been taking care of
Sugano-san for a long time,

457
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,750
so we just assumed that the two of
them were going to Hokkaido together.

458
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,340
She's working at the hospital now.

459
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,540
He's at the Yubari Coal Mine in Hokkaido.

460
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,510
It's a construction site.

461
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,390
But why didn't he tell you?

462
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,800
He didn't have to tell me.

463
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,400
Why not?

464
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,490
But you're Mitsuharu-san's lover, aren't you?

465
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,190
What?

466
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,690
Such a waste of time to complicate
things when you love each other so much.

467
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,100
Complicate things?

468
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,380
I haven't…

469
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,190
Then why?

470
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:39,990
I…

471
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,600
I think you're the one who did that.

472
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,790
Me?

473
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,300
Oh, you must have misunderstood something.

474
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,300
Am I misunderstanding something?

475
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,300
Yes.

476
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,070
I just wanted to know
why you didn't follow him.

477
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,350
All right.

478
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,290
I'm sorry.

479
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,200
I don't blame you for misunderstanding
me after the way we met.

480
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,300
I didn't know anything. I just went along.

481
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:15,400
I've been thinking about you a lot since then.

482
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,408
But…

483
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:23,200
I felt like my happiness would
disappear if I began to talk about it.

484
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,800
I was happy just to listen to him.

485
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,150
I moved into a room in
front of his apartment…

486
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,800
I was content just to see his face every day.

487
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,400
I guess people who don't
know me would think I'm an idiot.

488
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:52,760
I loved Mitsuharu-san, and
Mitsuharu-san loved you.

489
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,800
I didn't know.

490
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,400
But why wasn't the misunderstanding resolved?

491
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,690
Even Fujikawa-san knows about me.

492
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,990
I'm certain that Mitsuharu-san
went to see you, too.

493
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,570
On the night of his departure for Hokkaido.

494
00:31:08,822 --> 00:31:09,570
What?

495
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:13,220
Yoko.

496
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,200
I heard you went directly to the Director
today to refuse the marriage proposal.

497
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,800
Why couldn't you ask me,
your brother, for advice?

498
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,400
What would happen to my
position after that kind of outrage?

499
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,700
You need to think about that a little bit.

500
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,800
Brother, I've not wanted
this from the beginning…

501
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,280
Yoko.

502
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,300
Where do you think you're going?

503
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,500
Where are you going with your bag?

504
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,940
I'm going to Hokkaido.

505
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:36,830
I'm going to Mitsuharu-san's house.

506
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,720
Don't be absurd!

507
00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:41,425
Brother! Just this once,
let me have my own way.

508
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,230
No! I won't allow you to go to Hokkaido.

509
00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:43,780
Yoko-san.

510
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,450
Don't think like a schoolgirl like that.

511
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:47,480
Please.

512
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:50,020
If you're willing to treat me like an adult,

513
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,420
why did you hide the fact
that Mitsuharu-san came here?

514
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:53,420
That's…

515
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:56,450
It's because I thought about your future.

516
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:57,700
That's so selfish!

517
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:58,780
Yoko.

518
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,800
Think about it.

519
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,330
Do you know how everyone is envious that
you and Director Sawano are getting married?

520
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,920
We're doing everything we can
to make sure your future is secure.

521
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:13,760
Nothing you say will change my mind!

522
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,530
Yoko-san, wait!

523
00:32:17,118 --> 00:32:19,780
Wait, please! Please think of us too!

524
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,920
Your brother is on the verge
of becoming an executive.

525
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,620
So that's why you're asking me to marry him?

526
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:27,760
You want me to sacrifice myself.

527
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,020
You idiot!

528
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,520
Yoko-san.

529
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,570
It's not a sacrifice…

530
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,490
We thought about you, too, you know.

531
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:37,790
Suit yourself.

532
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,421
Okay, it's not much, but
you don't know what need.

533
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,175
But…

534
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,880
It's okay.

535
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,840
I'm sorry for the trouble.

536
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,690
It's okay.

537
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,480
Now you can be happy. Okay?

538
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,320
Okay, be careful.

539
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,100
Do you have makeup?

540
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,690
That's not good.

541
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:04,140
Here!

542
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,269
There you go!

543
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,210
Have a good trip!

544
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:08,710
Thank you.

545
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:09,950
Thank you so much.

546
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,690
Take care!

547
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,565
YUBARI, HOKKAIDO

I want to die.

556
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,900
Shall I die with you?

557
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,380
You're early.

558
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,530
It's going to rain today.

559
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,580
Nobu-san.

560
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,070
How did I…

561
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,160
What?

562
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,570
How did I get here?

563
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,160
You don't remember?

564
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,880
You were so drunk. It's no
wonder you don't remember.

565
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,750
Come on.

566
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,380
Wash your face.

567
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:41,410
You and I almost died together last night.

568
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,760
We promised each other we would die together.

569
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:48,230
Did I say that?

570
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,480
It's easy to die.

571
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,460
But it's even easier to live.

572
00:37:57,150 --> 00:38:00,270
See? You're alive.

573
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:08,050
What's wrong with you, you look so worried.

574
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,580
It's okay.

575
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,830
Come early this evening.

576
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:23,825
Sugano-san, a beautiful young
lady came from Tokyo to visit you.

577
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:24,980
What?

578
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,030
I can't believe you went home in the
morning even though you had someone like that.

579
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:28,400
Well…

580
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,300
So where is she?

581
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,900
I gave her the directions to the office.

582
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,450
I'm pretty sure that's her.

583
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,810
I believe she said her name was Yoko.

584
00:38:36,117 --> 00:38:37,080
I see.

585
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,590
Yoko-san.

586
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,980
She said she wanted to go for a short
walk, so I showed her the way to the dam.

587
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:41,680
Thank you.

588
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,580
Yoko-san!

589
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,100
Mitsuharu-san.

590
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:06,640
Yoko-san!

591
00:39:28,173 --> 00:39:29,400
Mitsuharu-san.

592
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,790
I came here…

593
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,260
leaving everything behind.

594
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,690
I've never thought of
marrying anyone other than you.

595
00:39:41,981 --> 00:39:42,690
Yoko-san.

596
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,140
I'm telling you the truth.
I really am. I hope you understand.

597
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:45,800
It was my fault.

598
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,700
It's all my fault, I was weak.

599
00:39:48,246 --> 00:39:49,440
I was…

600
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,390
This hand is to be blamed.

601
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,500
This hand got in our way.

602
00:40:07,015 --> 00:40:08,190
Yes.

603
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:10,000
But it's okay now.

604
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,540
It's getting a lot better.

605
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,350
I don't care if your hands don't get better.

606
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,860
I can be there for you from now on.

607
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,910
I can do anything for you.

608
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:21,920
Right?

609
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,320
I can stay in this town, right?

610
00:40:25,142 --> 00:40:25,685
Yes.

611
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:27,200
But…

612
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,580
You can't say you don't want me to.

613
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,860
I came here determined to do that.

614
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,910
This is the room.

615
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,800
Thank you very much.

616
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,550
Here you go.

617
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,574
Is this room Sugano-san's?

618
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,260
Who are you?

619
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,300
Me?

620
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,730
I'm Yoko Niimura from Tokyo--

621
00:40:58,380 --> 00:40:59,110
From Tokyo?

622
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:00,060
Yes.

623
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:01,800
And you?

624
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,940
I…

625
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,640
I'm Sugano-san's…

626
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:07,610
I'm here to return Sugano-san's belonging.

627
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:08,900
What time is it?

628
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:09,790
What?

629
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,810
Oh, you don't have your watch.

630
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:15,430
The girl at the bar just came to deliver it.

631
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:15,680
And?

632
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:19,550
She probably went to the
inn because you weren't here.

633
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:20,650
What?

634
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,650
Something like this happened in Tokyo too.

635
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:29,890
Mitsuharu-san is so kind-hearted that
I'm sure he couldn't be very clear with me.

636
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:30,694
So…

637
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,279
But…

638
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,050
He's going to marry me.

639
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,270
We just parted today,
promising to live here together.

640
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:57,480
Please don't torment me anymore.

641
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:58,980
Torment you?

642
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:03,050
I… I left my brother's house
as if I was running away.

643
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,430
I can't go home anymore.

644
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:09,150
I'm not sure if that counts as torment.

645
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,150
I suffered like I was dying.

646
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:16,500
You're like a little girl.

647
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,300
Would you be surprised if I told you that
I'm not just a passing acquaintance with him?

648
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:26,630
No! He would never do that!

649
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,180
No?

650
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,540
Please, no more…

651
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,940
I…

652
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,030
I would do anything, if it's
the money that you want.

653
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,250
But I don't have any money here right now.

654
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:40,650
I'll give it to you later--

655
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:42,050
Don't be so self-serving!

656
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,220
There are some things you should
say, and things you shouldn't say.

657
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,370
It's his watch.

658
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,410
I know you recognize it.

659
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,870
He left this watch under
my pillow this morning.

660
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:00,680
No!

661
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:02,110
No way!

662
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:10,880
Nobu-san.

663
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:10,880
Nobu-san.

664
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,334
What did you do?

665
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:17,090
I was just telling her where that watch was.

666
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,580
Yoko-san!

667
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,120
Wait!

668
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,410
You're a terrible person!

669
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:32,990
Are you blaming me?

670
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:36,620
Can you blame me? I was just telling the truth!

671
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,860
Yoko-san!

672
00:44:08,378 --> 00:44:09,860
Yoko-san!

673
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,680
It's her fault!

674
00:44:14,483 --> 00:44:16,350
I was really going to walk away.

675
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,290
- But she made me mad!
- Yoko-san!

676
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,290
Yoko-san!

677
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,290
Yoko-san!

678
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,290
Yoko-san!

679
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:55,000
You are not going to forgive me, are you?

680
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,770
Do you hate me so much?

681
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:05,660
This morning, I was glad to be alive.

682
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,390
I thought everything was going to be okay.

683
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,650
And then I met that girl, and
everything went dark in front of my eyes.

684
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:16,990
And now you're looking at me
like that, I don't know what to do.

685
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:18,560
You…

686
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:21,550
You've ruined things for me and Yoko.

687
00:45:21,550 --> 00:45:22,820
It's not my fault.

688
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,880
It was bad luck!

689
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,180
You promised me last night.

690
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:32,160
That we would die together.

691
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,590
Meeting Yoko won't do any good now.

692
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:36,960
Die with me.

693
00:45:38,086 --> 00:45:39,300
Die with me!

694
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:41,760
Hey! You're being ridiculous.

695
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,270
You don't want to do it?

696
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:44,540
If you don't want to, I'll do it alone!

697
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,820
Wait, wait!

698
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,263
Nobu-san!

699
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,710
Hey, who's the person she tried
to commit double suicide with?

700
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,500
He's an architect named Sugano.

701
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,940
His body hasn't been found yet, though.

702
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,990
Either way, we have to wait until morning.

703
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,990
That's right.

704
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:24,000
He can get swept downstream.

705
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:26,261
By the way, that woman Nobu,

706
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:28,570
wasn't she in this hospital last
year after a failed double suicide?

707
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,510
Tell me about that.

708
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,310
I'm going to write an article about it.

709
00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:49,760
Go ahead.

710
00:47:04,990 --> 00:47:05,500
What about Sugano-san?

711
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:10,400
I see.

712
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,900
You couldn't find him.

713
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,100
I feel sorry for you, too.

714
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,250
Sugano-san and I…

715
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,700
There was nothing between us.

716
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,460
That man was yours.

717
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,300
<i>He's gone.</i>

718
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,450
<i>He's no longer in this world.</i>

719
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:22,050
<i>My soul is also gone from this
world along with Mitsuharu-san's.</i>

720
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:28,850
<i>From now on, what hope is there for me to live?</i>

721
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,300
Father, why don't you
understand? I told you last night.

722
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,220
I know you told me that, but at
least I want to be at the wedding…

723
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,530
You're causing me trouble.

724
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:01,950
Today, the president of the
company and executives will be here.

725
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,490
Are you ready?

726
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,070
Yes.

727
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,960
You're beautiful.

728
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,420
It's almost time, so let's go to the venue.

729
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,480
Okay, then.

730
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,190
I can't leave without seeing a little of Yoko's
happy day after coming all the way here.

731
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:23,330
Don't say that. It's hard for me, too.

732
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,490
Father, don't leave the room.

733
00:49:26,490 --> 00:49:28,250
Do you understand? Okay, then.

734
00:49:35,290 --> 00:49:35,420
Um…

735
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:40,830
As the matchmaker, I will first
introduce the bride and groom.

736
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:46,850
The groom, Shinsuke Sawano, is
currently the sales director of our company.

737
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:53,110
I'm sure you all know that he's rapidly
improving the sales performance of our company.

738
00:50:05,426 --> 00:50:08,615
MIYAZAKI NICHINAN COAST

739
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,660
<i>We flew to Miyazaki for our honeymoon.</i>

740
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,490
<i>And then to Kagoshima.</i>
KAGOSHIMA

741
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:24,610
<i>And then to Saikai, near my hometown.</i>

742
00:50:25,492 --> 00:50:28,290
 SAIKAI BRIDGE

743
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:31,890
<i>It was my first luxurious trip in my life.</i>

744
00:50:32,672 --> 00:50:34,977
NAGASAKI

745
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:38,640
<i>But for some reason, it was an empty journey.</i>

746
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:48,220
<i>I tried in that emptiness to forget
all the past and to love my husband.</i>

747
00:50:55,673 --> 00:50:58,220
ONE YEAR LATER

748
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,000
I was a little surprised when I
came across this when I was judging.

749
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:07,490
It's just so extraordinary.

750
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:09,250
Is this so extraordinary?

751
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,200
There are a lot of engineers,
but real architects are hard to find.

752
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,140
This Tateno fellow must be the real thing.

753
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:18,990
Are you going to appoint
this man to be in charge?

754
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:20,440
Yes, I would highly recommend him.

755
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:24,370
You're building a new building and
you're trying to develop your company,

756
00:51:24,830 --> 00:51:27,430
so we should let a man
of this caliber do the work.

757
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:29,710
Can you vouch for him?

758
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:31,710
I highly recommend him.

759
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:32,060
Very well.

760
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,100
- Yamana-kun.
- Yes.

761
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,090
- Call Niimura, the Deputy General Manager.

762
00:51:38,471 --> 00:51:39,090
Yes.

763
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:39,839
Yes, sir.

764
00:51:39,864 --> 00:51:45,370
To be honest with you, we've had a number of
meetings, and we couldn't come to a conclusion.

765
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:47,520
It's a very unusual architecture.

766
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,430
You're certainly right.

767
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,430
You're certainly right.

768
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:52,160
So I thought I'd go back to you, the expert,
and find out what you think, and then decide.

769
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:52,770
Come in.

770
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:56,890
It's about the design request.

771
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:59,390
I need you to negotiate with this man
to have him come to Tokyo right away.

772
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,390
I understand.

773
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:05,980
DESIGNER: YASUO TATENO, HOKKAIDO, JAPAN

774
00:52:07,347 --> 00:52:10,260
When are you going to Tokyo, brother?

775
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,520
Not yet.

776
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,290
Why?

777
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:14,950
They asked you to come right away, didn't they?

778
00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:15,570
But…

779
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,780
Why?

780
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,100
I really need you to go to Tokyo.

781
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:23,010
Why?

782
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,160
I thought I'd come with you.

783
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,894
I asked my uncle about it, and he said he was
worried about you going to Tokyo by yourself,

784
00:52:29,967 --> 00:52:32,520
so he asked me to go with you.

785
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,120
So let's go to Tokyo together.

786
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,230
Okay.

787
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:36,820
But.

788
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:41,100
I don't know anything about
anything but design, though.

789
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:42,790
It doesn't matter!

790
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,090
They asked you to design it for them.

791
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:47,170
So why don't you just go ahead and do it?

792
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,250
Yeah, I know, but I'm a little worried
about going to a big city like Tokyo.

793
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,990
You have no backbone for a guy.

794
00:52:55,990 --> 00:52:57,870
Don't worry, you have me.

795
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:04,040
And you always said you had
to thank my uncle for saving you.

796
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:04,890
Yeah.

797
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,830
So, you have to go to Tokyo and work, right?

798
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,620
Oh, you!

799
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:14,100
And besides, I have a grandfather in Tokyo.

800
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:18,200
I don't even know where he lives.

801
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,760
Excuse me, when are you coming home tonight?

802
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:22,720
I don't know.

803
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,980
After all, there are a lot of
invitations from vendors these days,

804
00:53:25,980 --> 00:53:27,980
If you're sleepy, just go to bed and wait.

805
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:29,700
No, it's okay.

806
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:37,390
Have a good day.

807
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:47,540
Do companies really have
parties every day like that?

808
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,226
I think there are a lot of
invitations from construction

809
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:52,570
companies because they're
building a new building.

810
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,040
You're a little too meek, ma'am.

811
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,860
Don't say such nonsense.

812
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:59,036
Oh.

813
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,190
What's this?

814
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,840
I found it the other day
when I cleaned out your room.

815
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:06,150
I thought you could still wear
it, so I took it to the cleaners.

816
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,900
It's an old sweater.

817
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:11,930
This is from my school days.

818
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:36,980
Miki-chan.

819
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:41,050
I'll give you that if you like.

820
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,560
What? You would like to give it to me?

821
00:54:42,850 --> 00:54:43,200
Yes.

822
00:54:45,570 --> 00:54:49,670
But it's old-fashioned, so you can send it
to your sister back in the country instead.

823
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:58,590
Hello? It's me.

824
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:01,440
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

825
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,170
Director.

826
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:05,730
The engineer from Hokkaido, Tateno, is here.

827
00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:06,860
Well, just in time.

828
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:07,840
Would you like to see him right away?

829
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,990
I'm going to go to a meeting with
Yasuda-san to discuss the engineer.

830
00:55:10,990 --> 00:55:12,390
I'm sorry, but you'll have to
go ahead and meet with him.

831
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:13,050
Yes, sir.

832
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,620
Brother.

833
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,630
How would you introduce me to everyone?

834
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:18,750
Right.

835
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:21,270
Can I just say you're my sister?

836
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,850
Good.

837
00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,790
- So then, it's not weird for me to call you big brother.
- Right.

838
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,680
Nice to meet you.

839
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:37,900
I'm Yasuo Tateno.

840
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,720
You…

841
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:41,340
You're…

842
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,500
I'm new to Tokyo,

843
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,010
and I can't walk around by
myself, so I brought my sister.

844
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:50,270
This is my sister, Chikako.

845
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:54,760
Are you really called Tateno?

846
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,190
Yes, I'm Tateno.

847
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,030
Um, are you feeling hot?

848
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:01,570
No.

849
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:03,894
But…

850
00:56:12,710 --> 00:56:14,830
There are so many cars in Tokyo.

851
00:56:16,370 --> 00:56:19,490
I can't walk the streets of Tokyo
without you with me, Chika-bo.

852
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,630
Don't worry, I won't leave you.

853
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,520
Do you know this area?

854
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,130
No.

855
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:31,580
But maybe I've been in
Tokyo more than I thought.

856
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,170
Here.

857
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:35,960
Thanks.

858
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:39,787
[INDISTINCT]

859
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:41,444
Welcome.

860
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:42,470
Hey.

861
00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:46,650
Since when do the guys from
Toyo Light Metal come to this place?

862
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,100
Well, it's just recently.

863
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:49,280
But they've been every night for a while now.

864
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:50,760
They said they were invited by the company.

865
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:54,910
Um, do you know that showy bastard
who's talking to Madam right now?

866
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:55,680
That one?

867
00:56:55,705 --> 00:56:57,085
It must be Sawano-san, the sales director.

868
00:56:57,570 --> 00:56:59,109
He has something with Midori-chan.

869
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:05,960
That's Yoko-san's husband.

870
00:57:06,016 --> 00:57:07,650
- What? Really?
- Yeah.

871
00:57:08,650 --> 00:57:12,210
No, Fujikawa-kun, you're the one who
will feel the most pain this time around.

872
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:12,800
What's that?

873
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,540
Yeah, I've commissioned
the design to someone else.

874
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:18,560
I'm very sorry about that.

875
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,080
You mean that Tateno guy
who won the competition.

876
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,720
Actually, we're looking forward
to seeing what it's going to be like.

877
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:24,390
But, Director.

878
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,380
I'm a little worried.

879
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:28,080
Are you sure about entrusting
this much work to such a young man?

880
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:30,210
You always say the same thing, don't you?

881
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:33,620
Anyway, does he know about this place?

882
00:57:34,268 --> 00:57:35,090
He's late.

883
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:39,070
He doesn't know Tokyo, so I gave
some directions to the girl that's with him.

884
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:40,520
That's a bit unreliable.

885
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,720
Why don't you at least make a phone call?

886
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,850
Do you know the hotel he's staying?

887
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,490
Some kind of hotel in Nippori.

888
00:57:46,490 --> 00:57:47,840
Then I'll make a call.

889
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:53,180
Thank you for your patience.

890
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:55,510
Everybody's quiet today.

891
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,170
Midori-chan.

892
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,300
I feel bad for the Director's wife.

893
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,210
I heard something.

894
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,480
I heard that you had a great
love marriage, didn't you, Director?

895
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,076
- Who told you that?
- Oh, my goodness! It's well-known.

896
00:58:06,610 --> 00:58:11,980
I heard a rumor that the wife fell
in love with the Director,

897
00:58:12,004 --> 00:58:14,870
chased him around, and forced him to
marry her even though he didn't want to.

898
00:58:15,870 --> 00:58:16,854
Well.

899
00:58:17,590 --> 00:58:18,240
Am I wrong?

900
00:58:18,850 --> 00:58:20,030
Huh? Wait.

901
00:58:20,510 --> 00:58:21,690
Maybe it was the other way around.

902
00:58:22,810 --> 00:58:23,580
I'm sorry.

903
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,230
Welcome.

904
00:58:31,052 --> 00:58:32,310
Ah, welcome.

905
00:58:32,310 --> 00:58:33,760
Please, come in.

906
00:58:34,230 --> 00:58:35,040
Is something wrong?

907
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,220
What?

908
00:58:36,568 --> 00:58:37,147
It's nothing.

909
00:58:37,537 --> 00:58:38,820
You were very late.

910
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:40,190
Everyone's been waiting for you.

911
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:40,640
Go ahead.

912
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,420
Well, gentlemen, I'd like
to introduce him to you.

913
00:58:43,420 --> 00:58:45,660
This is Yasuo Tateno-kun.

914
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,330
Nice to meet you.

915
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:47,690
I'm Tateno.

916
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,880
And this is Yasuda, general
manager of Uchiyama Construction.

917
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:52,520
Sakurai-san.

918
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:53,720
Fujikawa-san, the designer.

919
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:55,450
I'm Fujikawa.

920
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,590
Please sit down.

921
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:01,630
No need to be shy. They're all very friendly.

922
00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:03,450
- Excuse me.
- Please.

923
00:59:04,910 --> 00:59:05,940
Excuse me.

924
00:59:07,740 --> 00:59:09,380
I'm Chikako.

925
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,040
Pleased to meet you.

926
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:14,590
Excuse me. I completely forgot.

927
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:15,650
Come on, sit down.

928
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:17,680
Ah, there you go.

929
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:22,810
Oh, my! Sugano-san!

930
00:59:27,116 --> 00:59:28,450
Sugano-san!

931
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:30,080
I'm not dreaming, am I?

932
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,590
Sugano-san.

933
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:33,250
And you are? My name is Tateno.

934
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:34,560
What?

935
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:35,040
Tateno?

936
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,440
Sugano?

937
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:41,280
I even mistook you for someone named Sugano.

938
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:44,690
Well, it's rare to find someone
who looks so much alike.

939
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:45,340
Right?

940
00:59:45,340 --> 00:59:47,580
What? Yeah.

941
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,030
Hey, just keep bringing the beers.

942
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:50,360
Yes, sir.

943
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:55,710
Excuse me, where is your hometown, Mr. Tateno?

944
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,430
It's Hokkaido, Japan.

945
00:59:58,620 --> 00:59:59,930
Which part of Hokkaido is it?

946
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:01,540
Hokkaido's…

947
01:00:02,925 --> 01:00:05,950
Actually, I kind of forgot.

948
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:07,850
Brother.

949
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:08,890
Your head hurts, doesn't it?

950
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:10,810
Don't try to remember.

951
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,810
Are you ill or something?

952
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:14,720
No, it's not like that.

953
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:20,170
Excuse me.

954
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:20,880
Call the cab!

955
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,880
- Aya-chan! Call a cab!
- Come on!

956
01:00:25,670 --> 01:00:26,396
Are you okay?

957
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:28,590
When I say this in front of
my brother, he gets mad at me.

958
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,570
I want you to understand.

959
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:34,970
My brother has amnesia.

960
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:36,800
Amnesia?

961
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:41,820
He was drowned in a river, and he was rescued,
but he doesn't remember anything before that.

962
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:46,160
So don't remind him too much of his past.

963
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:47,950
He's in so much pain.

964
01:00:48,670 --> 01:00:50,670
- They're here for you.
- Yes.

965
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,670
- Let's go.
- Are you okay?

966
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,670
- Hold on. Are you okay?
- Let's go.

967
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,230
Are you okay?

968
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:58,320
Be careful. Are you okay, Sugano-san?

969
01:00:58,345 --> 01:00:59,406
Goodbye!

970
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:04,910
Sugano… Sugano, huh?

971
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,640
I said I'd give it to you, but
I didn't tell you to wear it.

972
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,330
I told you to give it to your sister.

973
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:13,649
But I was just trying it on for a bit.

974
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:14,660
I don't want you to wear it,
even for a little bit.

975
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,970
I don't want you to wear it in front of me.

976
01:01:17,970 --> 01:01:18,950
Don't you get it?

977
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:20,220
Yes.

978
01:01:20,730 --> 01:01:21,730
Yoko-san, a moment.

979
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:23,070
Yes.

980
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,290
Don't scold your maid for trivial matters.

981
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:32,010
You're not used to a maid, so you wouldn't
understand, but we're short on them right now.

982
01:01:32,010 --> 01:01:32,710
I understand.

983
01:01:33,390 --> 01:01:34,270
What happened to Shinsuke?

984
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:36,890
He said he was having a banquet at work.

985
01:01:36,890 --> 01:01:38,060
Ah, I see.

986
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:39,910
Yoko-san, do you believe that he has a banquet?

987
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,730
When we were young,

988
01:01:43,730 --> 01:01:46,210
they used to say it was the wife's
fault if her husband came home late.

989
01:01:46,590 --> 01:01:47,440
And even tonight…

990
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,000
He's early…

991
01:01:52,830 --> 01:01:53,980
Yoko, look.

992
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:56,960
How's that? It won the first prize.

993
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,150
Yoko, do you get it?

994
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:05,370
I don't know, but I think it's wonderful.

995
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,780
What's so great about it?

996
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,650
It's such a bizarre building.

997
01:02:10,310 --> 01:02:13,950
I guess you know a lot more about architecture.

998
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:15,710
All right.

999
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:20,800
I'll take you to see the guy named
Tateno who drew this next time.

1000
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,140
What?

1001
01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:22,940
Why would you do that?

1002
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,010
That's right.

1003
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:26,700
I'm inviting him home this Sunday.

1004
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,500
I'll show you the genius' face once.

1005
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:34,880
He's from Hokkaido.

1006
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:46,600
So, your real name is Sugano.

1007
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:47,800
No, it's not.

1008
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,900
I've never heard that name before.

1009
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:57,310
But the name Tateno was chosen by a doctor.

1010
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:00,480
The doctor when he saved you from the river.

1011
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:03,975
Sugano…

1012
01:03:04,210 --> 01:03:05,190
Sugano…

1013
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:07,920
I don't know it at all.

1014
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:10,270
My head…

1015
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,910
Sorry, I shouldn't have
made you try to remember.

1016
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:20,740
Your head hurts sometimes
more than it used to these days.

1017
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:25,120
Oh, Yoko.

1018
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:26,430
Hey…

1019
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:27,040
What is it?

1020
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:30,690
There's something I need to tell you.

1021
01:03:30,690 --> 01:03:32,030
What on earth are you talking about?

1022
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:34,620
Actually…

1023
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:37,050
Calm down and listen to me.

1024
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,520
You're overreacting, Brother.

1025
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,940
It's about the man who's invited today…

1026
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,370
Tateno-san, the architect?

1027
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:48,190
I'm off to the main house to say hello.

1028
01:03:48,570 --> 01:03:48,830
Yeah.

1029
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:51,360
The thing is…

1030
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,450
What's wrong?

1031
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,170
He's Sugano-kun.

1032
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,250
What?

1033
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,850
Mitsuharu Sugano.

1034
01:04:03,610 --> 01:04:04,050
Yoko!

1035
01:04:04,596 --> 01:04:06,737
Steady!

1036
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:09,860
Well, that's very kind of you.

1037
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:11,950
I'm not sure if it will suit your palate.

1038
01:04:12,330 --> 01:04:14,680
I know Yoko is always so clumsy.

1039
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:17,210
No, she works quite well.

1040
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,950
She can't compete with a young
lady who grew up in our society.

1041
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:23,770
It's because everyone is so mild-mannered.

1042
01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:34,820
I'm worried about what would happen
if you guys suddenly met each other.

1043
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,060
I thought I should let you
know as soon as possible.

1044
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,350
Mitsuharu-san.

1045
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:40,480
He's alive?

1046
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,810
Sawano-san is a terrible person.

1047
01:04:42,810 --> 01:04:45,180
I can't believe he knew that and went
to the trouble of inviting him to his house.

1048
01:04:46,210 --> 01:04:47,670
What is Mitsuharu-san thinking…

1049
01:04:48,450 --> 01:04:50,270
Sugano-san has lost his memory.

1050
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,050
Memory?

1051
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,550
He forgot about you too, of course.

1052
01:04:54,550 --> 01:05:01,070
Or maybe he'll remember
the old days when he sees you.

1053
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:05,650
Oh.

1054
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:07,570
Thank you for inviting me today.

1055
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:09,560
Please come on in.

1056
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:11,800
I think it's about time.

1057
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,050
Ah, yes.

1058
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,530
Please.

1059
01:05:15,230 --> 01:05:15,900
Yoko!

1060
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:17,870
Yoko!

1061
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:18,750
What's wrong?

1062
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:29,480
What's wrong, Yoko-san?

1063
01:05:29,970 --> 01:05:30,910
Are you sick?

1064
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,790
No, I'm not.

1065
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:38,940
It must be Tateno-kun.

1066
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:46,080
Yoko-san.

1067
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:47,230
Welcome him at the door.

1068
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:00,040
Good afternoon.

1069
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,480
Um, I'm here on behalf of my brother.

1070
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:05,460
Oh, it's you.

1071
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:11,290
What happened to Tateno-kun?

1072
01:06:11,290 --> 01:06:12,430
Uh…

1073
01:06:12,430 --> 01:06:16,290
I'm terribly sorry, but he had a
sudden headache since this morning.

1074
01:06:16,700 --> 01:06:17,920
He couldn't come here.

1075
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:21,690
So he told me to say hello
to the Director and everyone.

1076
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,320
Does his head hurt that bad?

1077
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:25,380
It's terrible.

1078
01:06:25,380 --> 01:06:27,100
I feel so sorry for him,
I can't even look at him.

1079
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:27,710
Really?

1080
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,360
Um, I'm worried about him, so I'm leaving.

1081
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:32,800
Goodbye!

1082
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:38,200
Oh dear, I even changed my clothes.

1083
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:39,930
Yoko-san, please help me.

1084
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:41,210
Yes.

1085
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:44,930
He's certainly a troublemaker.

1086
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,340
Especially since you took
the trouble to invite him.

1087
01:06:46,340 --> 01:06:47,650
You told Yoko.

1088
01:06:47,886 --> 01:06:49,030
What?

1089
01:06:49,030 --> 01:06:50,140
About Tateno-kun, I mean.

1090
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:51,650
Mitsuharu Sugano.

1091
01:06:52,130 --> 01:06:53,530
I'm sorry.

1092
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:56,330
I was going to test her feelings.

1093
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:59,580
If she still can't forget him,
I'd be worried as her husband.

1094
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,300
I'm very sorry.

1095
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,730
Niimura-kun!

1096
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:05,530
Why didn't you tell me?

1097
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:07,470
That Tateno is Sugano!

1098
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:08,570
Um…

1099
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,570
If you're like that, there are
going to be problems.

1100
01:07:10,570 --> 01:07:12,190
I'm sorry.

1101
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:13,590
Can you remember?

1102
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:17,290
I'm a friend of yours from school.

1103
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,580
Her name is Toki-san.

1104
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,390
Toki-san.

1105
01:07:23,370 --> 01:07:26,980
She's the one who was there for you
and used to take care of your injuries.

1106
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:29,850
I don't know.

1107
01:07:31,510 --> 01:07:33,130
I've never seen any of you…

1108
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:34,850
It's okay.

1109
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,120
I'll get some fresh air in.

1110
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:51,000
Anyway, let's have a doctor
take a look at you once.

1111
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:57,930
Oh, welcome back.

1112
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,060
Who are you?

1113
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:08,410
Ah, she's a friend of Tateno-san.

1114
01:08:08,410 --> 01:08:08,620
Okay.

1115
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,120
Finally, someone to take care of you.

1116
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:13,200
Chika-bo.

1117
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:16,410
Don't say that.

1118
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:18,480
They went out of their way to pay me a visit.

1119
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:20,480
I know, I know.

1120
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,290
(BABBLES): I can take care of him too.

1121
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:33,570
I can't say for sure until I examine him,
but he probably has a hematoma in his brain.

1122
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:34,560
Hematoma?

1123
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:35,810
Yes.

1124
01:08:36,700 --> 01:08:40,230
He has a chronic subdural hematoma due
to injuries sustained when he fell off a cliff.

1125
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:47,130
So he could have a bag of blood, and the
pressure of the bag could be causing amnesia.

1126
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,720
If that's the case, it can be cured by surgery.

1127
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,640
That surgery is hard, isn't it?

1128
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:57,320
Of course, it's hard, because
you're opening up the brain.

1129
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:58,940
You're going to open the brain?

1130
01:08:59,390 --> 01:08:59,910
Yes.

1131
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,640
But it's even more dangerous
to leave it as it is now.

1132
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,120
I think you need to get
checked out as soon as possible.

1133
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:10,810
Where is she?

1134
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,910
She said she wanted to visit a friend.

1135
01:09:13,910 --> 01:09:14,560
Her friend?

1136
01:09:14,970 --> 01:09:15,620
What friend?

1137
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:17,060
I don't know.

1138
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,700
You should at least ask where she's going.

1139
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:19,810
I'm going out.

1140
01:09:20,380 --> 01:09:21,520
Where are you going?

1141
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,900
I can go anywhere I want.

1142
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,340
This is the room.

1143
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,238
Who are you?

1144
01:10:23,450 --> 01:10:23,860
Yes?

1145
01:10:24,860 --> 01:10:26,860
Mitsuharu-san.

1146
01:10:27,421 --> 01:10:28,860
Mitsuharu?

1147
01:10:28,860 --> 01:10:30,290
Who is that?

1148
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,360
My name is Yasuo Tateno.

1149
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:42,240
Some people call me by different
names, but…I don't remember any of them.

1150
01:10:42,240 --> 01:10:45,120
I don't even know anyone named Mitsuharu.

1151
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:52,290
Who are you and what do you want?

1152
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:53,760
I am…

1153
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,110
I'm Sawano's wife.

1154
01:10:57,810 --> 01:10:58,490
I came to visit you.

1155
01:11:00,910 --> 01:11:01,760
Yoko-san.

1156
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:08,900
Who are you?

1157
01:11:09,590 --> 01:11:10,590
Take it to your brother.

1158
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:11,590
Yeah.

1159
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:21,570
Toki-san… Maybe I shouldn't have come…

1160
01:11:23,340 --> 01:11:24,700
Thank you for coming.

1161
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:29,120
So he couldn't recognize you either.

1162
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:31,930
How ill is he?

1163
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,050
It's very bad.

1164
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:37,250
If we leave it alone as it is
now, his nerves will be damaged…

1165
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:40,760
Yoko-san.

1166
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,470
What if you took him?

1167
01:11:47,140 --> 01:11:49,850
To somewhere memorable.

1168
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:53,120
Maybe then he'll remember a few things.

1169
01:12:06,710 --> 01:12:09,210
I hate noisy places like this.

1170
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:13,180
What's this room?

1171
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:16,190
Toki-san has been using
this room for a long time.

1172
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:19,350
She just vacated her room yesterday.

1173
01:12:23,030 --> 01:12:23,450
Go ahead.

1174
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:24,850
Tateno-san.

1175
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:45,890
What is this room…?

1176
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:49,120
This is the room Mitsuharu-san used to live in.

1177
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:03,510
It's a sketch.

1178
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,670
Yes, it's a sketch.

1179
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:34,850
You're…

1180
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:38,850
Do you remember?

1181
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:42,850
Who are you?

1182
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:44,610
I'm Yoko.

1183
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:46,610
Yoko-san.

1184
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,590
Please remember.

1185
01:13:50,590 --> 01:13:51,520
I'm Yoko.

1186
01:13:52,300 --> 01:13:54,620
You've uttered this name many times.

1187
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,730
I also called you Mitsuharu-san.

1188
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,720
Mitsuharu-san, it's me, Yoko.

1189
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,620
I was your fiancee.

1190
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:07,310
Fiancee?

1191
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:10,210
Yes, I was your fiancee.

1192
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:12,210
I was your lover.

1193
01:14:16,004 --> 01:14:17,190
I see.

1194
01:14:17,190 --> 01:14:17,930
Did you understand?

1195
01:14:24,790 --> 01:14:26,140
Please remember me!

1196
01:14:27,590 --> 01:14:30,500
I'm… I'm Yoko.

1197
01:14:32,500 --> 01:14:34,490
Or maybe it was really so.

1198
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:38,530
Maybe I had a girlfriend too.

1199
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:43,650
Maybe it was you.

1200
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:45,310
It's true.

1201
01:14:45,310 --> 01:14:46,230
It's true!

1202
01:14:47,870 --> 01:14:49,530
Please stop it already!

1203
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:54,930
I can't even remember my girlfriend.

1204
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,920
No matter how many
times you say that…I can't…

1205
01:15:04,190 --> 01:15:05,450
I want to believe you, but I can't.

1206
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:15,810
Please don't cry so much.

1207
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,950
I think I know how you feel.

1208
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,150
But!

1209
01:15:26,530 --> 01:15:28,317
Because I can't remember you,

1210
01:15:29,274 --> 01:15:30,450
I'm in more pain.

1211
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:35,680
No one can understand this suffering.

1212
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,375
Can't you understand?

1213
01:15:56,810 --> 01:15:59,010
I didn't want to lie to you.

1214
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:02,240
I'm asking you why you went there.

1215
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:05,530
I went to visit him because of his illness.

1216
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,500
Fine.

1217
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:10,620
I'll be quiet just for today.

1218
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,650
But I will never allow you to see Sugano again.

1219
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:16,700
But he's sick.

1220
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:17,640
What's wrong with visiting a sick person?

1221
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,780
That's enough!

1222
01:16:20,530 --> 01:16:22,430
You're my wife.

1223
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,620
If my own wife goes to see her old lover, you
want me, the husband, to pretend I don't know?

1224
01:16:27,770 --> 01:16:30,170
I'm not that forgiving!

1225
01:16:32,890 --> 01:16:35,330
Ma'am, there's a call for you
from someone named Fujikawa-san.

1226
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,150
He's been in a bad way since you left.

1227
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:42,370
He's just been admitted to the hospital.

1228
01:16:42,590 --> 01:16:44,710
He's sleeping from an injection right now.

1229
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:45,940
I hate to break it to you,

1230
01:16:45,964 --> 01:16:49,600
but he shouldn't have strained so much
trying to regain his memory during the day.

1231
01:16:52,610 --> 01:16:53,250
Hello?

1232
01:16:54,210 --> 01:16:55,870
They're going to operate
on him in a couple of days.

1233
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,720
The doctor says there's nothing to worry about.

1234
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:01,010
I'm going to the hospital right now.

1235
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,910
No, even if you come
now, Sugano is just sleeping.

1236
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:07,000
You're in a difficult position with Sawano-san.

1237
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,370
I'll get back to you when
the surgery date is set.

1238
01:17:09,370 --> 01:17:11,458
Please don't worry too much and wait.

1239
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:15,740
Is it about Sugano?

1240
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:19,390
Okay, you can go visit him if you want.

1241
01:17:20,500 --> 01:17:22,010
I've said all I have to say.

1242
01:17:31,402 --> 01:17:35,495
JUNE 17: SURGERY APPOINTMENT
MITSUHARU SUGANO, AGE 26, SUBARACHNOID HEMATOMA

1243
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,150
Brother.

1244
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,450
They said the surgery is easy.

1245
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:39,600
It doesn't hurt at all.

1246
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:41,130
- Really?
- Yeah.

1247
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,010
I'm so relieved, Brother.

1248
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,460
Everything is going to be back to normal.

1249
01:17:46,020 --> 01:17:47,230
It's wonderful.

1250
01:17:48,090 --> 01:17:49,440
Everything, huh?

1251
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,110
That's right!

1252
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:57,150
Sorry everyone, but can you
give me a moment alone with Toki-san?

1253
01:17:59,370 --> 01:18:00,290
Okay, let's go.

1254
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:03,170
Me too?

1255
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:05,520
I'm sorry.

1256
01:18:05,520 --> 01:18:06,110
Chika-bo.

1257
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:11,580
I'm here for Yasuo Tateno-san
who's here for surgery.

1258
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:12,190
Doctor!

1259
01:18:14,170 --> 01:18:15,560
I was worried about the surgery.

1260
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:16,870
Thank you.

1261
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,490
Sugano is happy that so many
people are concerned about him.

1262
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:24,900
Toki-san.

1263
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:29,510
I can't stand such anxious feelings anymore.

1264
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:31,453
But…

1265
01:18:33,390 --> 01:18:37,310
I don't know what it means
to get my memory back…

1266
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:39,310
It's okay.

1267
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,370
You don't have to think about that now.

1268
01:18:42,190 --> 01:18:42,510
Right?

1269
01:18:44,610 --> 01:18:45,910
That Yoko-san…

1270
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,080
She said she was my fiancee.

1271
01:18:50,510 --> 01:18:54,240
And you were my friend.

1272
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:57,760
Mitsuharu-san.

1273
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,760
Mitsuharu Sugano.

1274
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:06,928
I wonder what I used to think about Yoko-san…

1275
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:14,360
I'm worried that my regaining my
memory will make her unhappy…

1276
01:19:16,020 --> 01:19:18,140
And Toki-san.

1277
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,140
I don't know what I thought about you.

1278
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:25,840
That's…

1279
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:34,780
Even if I could go back to Mitsuharu
Sugano… I doubt anyone would be happy.

1280
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:49,370
It's almost time for the surgery.

1281
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:01,350
Yoko.

1282
01:20:01,350 --> 01:20:01,940
I knew it!

1283
01:20:16,390 --> 01:20:17,370
You're here too?

1284
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:14,420
How's it going?

1285
01:21:15,055 --> 01:21:16,255
Everything is good.

1286
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:17,020
Good work.

1287
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:17,960
Okay.

1288
01:21:19,018 --> 01:21:21,410
You! Why did you sneak out to come here?

1289
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:22,560
Why did you do such a crazy thing!

1290
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,490
If you don't act more
carefully, you're in big trouble.

1291
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:29,600
You are Shinsuke Sawano's wife.

1292
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,070
Yoko!

1293
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:39,370
I'm getting a lot of grief from
Sawano-san about Sugano right now.

1294
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:40,930
You should understand my position a little.

1295
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,950
No, for your sake, you'd
better go home quickly.

1296
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:44,906
Mitsuharu-san is in the middle of surgery!

1297
01:21:44,931 --> 01:21:45,720
I know.

1298
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,370
I hear there is nothing to worry about.

1299
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,090
The results of the surgery--

1300
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,050
Brother!

1301
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,206
Why, Brother!

1302
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:53,820
I know my position.

1303
01:21:53,820 --> 01:21:58,370
But Brother, is it wrong for me to
worry about Mitsuharu-san's illness?

1304
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:59,130
Niimura-san.

1305
01:21:59,130 --> 01:22:01,690
Why don't you let Yoko-san stay?

1306
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:07,510
But this is not your problem.

1307
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:08,320
Maybe you're right.

1308
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:11,980
But even you have no right to
meddle in Yoko-san's love affairs.

1309
01:22:11,980 --> 01:22:13,830
I, as the older brother--

1310
01:22:13,830 --> 01:22:14,880
Niimura-san.

1311
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,840
We're all here because we're
all concerned about Sugano-kun.

1312
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,100
I wouldn't want anyone else to be here.

1313
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:22,680
I agree.

1314
01:22:22,680 --> 01:22:24,400
Even Yoko-san is not a child.

1315
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,290
I think she came here after
giving it a lot of thought.

1316
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:27,810
Right?

1317
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:34,190
If you worry more, she'll misunderstand
you, even if you're her brother.

1318
01:22:34,190 --> 01:22:35,300
Don't worry about it.

1319
01:22:35,690 --> 01:22:37,850
You must be busy with at the company.

1320
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,450
Yoko-san.

1321
01:22:56,860 --> 01:22:59,910
I'm worried about you in a
different way than your brother.

1322
01:23:01,150 --> 01:23:04,030
I'm sure you've given this a lot
of thought before you came here.

1323
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:11,130
I can't think about anything right now.

1324
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,072
All I can think about is
Mitsuharu-san's recovery.

1325
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:17,380
I see.

1326
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,070
All I want is for Mitsuharu-san
to remember the old days.

1327
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:25,150
That's all I think about.

1328
01:23:25,290 --> 01:23:26,760
If only he could remember the old days…

1329
01:23:29,650 --> 01:23:30,190
I…

1330
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:30,970
I…

1331
01:23:38,976 --> 01:23:39,750
Give me the electrocautery.

1332
01:23:54,700 --> 01:23:55,496
The drill.

1333
01:24:27,990 --> 01:24:29,010
Speed up the blood transfusions.

1334
01:24:29,010 --> 01:24:30,010
Yes.

1335
01:24:34,740 --> 01:24:35,240
How's his blood pressure?

1336
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:36,800
It's a little lower.

1337
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:37,823
The cannula.

1338
01:25:35,070 --> 01:25:35,420
Wipe my sweat.

1339
01:27:41,450 --> 01:27:42,700
Ah, how was it?

1340
01:27:43,130 --> 01:27:44,220
How did the surgery go?

1341
01:27:44,220 --> 01:27:47,860
They're not done yet, but he's okay now.

1342
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:50,480
They are just about to give him his
last skin protection and transfusion.

1343
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:57,790
Hey.

1344
01:27:57,790 --> 01:27:58,880
Why are you leaving?

1345
01:28:00,060 --> 01:28:01,740
It would be better if I wasn't here.

1346
01:28:01,740 --> 01:28:02,960
Why?

1347
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:04,000
Why?

1348
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:07,780
I don't know what to say.

1349
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,080
Your brother will be as good as ever, right?

1350
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:12,780
Mm-hmm.

1351
01:28:13,780 --> 01:28:14,923
So…

1352
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:18,020
I think your brother would be
confused with me being around.

1353
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:19,170
Why?

1354
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:19,870
I don't understand.

1355
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,190
I'm not sure how to say it.

1356
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:26,290
I mean, I think your brother
would find me annoying.

1357
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:27,560
Really?

1358
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:30,420
Got it?

1359
01:28:31,560 --> 01:28:33,380
Yeah, a little bit.

1360
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,970
You don't need to get it.

1361
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:37,550
Okay then.

1362
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:40,580
See you soon.

1363
01:28:42,910 --> 01:28:44,580
Hey!

1364
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,550
You're a good person.

1365
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:53,900
Thank you.

1366
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:58,100
Chika-bo!

1367
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:02,800
Next time, I'll look for
your grandpa with you.

1368
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
Yeah.

1369
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:08,800
Goodbye.

1370
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:10,800
Goodbye!

1371
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:18,800
Goodbye!

1372
01:29:23,560 --> 01:29:25,080
The hematoma has been completely removed.

1373
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:26,670
There is no need to worry anymore.

1374
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:28,750
And how about his memory?

1375
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:33,200
Yeah, if it's caused by a hematoma,
I think his memory will return.

1376
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:35,290
So it might not come back in some cases?

1377
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:40,080
It's hard to say, but if it's due to other
causes, for example, psychological shock.

1378
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:43,880
Anyway, we won't know
until he regains consciousness.

1379
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,980
I'm worried about something.

1380
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:01,270
What is it?

1381
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:02,780
You know what?

1382
01:30:03,370 --> 01:30:06,590
When my brother remembers the old days…

1383
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:07,460
Yeah.

1384
01:30:07,460 --> 01:30:12,400
He's going to forget what happened
during the time he didn't remember, right?

1385
01:30:13,332 --> 01:30:14,690
Well, I guess so.

1386
01:30:16,347 --> 01:30:19,510
So what about me?

1387
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:20,460
Hmmm…

1388
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,240
I wonder how that will turn out.

1389
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:23,870
Well, don't worry about it.

1390
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:25,510
I'll find your grandpa.

1391
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:29,510
You all say the same thing.

1392
01:30:29,510 --> 01:30:32,510
You have no idea how I feel.

1393
01:30:32,535 --> 01:30:35,535
If my brother forgets, I'm on my own.

1394
01:30:54,490 --> 01:30:57,250
Yoko-san…

1395
01:31:03,230 --> 01:31:03,948
Yoko.

1396
01:31:13,287 --> 01:31:14,311
Yoko.

1397
01:31:59,646 --> 01:32:06,320
THE END

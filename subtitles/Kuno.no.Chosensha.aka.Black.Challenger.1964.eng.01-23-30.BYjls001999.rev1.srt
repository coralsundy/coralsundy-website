00:00:38,287 --> 00:00:41,115
Hey you!
I will definitely give birth to a baby

3
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,508
Darling...

4
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:12,719
Darling...

5
00:02:45,597 --> 00:02:53,909
Black challenger

6
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,524
Thank you very much tonight

7
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:56,242
Anniversary of the founding of Nango Law Office

8
00:05:56,508 --> 00:05:59,445
Thank you to everyone who has taken care of us on a daily basis.

9
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,828
We are very happy to have a party with you

10
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,711
I think it is time to close our party

11
00:06:10,063 --> 00:06:11,750
Thank you very much

12
00:06:11,953 --> 00:06:13,344
Thank you very much everyone

13
00:06:13,617 --> 00:06:14,563
It's still early

14
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:17,406
Everyone, I'm dissatisfied

15
00:06:18,438 --> 00:06:21,133
Nango-kun.
It is wonderful tonight

16
00:06:21,516 --> 00:06:22,547
Wine,music

17
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,047
And there are beautiful girls too

18
00:06:25,516 --> 00:06:27,250
We are in good mood

19
00:06:28,452 --> 00:06:35,835
I have a long relationship with you, having been your legal counsel since your father's time.

20
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,930
Mr.Kotaro Minami, Doctor of Law

21
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:41,266
He was a good lawyer

22
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:46,438
I was very disappointed when he died

23
00:06:47,128 --> 00:06:52,355
But his son has become a lawyer as great as his dad

24
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:57,816
In a sense,He is a lawyer who is more modern than his father

25
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:00,269
His brains, his energy.

26
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,753
He is more handsome than dad

27
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:07,777
Well...The problem is from here

28
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,191
This is my complaint

29
00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:14,206
Nango-kun,
Why are you still single?

30
00:07:14,675 --> 00:07:15,495
That's right

31
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:22,902
I represent a bar owner in Ginza.
I strongly agree with that opinion

32
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,878
Mr.Nango

33
00:07:25,425 --> 00:07:27,410
Do you have someone you love?

34
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:28,886
Say it!

35
00:07:31,402 --> 00:07:33,628
We are the Metropolitan Police Department Investigation Division 1

36
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,136
I have known him for 8 years

37
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,597
I did his investigation

38
00:07:42,019 --> 00:07:46,253
Unfortunately there is no such woman at this time

39
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:49,238
Damn it!

40
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:50,722
How dare of you

41
00:07:51,058 --> 00:07:58,070
There is also information that he has a love for his assistant, Kyoko Kanamaru.

42
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:03,461
There is also information that Kyoko also loves him

43
00:08:07,633 --> 00:08:08,633
Hey you!

44
00:08:08,984 --> 00:08:10,421
That’s enough!

45
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:14,813
Thank you all for late

46
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:25,414
Congratulations

47
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:26,617
Thanks

48
00:08:30,867 --> 00:08:31,703
I'm leaving now

49
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,883
You can stay

50
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,672
I will see you at office again.
Good night

51
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:36,789
I forgot to say

52
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,727
This is tonight's reward

53
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:40,680
Here it is

54
00:08:41,844 --> 00:08:42,696
Can I open it?

55
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,273
Sure

56
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,071
Wow! wonderful!

57
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:55,414
I'm glad!

58
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:40,845
Just let me have one more drink, please.

59
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,728
Hello?
Is Mr.Nango in?

60
00:09:55,064 --> 00:09:55,970
It's me

61
00:09:56,119 --> 00:09:57,689
Can you help me please?

62
00:09:58,236 --> 00:09:59,588
Can you come right away?

63
00:09:59,806 --> 00:10:02,791
I will ask for the case tomorrow at the Ginza office

64
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:06,595
It must be tonight.
Right now...

65
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,033
If so, can you come here?

66
00:10:08,181 --> 00:10:09,517
I can't move

67
00:10:10,197 --> 00:10:11,580
Can you help me please?

68
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:13,845
It ’s a murder case.

69
00:10:14,627 --> 00:10:16,095
I am not the murder

70
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:17,463
Did you report the police?

71
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:18,791
Not yet

72
00:10:19,033 --> 00:10:19,838
Because I was...

73
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,759
I get it. so what's your name?

74
00:10:22,369 --> 00:10:23,439
Fumie Tono

75
00:10:24,838 --> 00:10:25,650
Can you come here soon?

76
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:27,642
I am scared

77
00:10:27,736 --> 00:10:28,666
Hello?

78
00:10:29,119 --> 00:10:29,728
Hello?

79
00:10:30,994 --> 00:10:31,634
Hello?

80
00:10:32,994 --> 00:10:33,642
Can you come here soon?

81
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:35,478
I can't stand anymore

82
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:39,134
I can't breathe

83
00:10:39,658 --> 00:10:40,705
I will go there soon

84
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:41,830
Where are you now?

85
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:42,900
What?

86
00:10:43,845 --> 00:10:44,619
Ochanomizu?

87
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:45,736
I see

88
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:46,588
OK

89
00:10:47,611 --> 00:10:48,002
I got it

90
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:11,689
Hey you!

91
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:13,939
What's wrong?
Hey!

92
00:11:14,642 --> 00:11:15,838
Are you Ok?

93
00:11:17,634 --> 00:11:19,080
Hey you!

94
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,816
Nango-san,
Can you come soon?

95
00:12:21,121 --> 00:12:22,542
That's too bad

96
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:25,871
She was 5 months pregnant and it was too late

97
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,261
She had terrible internal bleeding

98
00:12:27,535 --> 00:12:28,363
Was she pregnant?

99
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:33,347
The placenta usually comes off after the child is born

100
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:36,019
Peeling before birth is called premature peeling.

101
00:12:36,535 --> 00:12:37,863
This is very dangerous

102
00:12:38,496 --> 00:12:39,199
What is the reason?

103
00:12:39,816 --> 00:12:42,003
She hit her hips hard

104
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:45,089
She was kicked by someone?

105
00:12:45,605 --> 00:12:47,863
I think it's her fault

106
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:50,402
It's snowing so she may have slipped and fell

107
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,448
So..She's not a suspicious death

108
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:53,996
Well..kind of

109
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,707
I'm sorry to ask you but What kind of relationship do you have with her?

110
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:58,519
I am the client of the case

111
00:12:58,597 --> 00:12:59,167
I see

112
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:00,417
Then

113
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:01,449
Thank you

114
00:13:11,042 --> 00:13:12,441
I feel sorry for her.

115
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:15,683
I should have come little earlier

116
00:13:38,347 --> 00:13:40,511
Ah,Ita-cho,I want to ask you something

117
00:13:41,035 --> 00:13:41,957
Listen to me

118
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,761
Now a young woman died in the hospital

119
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:46,558
Her name is Fumie Tono

120
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:48,862
Will you investigate the hotel in Ochanomizu?

121
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:51,964
I think it's a murder case

122
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,527
Then I'm counting on you

123
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:01,957
Good morning

124
00:14:02,082 --> 00:14:02,542
Good morning

125
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:04,277
Thank you for your hard work last night

126
00:14:05,167 --> 00:14:06,292
Did the Ita-cho contact me?

127
00:14:06,457 --> 00:14:07,488
He said he want you call him back

128
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,058
I see

129
00:14:23,113 --> 00:14:25,472
Hello, this is Nango Law Office

130
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,214
Is Itatsu-department chief in?

131
00:14:28,472 --> 00:14:28,988
Yes

132
00:14:30,386 --> 00:14:32,863
I see, I get it, Thank you

133
00:14:33,441 --> 00:14:34,011
He is absent?

134
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:34,652
Yes

135
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:36,433
He's on site.

136
00:14:36,557 --> 00:14:36,987
Where?

137
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,683
Here it is

138
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,566
Eiraku?

139
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:48,550
You know what.
It's the hotel's responsibility if the car is destroyed in the hotel parking lot, isn't it?

140
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:52,691
I know that,
but your car's doors and antennas are not broken

141
00:14:53,105 --> 00:14:54,433
The roof of the car is just dented

142
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:59,792
You know what.
My car is cheap but the roof doesn't dent due to the snow last night

143
00:15:00,207 --> 00:15:01,457
Someone dropped the flowerpot from the hotel

144
00:15:01,816 --> 00:15:03,933
Flowerpots are not on the balcony

145
00:15:04,363 --> 00:15:05,863
Please reimburse anyway

146
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:33,300
What? There is No dead body?

147
00:15:33,347 --> 00:15:33,777
Yeah

148
00:15:39,698 --> 00:15:41,659
This is definitely human blood

149
00:15:42,582 --> 00:15:44,613
The dead person went to heaven alone

150
00:15:44,683 --> 00:15:46,207
Hey,Don't joke

151
00:15:47,355 --> 00:15:49,613
This is the first time

152
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,346
Someone killed and carried out the corpse

153
00:15:52,253 --> 00:15:53,261
It ’s a person who does troublesome things.

154
00:15:53,424 --> 00:15:54,518
It ’s easier to kill elsewhere from the beginning

155
00:15:55,269 --> 00:15:56,081
Where is this person's belongings?

156
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:58,151
Well..there

157
00:16:04,573 --> 00:16:05,448
Hey

158
00:16:06,542 --> 00:16:08,246
Your turn is later

159
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:11,699
This is a police job

160
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,691
I will work first

161
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:13,292
Hmm?

162
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:15,277
I was asked to defend by Fumie Tono

163
00:16:15,394 --> 00:16:16,949
Dead people don't pay defense fees

164
00:16:17,128 --> 00:16:18,949
We just give you an incense

165
00:16:19,472 --> 00:16:23,480
You take pride in your work, so you do this meaningless work.

166
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:26,925
Fumie who died was here with a man last night

167
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,035
That Fumie killed a man and ran away

168
00:16:30,027 --> 00:16:32,628
She jumped from here and committed suicide and dented the car

169
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:35,769
Do you really think so?

170
00:16:36,191 --> 00:16:36,816
What do you mean?

171
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:37,925
Do not pretend you don't know

172
00:16:38,417 --> 00:16:40,175
If you're telling the truth, the man's body should be here.

173
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:41,925
Another person was here

174
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:44,457
But no one from the hotel witnessed it.

175
00:16:45,847 --> 00:16:49,894
But who would bother to call me if She was going to commit suicide?

176
00:16:50,621 --> 00:16:52,582
I see..hmmm...

177
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:55,863
So What are you going to do?

178
00:16:56,738 --> 00:16:57,683
That's not fair

179
00:16:57,816 --> 00:16:58,175
What?

180
00:16:58,355 --> 00:17:00,160
You pretend that you don't know.
You are trying to get a clue

181
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,659
I don't want to get in the way of your work. See you

182
00:17:42,596 --> 00:17:44,830
Call room service if you need

183
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,369
Thanks

184
00:17:47,612 --> 00:17:48,096
Excuse me

185
00:17:48,557 --> 00:17:48,799
What?

186
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:49,440
Wait wait

187
00:17:55,369 --> 00:17:57,916
Your eyes are beautiful.
You are my taste

188
00:17:58,979 --> 00:17:59,455
Here it is

189
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:00,416
Never mind

190
00:18:00,441 --> 00:18:01,526
Just take this

191
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:02,487
Thank you

192
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:05,744
By the way,What does this invitation mean?

193
00:18:06,955 --> 00:18:07,955
You know,right?

194
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,627
You can ask other person

195
00:18:09,652 --> 00:18:11,073
I want to ask you

196
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,260
I only talk to beautiful women

197
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:16,846
You are good at kidding.
Did you come here for the first time?

198
00:18:16,871 --> 00:18:17,393
Yes

199
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:20,830
This invitation says that you must bring your companion

200
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:23,596
You? Can you come with me?

201
00:18:23,729 --> 00:18:26,752
No way, I can't

202
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,565
It is a rule for women to bring men

203
00:18:31,854 --> 00:18:34,041
I see.
I think I know how it works.

204
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,604
That's not good for me...

205
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:54,907
Madam

206
00:18:55,462 --> 00:18:56,306
Madam

207
00:18:56,704 --> 00:18:58,235
Oh it's you

208
00:18:59,039 --> 00:18:59,727
Oh

209
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,563
I met you in a rare place

210
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,900
I was also surprised

211
00:19:04,282 --> 00:19:05,056
Did you do it alone?

212
00:19:05,384 --> 00:19:06,400
I'm sorry not

213
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:07,727
You?

214
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,814
I'm alone

215
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,954
He suddenly became appendicitis

216
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,853
That's too bad

217
00:19:13,134 --> 00:19:14,165
You are lonely alone

218
00:19:14,439 --> 00:19:16,243
But I found a good man instead

219
00:19:17,314 --> 00:19:19,470
There's an interesting party.

220
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:20,978
Can you come with me?

221
00:19:21,165 --> 00:19:22,017
There's an interesting party?

222
00:19:22,493 --> 00:19:24,079
It ’s called the Gozenjin meeting.

223
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:28,275
Actually I am also invited to the party

224
00:19:28,993 --> 00:19:29,798
Really?

225
00:19:30,556 --> 00:19:31,946
Don't be surprised

226
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:33,806
I'm surprised

227
00:19:33,831 --> 00:19:37,165
If you were interested in that party, I would have invited you.

228
00:19:37,946 --> 00:19:40,314
I didn't know that

229
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:43,540
To be honest

230
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:45,790
I don't have good taste

231
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,329
Who invited you?

232
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:48,657
Never mind

233
00:19:48,978 --> 00:19:50,525
She has a boyfriend

234
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:52,939
You don't have to worry about me

235
00:19:54,704 --> 00:19:56,267
I'm curious about that woman.

236
00:19:57,611 --> 00:19:59,579
It's a warm pool but it's getting a little cold

237
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,595
Shall we have a coup of tea?

238
00:20:01,931 --> 00:20:02,407
Um

239
00:20:14,824 --> 00:20:16,761
Hey, who is the woman?

240
00:20:17,191 --> 00:20:18,175
A woman I know?

241
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:19,269
Are you jealous?

242
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:20,058
Who?

243
00:20:20,503 --> 00:20:22,941
Actually I'm really jealous

244
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:24,183
Thanks

245
00:20:24,464 --> 00:20:26,073
So I will tell you

246
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:26,574
Who?

247
00:20:27,886 --> 00:20:28,675
Fumie Tono

248
00:20:29,136 --> 00:20:29,746
Fumie -san

249
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:32,425
I see I see

250
00:20:33,793 --> 00:20:35,558
You should be careful

251
00:20:35,785 --> 00:20:37,535
She is a little dangerous

252
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:38,457
Are you jealous again?

253
00:20:38,543 --> 00:20:39,660
Really

254
00:20:39,949 --> 00:20:41,386
I know her lover

255
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:42,136
Who?

256
00:20:42,339 --> 00:20:44,316
Oh,Are you jealous ?

257
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:45,996
I'm sorry it's wrong

258
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:50,238
I'm just boring man.
I just felt sorry for her

259
00:20:50,464 --> 00:20:54,214
Really?
I've heard he have a promising future as a government official.

260
00:20:54,675 --> 00:20:56,191
A government official? What is his name?

261
00:20:56,472 --> 00:20:58,769
It can't be helped to look up her lover

262
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,144
You don't need to worry

263
00:21:01,277 --> 00:21:03,394
I want to be with you

264
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:05,707
Why are you grinning?

265
00:21:05,933 --> 00:21:06,832
Well...

266
00:21:07,605 --> 00:21:13,535
I think the party where you and Fumie Tono are invited is interesting

267
00:21:13,714 --> 00:21:14,769
Yes it must be interesting

268
00:21:15,121 --> 00:21:18,191
How does the party work?

269
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,168
What?

270
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:23,613
I can't tell you here

271
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:25,863
Is it a serious secret?

272
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,612
I will tell you when we are two

273
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:28,519
Excuse me

274
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:47,644
Hey you

275
00:21:50,566 --> 00:21:52,308
I want 2-6 for 10 and 3-5 for 10

276
00:21:52,683 --> 00:21:53,800
Can you buy a betting ticket without looking at the horse

277
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,339
Your age and my age

278
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:56,191
Can you pay for us?

279
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,316
How much?

280
00:21:57,418 --> 00:21:58,168
200,000yen

281
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:00,253
That's too expensive!

282
00:22:00,511 --> 00:22:01,543
How much have you got?

283
00:22:01,964 --> 00:22:02,940
1/4

284
00:22:03,128 --> 00:22:04,160
Ok I can pay for it

285
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,714
I'll replace the money.

286
00:22:12,605 --> 00:22:13,668
It seems interesting

287
00:22:14,636 --> 00:22:17,668
The only guys here are suspicious people

288
00:22:17,746 --> 00:22:20,855
Yes true, because A lot of money moves here overnight

289
00:22:21,746 --> 00:22:23,355
That ’s why there are many rich people.

290
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:27,535
By the way, there is also fumie's lover in this, right?

291
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,261
Who?

292
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:31,378
We don't care about other people's lovers.

293
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,488
Stop talking about it

294
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,410
Look! A man is there

295
00:22:35,582 --> 00:22:37,464
He is an executive of a trading company

296
00:22:37,699 --> 00:22:38,691
He often comes here

297
00:22:40,175 --> 00:22:41,628
The person who passed in front of us now

298
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:43,339
He is a major shareholder in Kansai

299
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:44,535
I see

300
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:46,691
There are many other officials

301
00:22:47,722 --> 00:22:48,394
I see

302
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:56,925
Everyone, the racehorses of the first race will enter the gate

303
00:23:15,871 --> 00:23:16,918
What is that horse's food?

304
00:23:17,589 --> 00:23:18,699
It ’s not a carrot, right?

305
00:23:19,105 --> 00:23:19,621
It's a Pay

306
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:20,543
Pay?

307
00:23:20,957 --> 00:23:23,269
Horses and jockeys want it, so they run hard

308
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:24,261
Ready

309
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,214
Go for it

310
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:42,324
Fast!

311
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:42,957
Fast!

312
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:45,778
2-6, run fast!

313
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:48,638
Run fast!

314
00:23:49,474 --> 00:23:50,685
Faster! Faster!

315
00:23:56,021 --> 00:23:56,684
Go for it!

316
00:24:03,677 --> 00:24:04,989
What a shame

317
00:24:05,739 --> 00:24:07,450
Embarrassing play between men and women

318
00:24:09,349 --> 00:24:10,060
Some drug patients

319
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,903
This weird play is not the only purpose

320
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:14,950
There is some secret

321
00:24:16,927 --> 00:24:19,232
I have to find out more

322
00:24:21,872 --> 00:24:23,146
Hello, Mr.

323
00:24:23,724 --> 00:24:25,216
Can I have the fire, please?

324
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:31,864
She is nice

325
00:24:32,677 --> 00:24:33,669
She must be elite

326
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:36,646
I wonder who is she

327
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:38,583
She knows me

328
00:24:44,271 --> 00:24:47,232
I didn't know you are here

329
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,778
I didn't know you have this hobby

330
00:24:50,185 --> 00:24:51,638
I don't know your name

331
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:54,208
You also have a good hobby

332
00:24:54,896 --> 00:24:56,318
Who invited you?

333
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:57,732
Wouldn't it be better if I wasn't here?

334
00:24:58,138 --> 00:24:59,818
Not at all,I'm happy to meet you

335
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:02,872
I'll invite you to an even better party next time.

336
00:25:02,997 --> 00:25:03,505
Thanks

337
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,786
Looking at your way of speaking, the organizer of tonight's party must be you

338
00:25:13,364 --> 00:25:13,966
So...

339
00:25:14,114 --> 00:25:17,607
Oh you are here, looks this, I got win!

340
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:21,255
Shall we go back room?
I will lose if I play any more

341
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,481
I will go there soon, wait for me

342
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:23,810
OK I will, give me the key

343
00:25:23,927 --> 00:25:24,435
Um

344
00:25:25,989 --> 00:25:26,560
Here it is

345
00:25:26,585 --> 00:25:27,372
Come soon

346
00:25:27,397 --> 00:25:27,880
Yes

347
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,919
You want to know the name of Fumie's lover, right?

348
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:32,450
Yes

349
00:25:32,708 --> 00:25:33,708
I will tell you

350
00:25:33,974 --> 00:25:34,560
Thanks

351
00:25:39,474 --> 00:25:42,646
The second race will start soon

352
00:25:42,794 --> 00:25:45,607
Please buy a betting ticket

353
00:25:45,857 --> 00:25:49,302
The second race will start soon

354
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:11,896
Is that Ok?

355
00:26:11,968 --> 00:26:12,419
Yes

356
00:26:13,013 --> 00:26:14,091
Then see you tomorrow

357
00:26:14,153 --> 00:26:14,810
Certainly

358
00:26:27,302 --> 00:26:27,724
Wait

359
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:28,122
What?

360
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,700
Who is the woman who went up the stairs now?

361
00:26:30,068 --> 00:26:30,747
That woman?

362
00:26:30,833 --> 00:26:32,896
Hey you, The manager is calling you

363
00:26:33,044 --> 00:26:33,622
It seems urgent

364
00:26:33,864 --> 00:26:36,700
Hey,When you interrupt, say hello

365
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:38,427
I was sorry

366
00:26:43,927 --> 00:26:44,661
Hello?

367
00:26:44,825 --> 00:26:45,310
Um

368
00:26:45,638 --> 00:26:46,857
Do not turn the light

369
00:27:21,193 --> 00:27:22,443
Front please

370
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:26,193
Please contact the police immediately

371
00:27:26,653 --> 00:27:29,411
Here's the case. And don't let the guests out tonight.

372
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,528
Does it make sense"?

373
00:28:15,171 --> 00:28:17,335
Please don't gawk at the woman.

374
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:18,350
Who is the woman?

375
00:28:18,678 --> 00:28:20,335
She is the female president of Sanurou

376
00:28:22,405 --> 00:28:23,327
I see

377
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:25,194
Please come in

378
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,850
So What is Madame's cause of death?

379
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:30,928
Eh?

380
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:36,600
As a result of dissection, half chocolate came out of her stomach

381
00:28:36,905 --> 00:28:38,171
It contained potassium cyanide.

382
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:38,866
Um

383
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:40,006
Of course it's a murder

384
00:28:40,663 --> 00:28:43,256
She kissed someone

385
00:28:44,217 --> 00:28:45,725
Then he pushed chocolate into her mouth with a kiss

386
00:28:46,233 --> 00:28:47,264
It's a romantic murder

387
00:28:47,421 --> 00:28:49,171
What are you talking about?

388
00:28:49,196 --> 00:28:52,186
If I hadn't come along, you'd be the killer.

389
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:52,960
Thank you for that

390
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:53,655
Thanks

391
00:28:55,569 --> 00:28:56,631
How about the human race?

392
00:28:57,186 --> 00:29:01,444
There is no evidence there

393
00:29:01,921 --> 00:29:03,350
I saw with my eyes

394
00:29:05,389 --> 00:29:11,467
There were a lot of people. There was no way he could have escaped in the half hour I found them.

395
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:13,421
It was happened mid-night

396
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:15,999
In addition, there are cordon lines in the mountains

397
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:20,725
No one has run away .
Everyone is complaining

398
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,866
Isn't anyone talking about that human race?

399
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,913
You are the only one who told me

400
00:29:27,647 --> 00:29:30,780
Ita-cho,Why don't you check out the men and women who were racing that horse?

401
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,194
They are a little suspicious

402
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,037
There is no criminal there

403
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:38,186
If there's a murderer out there,he'd get out of there.

404
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,686
If only you had come back to the room with Madam

405
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:44,975
She didn't have to die

406
00:29:45,288 --> 00:29:47,405
I have a grim reaper

407
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:48,717
But,Ita-cho

408
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,421
I feel sorry for Madam but

409
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:53,030
The problem is the other side

410
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:54,772
Why she was killed

411
00:29:55,155 --> 00:29:56,819
Do you have any idea?

412
00:29:57,092 --> 00:29:57,725
I have

413
00:29:58,788 --> 00:29:59,858
In short

414
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:02,693
She wanted me to tell her the name of Tono fumie's lover.

415
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:04,999
Also, I figured out how the party was set up last night.

416
00:30:05,194 --> 00:30:05,811
How the party was set up last night?

417
00:30:06,163 --> 00:30:08,249
Yes, That weird party

418
00:30:09,366 --> 00:30:10,647
He doesn't want her to talk about the party

419
00:30:11,335 --> 00:30:13,702
He killed her to keep her quiet about it.

420
00:30:16,405 --> 00:30:17,983
I really doubt it

421
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:22,889
Ita-cho!
Can you check on that boss lady from earlier, please?

422
00:30:23,819 --> 00:30:25,366
Ryuko Hojoji, right?

423
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,280
The target is big

424
00:30:30,881 --> 00:30:34,858
Fumie and Madam are the member of the party at least

425
00:30:36,108 --> 00:30:37,280
Fumie Tono...

426
00:31:08,712 --> 00:31:11,399
Thank you for taking care of my daughter

427
00:31:11,876 --> 00:31:12,915
Thank you very much

428
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:14,056
Thank you very much

429
00:31:14,081 --> 00:31:15,578
Please make yourself at home

430
00:31:15,603 --> 00:31:16,196
Thank you

431
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:20,306
I wasn't expecting this.

432
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:26,485
She told me in her letter that she was studying a foreign language because of the Olympics this year.

433
00:31:27,884 --> 00:31:32,657
I'm sorry to ask this but do you know her lover?

434
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,290
I heard he is an official

435
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:38,735
Nango-san,Didn't my daughter die of illness?

436
00:31:39,181 --> 00:31:41,024
The police told us so

437
00:31:41,306 --> 00:31:44,462
It doesn't mean that, but I would like to hear about it because of my work.

438
00:31:45,688 --> 00:31:50,063
I was there when she died, and I'd like to hear about it.

439
00:31:51,727 --> 00:31:54,907
Do you know the official's man

440
00:31:56,446 --> 00:31:58,727
I would appreciate it if you could tell me

441
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:00,149
You...

442
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:08,563
I didn't tell anyone because I didn't want my daughter to get in trouble.

443
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:12,493
Actually she was planning to marry a man named Ihoriya

444
00:32:12,518 --> 00:32:13,157
Ihoriya?

445
00:32:13,985 --> 00:32:14,797
Do you write it as Ihori no Tani?

446
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:15,485
Yes

447
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:16,563
His first name is?

448
00:32:16,657 --> 00:32:20,251
My daughter taught only the surname in a letter

449
00:32:20,415 --> 00:32:21,806
She said she would talk about the details after meeting

450
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:22,954
I see

451
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:26,688
I don't know if that person is that official

452
00:32:35,423 --> 00:32:38,462
Can you show me her letter and diary?

453
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:40,829
I don't think there was such a thing

454
00:32:40,931 --> 00:32:42,399
Do you have her notebook or photo album?

455
00:32:42,914 --> 00:32:43,641
There is no,right

456
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,110
No

457
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:45,907
I don't know what happened but

458
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:51,399
The night she died, her room was a huge mess.

459
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,376
I see

460
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,493
Please

461
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:03,548
Can I see the match?

462
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:07,579
Club 3B

463
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,056
Is this hers?

464
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:12,579
Yes,I think it's her part-time job

465
00:33:33,524 --> 00:33:34,290
Never mind

466
00:33:35,266 --> 00:33:38,954
I believe she works here, but do you know her?

467
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,321
This person does not work in here

468
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,602
Is she a regular customer?

469
00:33:47,352 --> 00:33:50,595
It's difficult to remember the customer's face

470
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:05,610
Do you know this person?

471
00:34:06,298 --> 00:34:07,884
She's the one from the other night, the couple.

472
00:34:08,984 --> 00:34:09,586
What do you think?

473
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:11,415
Yes

474
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,329
Yes She was

475
00:34:13,368 --> 00:34:14,149
You sure?

476
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:14,970
Yes

477
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:17,727
Hi

478
00:34:28,993 --> 00:34:29,813
What's wrong?

479
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:31,860
This is a souvenir I bought in Hakone

480
00:34:31,962 --> 00:34:33,688
You're giving it to the wrong person.

481
00:34:34,102 --> 00:34:35,157
Are you jealous?

482
00:34:35,571 --> 00:34:38,196
You are playing with a strange woman

483
00:34:38,306 --> 00:34:40,516
She wants to play with me

484
00:34:41,493 --> 00:34:44,399
Please quarrel after I left

485
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:46,891
She is strong

486
00:34:48,931 --> 00:34:49,806
How about the Hakone's case?

487
00:34:52,235 --> 00:34:53,938
The possibility of drugs is low

488
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:58,141
I searched a lot, but I couldn't find anything.

489
00:34:58,509 --> 00:35:01,938
Really? Certainly drugs were used for human horse racing

490
00:35:02,251 --> 00:35:06,548
If you have a new intuition, the organization is very big

491
00:35:07,266 --> 00:35:09,352
How about the Ryuko Hojoji?

492
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,306
She is a businesswoman

493
00:35:11,641 --> 00:35:14,907
She is nice and trusted by banks

494
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,431
But...

495
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:19,352
She offered a hotel for a weird party

496
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,712
And Madam was killed there

497
00:35:23,063 --> 00:35:24,337
With that Ryuko Hojoji...

498
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,172
Welcome

499
00:35:26,438 --> 00:35:28,259
Thank you for the other day

500
00:35:28,391 --> 00:35:28,743
Hi

501
00:35:29,165 --> 00:35:30,212
What Can I do for you?

502
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:32,016
I just happened to be in the neighborhood, so I stopped by.

503
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:32,618
I see

504
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:33,665
Hey

505
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,485
Ita-cho is here too

506
00:35:36,626 --> 00:35:38,157
I just could relax.

507
00:35:39,313 --> 00:35:40,298
You are a comfortable person

508
00:35:41,352 --> 00:35:43,899
By the way, you met a strange incident in Hakone.

509
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,735
Yes

510
00:35:44,931 --> 00:35:46,368
Please don't make a big deal out of it.

511
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:48,438
You say that like it's someone else's problem.

512
00:35:48,727 --> 00:35:51,657
You had something to do with the dead Madam, right?

513
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,727
That's true, but I'm busy

514
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:56,477
I can't handle this work

515
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:05,711
It is true that Fumie was killed as a result

516
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:07,329
That's a problem

517
00:36:07,368 --> 00:36:10,063
It's going to be hard to get involved with that woman

518
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:11,118
In my opinion...

519
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:12,055
That is the point

520
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:16,227
That's why lawyers like the police and Nango are investigating.

521
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,696
It's not just your problem

522
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:22,938
What if they find out us?

523
00:36:23,399 --> 00:36:24,586
Our boss will get angry too

524
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:29,063
What do you do about Hakone?
Nango got a clue

525
00:36:29,774 --> 00:36:30,586
It's not my fault

526
00:36:30,633 --> 00:36:31,961
Don't worry about that

527
00:36:33,282 --> 00:36:36,321
Boss and we have an idea

528
00:36:38,727 --> 00:36:41,954
I don't know his fast name but his surname is not common, so easy to find

529
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,422
He is an official, Please check immediately

530
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:44,891
Yes

531
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:45,422
Leave it to you

532
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:20,125
A woman

533
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:21,602
Gambling

534
00:37:22,524 --> 00:37:23,227
Drug

535
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:25,719
There must be something

536
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:27,641
What's behind?

537
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:42,625
Hojoji Ryuko...She is suspicious

538
00:37:49,594 --> 00:37:50,375
This is Nango speaking

539
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:54,196
Well...I don't know

540
00:37:56,047 --> 00:37:58,782
Oh..that's you! How are you?

541
00:37:59,641 --> 00:38:01,297
I'd appreciate you called me

542
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:04,383
3B? I know it very much

543
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,329
Certainly, I will visit you for sure

544
00:38:09,141 --> 00:38:10,102
1 am tonight

545
00:38:10,985 --> 00:38:11,368
Then

546
00:38:13,657 --> 00:38:14,610
3B...

547
00:38:16,055 --> 00:38:17,524
Finally you will appear

548
00:39:16,298 --> 00:39:18,571
Thank you for waiting

549
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,251
It is time to have a party

550
00:39:22,228 --> 00:39:25,665
Today's party is called Wall Invitation

551
00:39:26,306 --> 00:39:30,525
What kind of wall to invite men to

552
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,423
First of all, please draw a lottery to decide the order

553
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:38,103
Please

554
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:39,634
Please

555
00:39:41,321 --> 00:39:42,173
Your turn

556
00:39:42,728 --> 00:39:46,853
Please draw lots one by one

557
00:39:47,407 --> 00:39:50,720
Did you draw lots?

558
00:39:53,314 --> 00:39:53,861
Please

559
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:56,525
This is last one

560
00:39:58,673 --> 00:39:59,743
No.1 Please

561
00:40:00,337 --> 00:40:02,212
Who is the no.1?

562
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:03,673
It's me

563
00:40:04,243 --> 00:40:04,876
Oh!

564
00:40:11,548 --> 00:40:15,314
We will invite you to the wall in numerical order

565
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:17,517
No.1 Please

566
00:40:23,665 --> 00:40:24,329
Please

567
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,513
No.1 Please

568
00:40:43,247 --> 00:40:46,146
Take off your favorite high heels

569
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:51,099
Take your time and Choose high heels

570
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:37,620
Then No.2 please

571
00:41:45,597 --> 00:41:46,808
Take your time

572
00:42:19,988 --> 00:42:23,300
I see.
Tonight's party is the best

573
00:42:23,644 --> 00:42:24,808
We have a connection, don't we?

574
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:26,660
Maybe it's bad connection.

575
00:42:45,394 --> 00:42:46,206
Oh wait

576
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,097
I'm sorry for the women if I die in the middle of a kiss

577
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:51,933
What do you mean?

578
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:55,675
Push chocolate with potassium cyanide into the other person's mouth during a kiss

579
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,355
I have read it in a detective novel

580
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:00,581
A woman I know was killed by that

581
00:43:03,988 --> 00:43:04,988
I'm relieved.

582
00:43:05,472 --> 00:43:06,152
You are rude

583
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:08,988
Do not pretend you don't know

584
00:43:14,417 --> 00:43:17,253
We are alone.
 Why don't you take off your mask

585
00:43:29,636 --> 00:43:30,699
What's wrong?

586
00:43:31,949 --> 00:43:34,261
I was thinking about this wonderful night

587
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,191
What kind?

588
00:43:35,917 --> 00:43:36,941
It ’s a story of a murderer.

589
00:43:37,167 --> 00:43:38,175
It ’s a story of a murderer?

590
00:43:39,347 --> 00:43:39,800
You

591
00:43:41,401 --> 00:43:42,948
You know Fumie Tono,right?

592
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:46,941
She died strangely

593
00:43:47,206 --> 00:43:48,839
Did she eat the chocolate?

594
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:49,745
Do not pretend you don't know

595
00:43:50,604 --> 00:43:52,987
It was Madame Hatsuko of Bar Grandprix who was killed

596
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:56,409
The place was a hotel in Hakone that you run

597
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:59,863
Yes, But we are in trouble

598
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:02,183
It will affect our business.

599
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:05,417
I met the deaths of these two women twice

600
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:10,105
The deaths of these two have something to do with each other

601
00:44:10,644 --> 00:44:12,941
It's becoming more like a detective novel

602
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:14,581
I'm sure you know

603
00:44:14,863 --> 00:44:15,394
What?

604
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,058
Why they were killed

605
00:44:17,292 --> 00:44:18,870
That's the job of the police

606
00:44:19,597 --> 00:44:22,277
I hear you are a good lawyer

607
00:44:22,302 --> 00:44:23,503
They were your member,right?

608
00:44:23,785 --> 00:44:24,386
member?

609
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:25,097
Yes

610
00:44:26,785 --> 00:44:28,363
I am also the member

611
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:33,370
I invited you because I thought you were a good partner

612
00:44:34,027 --> 00:44:38,807
But all the women who have something to do with me have been killed

613
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:40,956
Next is my turn?

614
00:44:41,074 --> 00:44:42,839
Or my turn, maybe

615
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,120
If I die, I won't be able to play this kind of fun

616
00:44:46,808 --> 00:44:47,941
I feel same

617
00:44:56,886 --> 00:45:00,074
I wonder where that murderer is.

618
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:08,386
You doubt me after all

619
00:45:09,252 --> 00:45:10,877
Doubt me as a woman

620
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:14,425
No no.. You are best as woman

621
00:45:15,675 --> 00:45:18,300
I'm glad you named me a partner

622
00:45:19,816 --> 00:45:21,941
Your name,Ryuko Hojoji is unusual

623
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:24,199
Were you a noble in the old days?

624
00:45:27,402 --> 00:45:30,433
I was dumped in front of a temple called Hojoji.

625
00:45:31,808 --> 00:45:34,636
It was the year of the dragon at that time, so the name is Ryuko.

626
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:37,371
Mr. Osho gave me the name

627
00:45:39,465 --> 00:45:40,496
And

628
00:45:41,574 --> 00:45:42,769
When I was 16 years old

629
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:46,058
He fucked me

630
00:45:47,886 --> 00:45:49,840
I have many experience

631
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:52,504
But I have never loved

632
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,511
All men are enemies to me

633
00:46:08,582 --> 00:46:10,746
When I first met you

634
00:46:11,996 --> 00:46:13,050
What's wrong?

635
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,433
I'm leaving now

636
00:46:15,957 --> 00:46:17,871
I'm a coward

637
00:46:18,793 --> 00:46:19,621
Then see you

638
00:46:20,894 --> 00:46:21,543
Wait!

639
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,566
Oh..You finally revealed your true identity

640
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:39,074
You become more and more suspicious

641
00:46:39,605 --> 00:46:42,605
I can't die yet. For two friends

642
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:44,238
Don't get me wrong

643
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:47,629
You have not slept with me yet

644
00:46:47,949 --> 00:46:51,340
I want to sleep with you but you have pistol

645
00:46:52,675 --> 00:46:54,043
See you next chance

646
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:47,965
Hey, Ita-cho

647
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:50,394
Were you sleeping?

648
00:47:50,699 --> 00:47:52,269
You said what?

649
00:47:53,371 --> 00:47:54,558
I am not like you

650
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,207
By the way

651
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:58,894
Investigate a club called 3 B in Roppongi

652
00:47:59,160 --> 00:47:59,894
Yes

653
00:48:00,449 --> 00:48:03,168
There may be some clues

654
00:48:04,121 --> 00:48:04,582
Then

655
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:32,347
Hello?

656
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,871
Oh you

657
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:36,558
Good morning

658
00:48:36,754 --> 00:48:38,316
Were you safe last night?

659
00:48:38,816 --> 00:48:39,629
Yes

660
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:41,011
You have a strange voice

661
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,785
I'm just hungry

662
00:48:43,144 --> 00:48:44,441
I don't care about it

663
00:48:44,636 --> 00:48:47,566
I want to eat rice balls

664
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:48,918
You can ask someone to cook it

665
00:49:08,316 --> 00:49:09,980
Wow! that is wonderful!

666
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:15,558
Delicious!

667
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:18,777
You can be nice wife

668
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:19,855
I don't want to hear flattery

669
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,824
I hate people who cheat.

670
00:49:22,050 --> 00:49:23,582
Oh you think too much

671
00:49:24,386 --> 00:49:26,425
I was just about to be killed

672
00:49:34,011 --> 00:49:34,582
You

673
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:35,746
What?

674
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:39,550
You are a lawyer not a detective

675
00:49:41,058 --> 00:49:42,972
I shouldn't have told you about the case

676
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,754
I can imagine it without asking you

677
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:47,629
If so, please understand my feeling

678
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:50,097
It ’s difficult to change my personality from now on

679
00:49:50,324 --> 00:49:51,965
If so,let me help you

680
00:49:52,394 --> 00:49:53,293
You're slowing me down.

681
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,269
I want to help you

682
00:49:56,268 --> 00:49:58,245
I will try not to meet women.

683
00:49:58,418 --> 00:49:59,340
What the fuck

684
00:49:59,675 --> 00:50:00,761
I will leave this office

685
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:04,113
Wait,I will go out of business if you quit

686
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,441
So let me help you

687
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:09,519
You

688
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:14,660
I got the name and office of a person named Ioriya

689
00:50:15,308 --> 00:50:17,254
You did good job!
You are my good assistant

690
00:50:17,402 --> 00:50:18,535
I don't want to hear flattery

691
00:50:18,894 --> 00:50:21,925
I wanted to let you know right away but you weren't there

692
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:22,941
I'm sorry for that

693
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:24,340
So

694
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:28,199

699
00:50:45,504 --> 00:50:49,809

700
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:53,730
I want to meet you and talk to you, Do you have time?

701
00:50:54,410 --> 00:50:54,934

702
00:50:55,816 --> 00:50:59,332

703
00:51:00,019 --> 00:51:01,848

00:51:08,512 --> 00:51:09,871
Fumie's high school is in Yamanashi

708
00:51:10,644 --> 00:51:13,269

719
00:52:01,387 --> 00:52:03,730
You called wrong number, we are not beauty salon

720
00:52:03,832 --> 00:52:06,066
But you are 281-2123,right?

721
00:52:06,684 --> 00:52:09,848
The number is correct but we are small restaurant in Kyobashi

722
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,184
I'm sorry

00:52:15,027 --> 00:52:17,066
OK I see

725
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:19,191
Who is the manager here?

726
00:52:19,394 --> 00:52:20,832
Are you police?

727
00:52:21,059 --> 00:52:22,066
Or Are you a detective?

728
00:52:22,091 --> 00:52:23,082
I am an insurance business

729
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:23,793
You are insurance sells man

730
00:52:23,879 --> 00:52:24,762

00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:27,793
So I'm in trouble if many people die

732
00:52:29,269 --> 00:52:30,855

733
00:52:31,184 --> 00:52:32,863
Ok, can you check please

734
00:52:40,785 --> 00:52:43,105
I called you just before too

735
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,027
Did you call me?

736
00:52:44,052 --> 00:52:44,574
Yes

737
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:49,160
Could you do me a favor?
Can you tell him to withdraw from this case?

738
00:52:49,582 --> 00:52:51,926
Oh do you worry him?

739
00:52:53,918 --> 00:52:55,332
He is lucky man

740
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:56,855
But I can't

741
00:52:57,168 --> 00:52:57,785
Why?

742
00:52:57,810 --> 00:53:00,309
Because he's so stubborn

743
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:01,988
Where is he?

744
00:53:07,902 --> 00:53:09,980
Please bring sake and food to the 3rd table

745
00:53:10,348 --> 00:53:11,730
Thank you very much

746
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:25,488
Welcome

747
00:53:25,746 --> 00:53:26,418
Welcome

748
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,191
Thank you every time

749
00:53:36,543 --> 00:53:37,777
Oh you are here

750
00:53:37,802 --> 00:53:40,074
Mr. Endo, it's rare to meet here

751
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:42,363
This is a nice place

752
00:53:42,816 --> 00:53:45,012
I will tell you the truth

753
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,848
Here is my restaurant

754
00:53:46,873 --> 00:53:48,559
I didn't know that

755
00:53:48,715 --> 00:53:51,332
Tell your lawyer everything

756
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:53,800
Anyway I'm glad to see you

757
00:53:54,191 --> 00:53:55,871
You are playing a lot, right?

758
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:57,160
I look forward to working with you

759
00:53:57,293 --> 00:53:57,973
I know

760
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,168
Then take your time

761
00:53:59,238 --> 00:53:59,762
Thanks

762
00:54:03,012 --> 00:54:03,973
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting

763
00:54:05,777 --> 00:54:08,957
Hey boss,Will tomorrow's deal be on schedule?

764
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:12,465
Why? We can't change our schedule

765
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:17,746
How much does the police know since the Hakone incident?

766
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:20,449
And The Nango...

767
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:24,199
Hey, Nango is here as we thought

768
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,496
He has an assistant named Kyoko look it up

769
00:54:30,168 --> 00:54:32,160
They'll know who I am.

770
00:54:33,277 --> 00:54:37,441
I think it's good that the Iroriya gave Nango the phone number here.

771
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:39,090
I mean

772
00:54:39,988 --> 00:54:42,129
We understand the movement of Nango

773
00:54:42,316 --> 00:54:44,465
We could bring him here

774
00:54:44,723 --> 00:54:46,309
Do you think so?

775
00:54:47,262 --> 00:54:49,324
That's a naive thing to think.

776
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:52,262
He is a tough person

777
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:54,098
I know him very much

778
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:56,902
He is stubborn

779
00:54:59,113 --> 00:55:01,996
We have to decide what our endgame is.

780
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,637
Kazu..OK?

781
00:55:08,785 --> 00:55:10,684
It's time, I'm counting on you

782
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:11,012
OK

783
00:55:50,824 --> 00:55:51,309
Hello?

784
00:56:04,684 --> 00:56:05,980
Thank you very much

785
00:56:12,668 --> 00:56:13,434
Check please

786
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:31,090
Oh you

787
00:56:31,246 --> 00:56:32,801
You're going to Isogaya tomorrow

788
00:56:33,137 --> 00:56:33,582
What?

789
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,004
What did you say?

790
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:37,559
You haven't heard anything?

791
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:42,668
Ioriya told me to buy a ticket for Isogaya at Ueno station tomorrow at 1:00 pm

792
00:56:43,121 --> 00:56:45,301
I get it. Leave it to me after that

793
00:56:45,326 --> 00:56:47,207
He told me that

794
00:56:47,394 --> 00:56:50,144
Don't worry, That's enough for you

795
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:54,402
I also want to take a relaxing bath in the hot springs once in a while

796
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,769
Thank you for your hard work, please wait at the office

797
00:57:08,293 --> 00:57:09,160
Who are you?

798
00:57:09,254 --> 00:57:11,051
We don't want you to investigate

799
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:12,473
I see, I get it

800
00:57:12,776 --> 00:57:13,987
I need to go

801
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:15,418
Wait!

802
00:57:15,684 --> 00:57:17,215
We will beat you!

803
00:57:21,684 --> 00:57:23,301
Oh You learned karate

804
00:57:23,676 --> 00:57:24,496
That's interesting

805
00:57:28,098 --> 00:57:28,902
Damn it!

806
00:57:39,676 --> 00:57:41,254
Hey! Stop it!

807
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:55,215
Hey you

808
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:55,816
Oh

809
00:57:55,965 --> 00:57:57,832
I worried about you

810
00:57:58,262 --> 00:58:00,371
They were going to kill you

811
00:58:00,675 --> 00:58:02,332
Please leave the rest to the police

812
00:58:02,357 --> 00:58:04,426
You know my personality

813
00:58:05,176 --> 00:58:06,715
By the way, I have a request

814
00:58:07,098 --> 00:58:08,730
what is it?

815
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,441
Get a mug shot of Ioriya, Trade Division 4, MITI.

816
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:13,480
Um

817
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:18,293
I looked up him and he's an ordinary official

818
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:21,152
You knew him, didn't you? I was wasting my time.

819
00:58:21,824 --> 00:58:22,582
But

820
00:58:23,512 --> 00:58:26,410
But why he is a member of that party

821
00:58:27,527 --> 00:58:28,637
It's a problem

822
00:58:30,941 --> 00:58:31,949
How about him?

823
00:58:36,793 --> 00:58:38,199
This was the man?

824
00:58:42,285 --> 00:58:43,098
I think so

825
00:58:43,371 --> 00:58:44,184
He was

826
00:58:44,209 --> 00:58:45,262
You sure?

827
00:58:45,287 --> 00:58:45,723
Yes

828
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:47,637
I guided him, so I remember well

829
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,059
OK thank you

830
00:58:49,441 --> 00:58:50,598
Thank you for your good work

831
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:54,355
He is Ioriya for sure

832
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:55,965
I'm convinced by this

833
00:58:57,098 --> 00:59:00,215
But Fumie's partner was killed here

834
00:59:00,512 --> 00:59:02,332
There was no corpse of him

835
00:59:02,863 --> 00:59:03,980
I have an idea

836
00:59:04,973 --> 00:59:07,621
He got blood from some hospital

837
00:59:08,402 --> 00:59:09,824
He pretend to be killed

838
00:59:10,816 --> 00:59:12,910
Then Fumie was surprised, and ran away

839
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:19,340
There was a car down there

840
00:59:19,887 --> 00:59:22,176
She tried to fall down from the balcony

841
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,973
And the Ioriya appeared and pushed her down

842
00:59:26,512 --> 00:59:27,496
I doubt it

843
00:59:27,816 --> 00:59:29,051
There was no reason he killed her

844
00:59:29,410 --> 00:59:30,863
She was 5 months pregnant

845
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,949
Get in the way of his career

846
00:59:33,816 --> 00:59:35,980
Does he murder for that reason?

847
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,309
If he is found, he will be arrested

848
00:59:38,871 --> 00:59:39,582
I see

849
00:59:40,215 --> 00:59:42,559
He was going to kill the child on her stomach

850
00:59:43,285 --> 00:59:45,082
Anyway it was murder

851
00:59:45,504 --> 00:59:46,519
I get it

852
00:59:47,324 --> 00:59:49,894
I understand your reasoning

853
00:59:51,113 --> 00:59:54,371
As I told you last night,Please withdraw from this case

854
00:59:54,918 --> 00:59:55,277
Ita-cho

855
00:59:55,371 --> 00:59:56,761
You're a lawyer. I'm a cop.

856
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,620
Each has a position

857
00:59:58,645 --> 00:59:59,793
It is too late to say it

858
00:59:59,818 --> 01:00:01,043
You understand it,right?

859
01:00:02,488 --> 01:00:03,152
But, Ita-cho

860
01:00:04,472 --> 01:00:06,261
I saw at a hotel in Hakone

861
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,926
They were using drugs and women

862
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,082
I saw their badness

863
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:15,660
I can't forgive them as humans

864
01:00:16,269 --> 01:00:17,840
So it's a police job

865
01:00:19,176 --> 01:00:20,652
And you're in mortal danger.

866
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:22,715
You may be killed

867
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,262
So I'm motivated

868
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:26,277
Criminal investigation is not play

869
01:00:29,699 --> 01:00:30,730
I understand

870
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,590
It's time to go

871
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,387
Where are you doing?

872
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:35,965
It ’s my personal thing.

873
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:37,426
See you then

874
01:00:38,832 --> 01:00:39,973
Your car is ready

875
01:00:40,199 --> 01:00:41,371
It's time to go

876
01:00:41,559 --> 01:00:41,941
I understand

877
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,535
As I said earlier...

878
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,613
About Ioriya?

879
01:00:48,074 --> 01:00:50,598
He is no longer useful

880
01:00:51,613 --> 01:00:54,480
There is already a substitute for him

881
01:00:54,965 --> 01:00:56,637
So do you want to kill him?

882
01:00:57,379 --> 01:00:58,324
You're not thinking clearly.

883
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,941
Why didn't you kill Nango at that time

884
01:01:04,176 --> 01:01:06,957
Do you fall in love with him?

885
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:12,066
You know I'm a woman who doesn't do that

886
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:14,316
Let's go, it's time

887
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:19,567
He's going to isogaya. We have to be careful.

888
01:01:20,872 --> 01:01:21,934
I know that

889
01:01:29,129 --> 01:01:30,856
Oh, Are you Kyoko Kanamaru?

890
01:01:30,973 --> 01:01:31,691
Yes I am

891
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:32,997
Please come early

892
01:01:33,247 --> 01:01:34,418
Nango's in trouble.

893
01:01:34,551 --> 01:01:35,332
He's in trouble?

894
01:01:35,778 --> 01:01:37,114
I'm Inoue from the Metropolitan Police Department

895
01:01:37,364 --> 01:01:39,012
I was contacted by the Ueno police station

896
01:01:39,332 --> 01:01:41,911
He was in a car accident

897
01:01:41,936 --> 01:01:42,285
Oh my god

898
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,582
He is at Ueno Hospital Mr. Ita went there too

899
01:01:45,848 --> 01:01:46,536
You should go

900
01:01:46,561 --> 01:01:47,973
I will get ready soon

901
01:01:56,793 --> 01:01:58,122
Ioriya won't come

902
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:02,075
or He must come,
There is only one train left

903
01:02:03,481 --> 01:02:05,043
What happened to him?

904
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:07,840
Or I wonder if there is any trap...

905
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:06,684
Hello? I want to ask you something

906
01:03:06,825 --> 01:03:07,153
What?

907
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,536
Where did you bring the foreigners?

908
01:03:09,848 --> 01:03:10,793
To Ishinochiya

909
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:13,817
Is there something over there? I went back and forth many times today

910
01:03:14,114 --> 01:03:18,372
There is a party there, I have been invited too, Wait a min

911
01:03:18,786 --> 01:03:19,239
Yes

912
01:03:24,622 --> 01:03:26,965
Where were you hiding

913
01:03:27,192 --> 01:03:27,981
Am I hiding?

914
01:03:28,286 --> 01:03:31,317
Well.. Here is good place to relax

915
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,372
By the way, about Ioriya

916
01:03:33,497 --> 01:03:35,942
Oh,He went missing

917
01:03:36,309 --> 01:03:38,137
I think you are looking for him

918
01:03:38,434 --> 01:03:41,598
I intended to do that, but I can't find him easily

919
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:45,059
Don't be so carefree. Where are you?

920
01:03:45,801 --> 01:03:46,981
You are with Kyoko, right?

921
01:03:47,059 --> 01:03:48,223
What? With Kyoko?

922
01:03:49,372 --> 01:03:50,551
She is not at office?

923
01:03:50,723 --> 01:03:53,434
I've been calling many times since daytime or She can't answer the phone

924
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:55,387
That's strange

925
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:57,973
So where are you now?

926
01:03:58,262 --> 01:04:00,239
I am at Isogawa Onsen

927
01:04:00,934 --> 01:04:02,637
I'm going to Ishinochiya now

928
01:04:03,059 --> 01:04:03,434
Then

929
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:07,801
Tanabe

930
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:08,129
Yes

931
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:09,356
Call the ISOGAYA police office

932
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:09,614
Yes

933
01:04:09,707 --> 01:04:10,778
And Get the car

934
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:46,459
Are there any Japanese women?

935
01:04:46,576 --> 01:04:49,592
Yes There are many. I will show you now

936
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,349
This work will be discontinued for a while at the direction of the chairman

937
01:04:59,349 --> 01:04:59,865
What's wrong?

938
01:05:03,326 --> 01:05:04,013
What?

939
01:06:45,758 --> 01:06:46,891
Hey, I'm counting on you

940
01:07:21,656 --> 01:07:22,695
Too noisy!

941
01:07:23,125 --> 01:07:24,016
Be quiet!

942
01:07:24,618 --> 01:07:26,149
How old are you?

943
01:07:26,938 --> 01:07:27,750
I'm 20

944
01:07:28,883 --> 01:07:29,657
How about you?

945
01:07:31,743 --> 01:07:32,696
How old are you?

946
01:07:35,055 --> 01:07:36,985
Stop it, calm down

947
01:07:37,172 --> 01:07:37,797
I can't

948
01:07:37,844 --> 01:07:39,203
It's your fault.

949
01:07:39,297 --> 01:07:39,750
What?

950
01:07:39,828 --> 01:07:41,047
It's too late!

951
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:41,946
Stop it!

952
01:07:43,368 --> 01:07:46,258
That lawyer will be here. It's a problem.

953
01:07:47,196 --> 01:07:48,805
We have to think about killing him

954
01:08:03,923 --> 01:08:04,696
Boss

955
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:06,719
What's wrong?

956
01:08:06,923 --> 01:08:08,368
We have caught Nango

957
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,204
Good job

958
01:08:10,282 --> 01:08:12,079
Ok you can kill him

959
01:08:12,251 --> 01:08:12,665
I got it

960
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:13,946
Wait

961
01:08:15,798 --> 01:08:17,602
Bring him to my room

962
01:08:17,852 --> 01:08:18,298
OK

963
01:08:20,704 --> 01:08:22,719
Boss,We'll be fine next time?

964
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:26,985
And, Tendo-san

965
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:30,915
OK?

966
01:08:36,298 --> 01:08:37,555
We can't trust her

967
01:08:37,993 --> 01:08:39,501
I wonder if we will cut off with her

968
01:08:42,376 --> 01:08:43,094
Hey!

969
01:08:44,555 --> 01:08:45,204
Damn it

970
01:09:05,923 --> 01:09:06,641
Oh

971
01:09:07,219 --> 01:09:08,578
We meet in the strangest places, don't we?

972
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:09,438
Don't pretend you don't know

973
01:09:10,173 --> 01:09:11,829
You have planed to meet me

974
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:14,048
I haven't invited you tonight

975
01:09:14,073 --> 01:09:17,751
No way, My Assistant Kyoko has been invited

976
01:09:18,634 --> 01:09:20,188
I came on her behalf

977
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,344
By the way,Show me the continuation of the show

978
01:09:31,805 --> 01:09:32,415
Show?

979
01:09:32,766 --> 01:09:35,079
I was disturbed in the middle of the show

980
01:09:35,384 --> 01:09:37,243
I see, Do you want to see?

981
01:09:37,946 --> 01:09:39,727
But tonight's show is boring

982
01:09:47,501 --> 01:09:48,071
Come in

983
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:51,251
I see, next show is peeping

984
01:09:52,204 --> 01:09:54,188
this is not my taste but no choice

985
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,274
Are you sure?

986
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:03,384
Kyoko!

987
01:10:06,993 --> 01:10:07,571
You!

988
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:13,548
Let's talk calmly

989
01:10:29,540 --> 01:10:31,110
Let's deal now

990
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:32,219
A deal?

991
01:10:33,907 --> 01:10:36,923
Please bring Kyoko and another women here before that

992
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,024
We can deal after that

993
01:10:38,227 --> 01:10:39,290
Don't bullshit

994
01:10:39,743 --> 01:10:40,946
We can deal it later

995
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,001
What the fuck

996
01:10:42,977 --> 01:10:44,360
Drug,smuggling

997
01:10:44,977 --> 01:10:46,891
I know you do illegal business

998
01:10:47,805 --> 01:10:50,626
You are trading those women

999
01:10:51,509 --> 01:10:54,790
I saw it with my eye, and you are the boss

1000
01:10:55,891 --> 01:11:00,798
I hate people who take advantage of the weak.

1001
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,126
You're a lawyer, so you're good at talking

1002
01:11:04,235 --> 01:11:06,305
Thank you for complimenting me but

1003
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,149
What are you going to do?

1004
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:09,813
I want you to give up

1005
01:11:10,110 --> 01:11:10,774
You want me to give up?

1006
01:11:11,063 --> 01:11:11,618
Or

1007
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:12,688
You want me to work with you?

1008
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,079
Don't say bullshit

1009
01:11:14,407 --> 01:11:15,665
You are my enemy

1010
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:17,930
But I need you

1011
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:19,337
What do you mean?

1012
01:11:20,001 --> 01:11:21,610
Please be clear

1013
01:11:24,798 --> 01:11:28,891
We love each other or kill each other

1014
01:11:29,532 --> 01:11:31,134
There is only one way

1015
01:11:31,501 --> 01:11:32,212
What?

1016
01:11:34,321 --> 01:11:36,134
What if I say I love you?

1017
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:39,063
I see...Do you want to play a trick on me?

1018
01:11:40,282 --> 01:11:43,274
I'm serious..trust me

1019
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,102
I'm honored to be liked by bad people

1020
01:11:49,985 --> 01:11:50,485
OK

1021
01:11:51,876 --> 01:11:54,165
then I will kill Kyoko Kanamaru

1022
01:11:55,766 --> 01:11:58,837
I will not make any unprofitable deals.

1023
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:04,539
You are a poor woman.
Do you think you can get real love in a deal?

1024
01:12:13,423 --> 01:12:14,079
Boss!

1025
01:12:43,985 --> 01:12:44,774
Kyoko!

1026
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:02,407
Kiichi Ioriya

1027
01:13:02,813 --> 01:13:05,891
You killed Fumie Tono and Madam

1028
01:13:06,188 --> 01:13:07,798
And you tried to kill me at 3B

1029
01:13:08,266 --> 01:13:08,860
I don't know!

1030
01:13:08,885 --> 01:13:09,493
You don't know?

1031
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,032
Don't pretend you don't know

1032
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:16,212
You know how Fumie Tono felt when she called me on that snowy day?

1033
01:13:16,462 --> 01:13:18,305
I didn't intend to kill her

1034
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:19,774
As a result, it ’s a murder.

1035
01:13:21,274 --> 01:13:23,774
I loved her

1036
01:13:24,298 --> 01:13:25,102
So.. I...

1037
01:13:26,344 --> 01:13:28,430
You wanted money and drugs

1038
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:31,673
She said she would reveal your secret if she couldn't marry you

1039
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:32,798
Then you killed her

1040
01:13:33,626 --> 01:13:34,516
Is that right?

1041
01:13:37,860 --> 01:13:38,828
I am a lawyer

1042
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,446
In some cases you may defend

1043
01:13:42,274 --> 01:13:44,711
But I feel like killing you now

1044
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:46,875
Stay down!

1045
01:13:47,391 --> 01:13:50,774
I'm revealing your secret!

1046
01:15:16,164 --> 01:15:16,860
Listen to me!

1047
01:15:17,727 --> 01:15:18,976
Article 36 of the Penal Code

1048
01:15:19,524 --> 01:15:22,985
Attacking others for self-defense is not a punishment

1049
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:28,641
In short, If I kill you, there is no punishment

1050
01:15:37,188 --> 01:15:37,641
Shit!

1051
01:16:07,961 --> 01:16:08,446
Hey you

1052
01:16:10,594 --> 01:16:11,141
Tendo

1053
01:16:14,391 --> 01:16:15,657
You are bad lawyer

1054
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:19,414
You disturb me without my defense

1055
01:16:20,516 --> 01:16:23,305
Your father was better

1056
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:26,891
His son is in trouble with a strange sense of justice

1057
01:16:28,328 --> 01:16:29,758
I will beat you

1058
01:17:26,235 --> 01:17:27,063
Awww!

1059
01:17:35,664 --> 01:17:36,555
Wait!

1060
01:17:43,321 --> 01:17:44,063
Awww!

1061
01:17:48,117 --> 01:17:49,133
Tendo!

1062
01:18:03,438 --> 01:18:04,641
Where is Kyoko and others?

1063
01:18:04,797 --> 01:18:05,890
I don't know

1064
01:18:06,578 --> 01:18:07,219
Tendo!

1065
01:18:07,804 --> 01:18:10,797
You profited from drugs and sold a woman

1066
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:12,750
And you hosted a secret party

1067
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:13,938
Tendo!

1068
01:18:14,766 --> 01:18:16,547
I'm sorry I was your lawyer

1069
01:18:16,813 --> 01:18:17,344
You!

1070
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:18,664
I can't breath!

1071
01:18:19,758 --> 01:18:20,774
I'm not bad

1072
01:18:21,164 --> 01:18:21,711
Nango-kun

1073
01:18:22,711 --> 01:18:23,446
I'm sorry

1074
01:18:23,821 --> 01:18:25,547
It's too late!
You are bad!

1075
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,227
Nango-kun!

1076
01:18:29,937 --> 01:18:30,844
Hello?

1077
01:18:31,649 --> 01:18:33,977
Where is Kyoko?

1078
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:35,430
I can't breath!

1079
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:36,860
Where is she now?

1080
01:18:37,391 --> 01:18:39,750
She is with Ryuko...

1081
01:18:40,375 --> 01:18:41,157
You sure?

1082
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:43,125
Hi

1083
01:18:43,235 --> 01:18:43,789
Ita-cho!

1084
01:18:43,977 --> 01:18:46,289
I'm in trouble if you strangle the serious suspect

1085
01:18:46,314 --> 01:18:46,946
How are women?

1086
01:18:47,016 --> 01:18:48,110
We rescued them

1087
01:18:48,135 --> 01:18:49,063
Ok I'll leave the rest to you

1088
01:19:06,446 --> 01:19:07,266
Kyoko!

1089
01:19:08,938 --> 01:19:09,469
Kyoko!

1090
01:19:09,735 --> 01:19:10,329
Kyoko!

1091
01:19:10,610 --> 01:19:11,165
Kyoko!

1092
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:12,617
After all you came

1093
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:16,313
Why do you do this?

1094
01:19:16,594 --> 01:19:17,462
Because I hate it

1095
01:19:17,626 --> 01:19:18,204
You hate what?

1096
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:23,868
Don't worry.
She will wake up after an hour

1097
01:19:27,485 --> 01:19:30,336
You are a stubborn woman.
Ichimiya has been arrested

1098
01:19:31,282 --> 01:19:32,102
You should turn yourself in.

1099
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:34,344
Will you defend me?

1100
01:19:35,087 --> 01:19:36,134
Depend on the case

1101
01:19:38,227 --> 01:19:39,813
I don't need to go to the police

1102
01:19:40,165 --> 01:19:42,516
There's a membership list in this room with all the information on the organization.

1103
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:45,149
I'll give it to you as a souvenir.

1104
01:19:45,501 --> 01:19:46,305
Where is it?

1105
01:19:47,126 --> 01:19:49,438
Inside the small door under the French doll

1106
01:19:51,540 --> 01:19:52,469
Hello!

1107
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:54,907
Hello!

1108
01:20:09,368 --> 01:20:10,071
Wait

1109
01:20:13,024 --> 01:20:14,212
I will take it

1110
01:20:22,305 --> 01:20:23,048
Hello!

1111
01:20:23,626 --> 01:20:24,149
Hello!

1112
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:26,649
Check inside the box

1113
01:20:26,891 --> 01:20:28,165
Call an ambulance!

1114
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:28,415
Oh

1115
01:20:29,555 --> 01:20:30,907
There was a pistol on the door

1116
01:20:35,618 --> 01:20:36,923
Hey, Are you OK?

1117
01:20:37,579 --> 01:20:38,344
Wake up!

1118
01:20:39,937 --> 01:20:40,555
Hey!

1119
01:20:40,923 --> 01:20:41,454
I...

1120
01:20:43,032 --> 01:20:43,438
I...

1121
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:44,344
What?

1122
01:20:45,813 --> 01:20:46,954
I loved you

1123
01:20:50,704 --> 01:20:51,649
The only one

1124
01:20:53,118 --> 01:20:53,899
Come on!

1125
01:20:54,173 --> 01:20:54,829
Nango-san...

1126
01:20:55,157 --> 01:20:55,790
Where are you?

1127
01:20:56,790 --> 01:20:58,376
Where are you?

1128
01:21:01,993 --> 01:21:02,587
Come on!

1129
01:21:03,337 --> 01:21:04,048
Come on!

1130
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:06,844
Hey!

1131
01:21:14,368 --> 01:21:17,548
Great information is written here

1132
01:21:18,141 --> 01:21:20,110
The business relationship is also written in detail

1133
01:21:20,423 --> 01:21:21,587
This is so great

1134
01:21:22,532 --> 01:21:24,634
It would be a big fuss if we announced this

1135
01:21:27,368 --> 01:21:29,368
It looks like her last work

1136
01:21:30,462 --> 01:21:31,446
I feel sorry for her

1137
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,259
That's too bad

1138
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:39,923
It's not like you to sympathize with the bad woman

1139
01:21:40,009 --> 01:21:42,719
Well...There are many types of villains

1140
01:21:44,251 --> 01:21:45,735
She was born unhappy

1141
01:21:47,118 --> 01:21:50,993
I think if she was born happily, she was a good wife

1142
01:22:13,263 --> 01:22:16,380
I don't want you to be deeply involved in my work

1143
01:22:20,052 --> 01:22:21,724
You are good at making rice balls

1144
01:22:22,857 --> 01:22:24,325
You should find a marriage partner

1145
01:22:24,747 --> 01:22:25,489
You mean

1146
01:22:26,060 --> 01:22:27,302
I don't like you

1147
01:22:33,224 --> 01:22:36,552
I will be careful about women from now

1148
01:22:39,057 --> 01:22:44,986
I'd like to be on your short list of potential marriage partners.

1149
01:22:46,908 --> 01:22:47,705
You!

1150
01:22:51,072 --> 01:22:51,752
Kyoko

1151
01:22:53,307 --> 01:22:55,666
There's something going on every day under this sky.

1152
01:22:57,393 --> 01:22:59,870
I'm always needed

1153
01:23:01,627 --> 01:23:04,791
If I wish so, Do you laugh at me?

1154
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:06,385
I don't

1155
01:23:19,049 --> 01:23:25,330
Finish

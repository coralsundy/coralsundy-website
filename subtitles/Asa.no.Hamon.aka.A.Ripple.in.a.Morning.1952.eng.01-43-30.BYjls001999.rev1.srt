<i>Asa no Hamon / A Ripple in a Morning (1952)</i>

3
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:50,975
Bank of America, N.T. & S.A. , Tokyo, Japan

4
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,201
Yes, the letter of credit
distinctly mentions porcelain dinner sets.

5
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,269
Even so, porcelain dinner sets could be toys.

6
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:08,042
If it had been specified as general merchandise
there would have been no difficulty.

7
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:12,332
That's where I want you to give
the meaning leeway in the interpretation.

8
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,277
If the bank accepts the meaning, it can be done.

9
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:21,905
As far as the merchandise is concerned,
we have every confidence 
that we can do much better than any other firm.

10
00:02:27,823 --> 00:02:29,503
Sanko Trading Co.,LTD

11
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,007
I'm back.

12
00:02:31,032 --> 00:02:31,789
Welcome back.

13
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,709
Was it really no good?

14
00:02:33,734 --> 00:02:35,578
He said ok

15
00:02:35,873 --> 00:02:37,179
Oh, thank you for your hard work.

16
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,914
It took a while for him to approve it

17
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,055
But I made it

18
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,531
Finally, it's a great success!

19
00:02:45,641 --> 00:02:47,875
It's great to have this deal

20
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:49,500
Satomi?

21
00:02:49,822 --> 00:02:52,031
In the end, it's all about the trust in the reference books

22
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,780
Wow, it's all about Tokimoto-kun's skills

23
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,986
No matter how many times I went,

24
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,265
He didn't approve.

25
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:03,586
There

26
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,640
Well then, preparations this.

27
00:03:07,876 --> 00:03:09,046
I'm going to Towa Bank

28
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:12,211
Car.

29
00:03:12,408 --> 00:03:13,750
The car is parked.

30
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:15,140
Kitatomi

31
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:18,497
I need to get the trade bill discounted

32
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:20,727
You'll be in New York next week.

33
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:25,210
so please take care of things while I'm away

34
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:30,171
Is Takimoto-kun going too? To America?

35
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,078
No way.

36
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:39,125
Kimura-kun, can you take care of this sample?

37
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:39,820
Yes.

38
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:47,816
Are you going home already?

39
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,916
I wish I could be let go during the day sometimes,

40
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:51,654
I'd like you to send a telegram.

41
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,546
To the Jefferson Company in San Francisco

42
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:55,734
OK

43
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,410
Do you think Kaji can make a deal with?

44
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,336
Of course,

45
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:12,726
I'd like to get it done before breakfast

46
00:04:13,664 --> 00:04:15,023
Kaji works hard?

47
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,878
Ako-chan,you are better than him

48
00:04:20,906 --> 00:04:21,625
Oh....

49
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm a ghost!

50
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,679
Whoa, whoa! W-Whoa! Whoa!

51
00:05:09,695 --> 00:05:11,656
Hey, say something.

52
00:05:12,016 --> 00:05:13,938
It's very rude to say nothing.

53
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,898
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

54
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,117
What's the hell?

55
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,492
What do you mean?

56
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:23,382
Ah! This is strange!

57
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:37,638
Kenji! Come out!

58
00:05:38,148 --> 00:05:38,820
Is it okay now?

59
00:05:40,085 --> 00:05:40,966
Kenji!

60
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,398
Yes!

61
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:44,578
Oh, big sister,

62
00:05:44,603 --> 00:05:45,281
Welcome back.

63
00:05:46,494 --> 00:05:47,609
As expected, you didn't bark

64
00:05:47,789 --> 00:05:48,757
What prank?

65
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:50,125
It's not a prank

66
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:51,976
We're serious, you know

67
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,093
See, Peke hasn't been barking at all

68
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:55,908
So we are having Ino-san scare

69
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:56,648
huh, Ino?

70
00:05:56,996 --> 00:05:57,515
Ino?

71
00:05:57,859 --> 00:05:59,867
My best friend, Ino

72
00:06:01,548 --> 00:06:03,640
I was also playing a part for Peke,

73
00:06:04,885 --> 00:06:05,761
you know, Peke

74
00:06:10,843 --> 00:06:12,171
I apologize for the inconvenience

75
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,406
Well then, I'm heading home, Ken-chan

76
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,646
Oh, that's mine, just leave it as is

77
00:06:15,693 --> 00:06:17,289
Oh, right. I'll go get my stuff

78
00:06:17,314 --> 00:06:18,507
I'll take it.

79
00:06:22,258 --> 00:06:23,047
Peke.

80
00:06:24,662 --> 00:06:26,820
Don't get angry

81
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:29,225
Wang!

82
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:33,288
That's not good

83
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:34,929
Come on.

84
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:36,100
oh mom

85
00:06:36,976 --> 00:06:39,345
Welcome back

86
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,046
Welcome back, Aunt

87
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,898
Oh, what a nice dog!

88
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:47,219
What's its name?

89
00:06:47,552 --> 00:06:48,234
Nana-chan

90
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,102
Nana-chan?

91
00:06:52,763 --> 00:06:53,679
 Both of them are yours?

92
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,437
Yeah,

93
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,859
Peke is my dog

94
00:06:57,258 --> 00:06:57,742
Right?

95
00:06:58,448 --> 00:06:59,265
Yours?

96
00:07:02,295 --> 00:07:03,437
Let's take a walk

97
00:07:09,727 --> 00:07:10,508
Who's he?

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,388
He's Ken-chan's best friend

99
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,959
Well, it seems like he really loves children.

100
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,426
Hey, Ken-chan?

101
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,398
What?

102
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:30,984
Is that person your sister?

103
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:32,382
No, she's not.
She is my relative.

104
00:07:33,296 --> 00:07:33,945
What about your dad?

105
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,176
He died in battle

106
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:35,977
In the Philippines

107
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:39,953
Where is your mom

108
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,307
She's in Hakone

109
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,296
She's working as an office clerk at a hotel

110
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,945
Office clerk?

111
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,765
That's why I'm living as a freeloader

112
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:48,813
You know, Peke?

113
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,265
Peke!

114
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,359
Peke

115
00:07:58,633 --> 00:07:59,188
Peke

116
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:06,679
Hey, catch the ball!

117
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,953
Once again

118
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,306
Just now, Shiro-san stopped by

119
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:18,895
Wow, that's unusual. What's wrong?

120
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,585
It's about your marriage proposal,

121
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:25,615
but no, I'm not thinking about marriage at all

122
00:08:26,023 --> 00:08:27,539
It sounds like a nice offer,

123
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:29,937
so maybe you should meet him

124
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:37,117
But I'm sorry, I don't want to compromise my life by
getting married just because of an arranged marriage

125
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:38,984
I have to decline.

126
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:43,835
You still can't forget about Fujiwara-san,
who has disappeared, right?

127
00:08:45,109 --> 00:08:45,938
No, that's not it

128
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,937
Sure, at first I might have tried to forget by immersing myself in work,

129
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,718
but now work is my whole life, you know

130
00:08:55,736 --> 00:08:59,242
After all, women should be feminine

131
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,468
I intend to be feminine, you know?

132
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:06,671
Is that so?

133
00:09:08,968 --> 00:09:13,539
I’m really thinking more seriously about my life

134
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,290
Oh? That sounds like something my father back.

135
00:09:19,315 --> 00:09:20,641
Well then, I’ll leave it to you

136
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:25,706
Yes, I stopped by the art club
for the first time in a while

137
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,492
because there was an exhibition by Akae

138
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,632
Well, is that so?

139
00:09:31,527 --> 00:09:35,039
The Iwayama bookstore visited here

140
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:38,492
So, this person

141
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:42,594
He visited about book royalties.

142
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:43,820
I see.

143
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,398
I bought that

144
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,296
What a wonderful flower

145
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,470
Oh? Ken-chan!

146
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,250
Ken-chan!

147
00:10:06,275 --> 00:10:06,945
What happened?

148
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:09,823
Oh, Peke did it again!

149
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:12,421
Ken-chan!

150
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,125
Yes!

151
00:10:15,539 --> 00:10:16,285
What?

152
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,816
You have to keep Peke
on a leash properly!

153
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,804
He is always crying

154
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,876
He makes such a pitiful sound

155
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,445
I really don't want to hear complaints from the neighbors anymore

156
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,484
One dog is enough

157
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:32,890
I don't think we need a stray dog.

158
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:36,910
Ken-chan, come on

159
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,226
Ken-chan?

160
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:41,930
Mom

161
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:45,904
Ken-chan takes care of him well

162
00:10:46,203 --> 00:10:47,141
But...

163
00:10:47,749 --> 00:10:50,749
Well, I'll be asking

164
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:53,320
Ken-chan, shall I go with you?

165
00:10:53,523 --> 00:10:55,000
Have a dinner.

166
00:11:03,977 --> 00:11:05,625
Peke!

167
00:11:07,344 --> 00:11:09,218
Oh, isn't this Ino-san's?

168
00:11:16,898 --> 00:11:18,086
Ako Takimoto

169
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,086
Hello?

170
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,023
I'm sorry for the other day

171
00:11:25,048 --> 00:11:25,828
Not at all.

172
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:27,289
Thank you for returning the book

173
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:28,734
I received the book from Ken-chan

174
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:34,725
Where do you work?

175
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm working at the trading company

176
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:37,676
Trade?

177
00:11:37,824 --> 00:11:40,150
It's Fuji Trading Company

178
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,306
I hear you are Reference Trading Company

179
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:45,885
I hear your English is very good

180
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:48,910
Did Ken-chan say that?

181
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,916
I'm not good at it, you know

182
00:11:50,947 --> 00:11:51,936
I'm really no good

183
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,275
Come on

184
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:55,390
I really don't have that talent

185
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,076
I do read it,

186
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,890
but I can't speak it

187
00:11:59,305 --> 00:12:01,063
I'm not the type of person to work for a trading company.

188
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:13,055
Why is the sky so beautiful?

189
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:17,375
I saw the same sky in Myanmar

190
00:12:17,688 --> 00:12:18,539
In Myanmar?

191
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,489
This design's not so good. Mm-hmm.

192
00:12:27,065 --> 00:12:29,999
This is our best number. How do you like it?

193
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,283
- I think that's just what you wanted?
- Yes

194
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:38,309
But the price is too high.

195
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:41,705
Mr. James, don't forget it's exceptional quality.

196
00:12:47,445 --> 00:12:48,820
You made it

197
00:12:50,498 --> 00:12:53,936
You're very busy while the president is away.

198
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:54,769
Why?

199
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,968
It seems that Satori-san has quite
a bit of resentment towards you

200
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,406
In other words, your skills is too good

201
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,929
He is jealous of you

202
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,650
You're a secretary and you do a great job.

203
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,076
No matter what is said to me,

204
00:13:09,117 --> 00:13:09,969
It's fine

205
00:13:10,349 --> 00:13:13,349
I'm doing for our company.

206
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,255
No, that's not

207
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,316
This is a reference shoji

208
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:28,733
You have a visitor

209
00:13:29,359 --> 00:13:29,813
Who?

210
00:13:30,204 --> 00:13:31,359
Mr.Inoda

211
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:42,080
Oh, were you surprised?

212
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,007
No, not really

213
00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:46,393
but is something the matter?

214
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,328
Well, by chance,I got two tickets for the Menuhin concert

215
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,156
Menuhin concert?

216
00:13:52,181 --> 00:13:53,773
This is the ticket for tonight,

217
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:55,203
but can you make it?

218
00:13:55,228 --> 00:13:56,804
Oh, I'm just a bit busy right now,

219
00:13:57,562 --> 00:14:00,155
but I'll take care of it right away

220
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,726
Well then, I'll be waiting outside

221
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:07,695
So, is your name Ako?

222
00:14:07,821 --> 00:14:10,577
No, it's not Ako, it's Atsuko

223
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:13,750
You are not Ino, but Inoda, aren't you?

224
00:14:23,882 --> 00:14:25,628
Oh, You won't go home?

225
00:14:25,699 --> 00:14:27,995
My buyer and I have an appointment at 6 o'clock.

226
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,546
Mr.Thomas

227
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,086
Oh, then I'll go ahead,

228
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,106
Ako-chan

229
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:34,866
Who is that person?

230
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,906
He's Ken-chan's best friend who is at our place. Goodbye

231
00:14:38,931 --> 00:14:40,101
Goodbye

232
00:14:47,547 --> 00:14:48,805
Thank you for waiting

233
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,386
They say it will start exactly at 6 o'clock,

234
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,867
so let's pick up the car

235
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:55,742
If we hurry and send the food to the community hall...

236
00:14:55,767 --> 00:14:57,414
Takimoto-kun! Phone!

237
00:14:57,609 --> 00:14:58,922
Is it a call? Ohashi?

238
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:01,115
The president is calling you

239
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:01,695
To Hakone

240
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,147
just say I've already returned

241
00:15:04,308 --> 00:15:07,308
I refuse to engage in any business related to play.

242
00:15:08,406 --> 00:15:11,820
I'll just go and decline, sorry Just a moment,

243
00:15:26,388 --> 00:15:29,388
I'll be right there.

244
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,306
all the paperwork

245
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:34,886
related to that document?

246
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,910
yes, I understand

247
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,416
I'm really sorry

248
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,406
I made you waste
a hard-to-get ticket

249
00:15:45,438 --> 00:15:46,184
It's ok

250
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,216
Well,  invites someone else

251
00:15:51,335 --> 00:15:53,239
I'll give you the ticket as a souvenir.

252
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:56,591
I'll take this ticket, thank you

253
00:15:57,670 --> 00:15:59,636
It seems like you enjoy working

254
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:02,660
Yes, I love it, but I'm busy

255
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,066
What about you, Inoda?

256
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,981
Well,I do like working too

257
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,434
But I'm not good at trading.

258
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,116
I want to quit, you know

259
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:13,148
Are you going to quit?

260
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
However, they don't let me quit easily

261
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:22,280
The mountains of Hakone are the pride of the nation

262
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:27,060
I'll stop by Ken-chan's mom's place on the way back

263
00:16:27,943 --> 00:16:28,685
That's good.

264
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,591
Ito-kun

265
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,115
Ito-kun

266
00:17:15,388 --> 00:17:16,935
Inoda-san

267
00:17:17,738 --> 00:17:18,458
Good morning!

268
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:22,224
Are you leaving already?

269
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,750
Actually,I shouldn't go out

270
00:17:27,335 --> 00:17:29,754
The paid holiday period ends today

271
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,934
Oh, that's not good

272
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,169
Take care of your health

273
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,028
Thank you

274
00:17:37,427 --> 00:17:42,240
I'm going to the personnel department.

275
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:56,764
Inoda,You don't need to feel sorry for him

276
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:58,880
Because of his chest illness

277
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:01,905
It's not like serious desire.

278
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,223
What's wrong?

279
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,786
Are you going to let me resign again?

280
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:16,747
Today it's not about me, but about someone else

281
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,840
I can't believe you're taking on even the matter of someone's resignation

282
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,876
You're quite an overbearing man, aren't you?

283
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,317
I don't want people who get sick to quit work.

284
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,136
He goes to work even though he is sick

285
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,160
You should talk to your manager about that,

286
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,294
but I would like to request a special arrangement

287
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,473
Well, speaking of which, I heard you made another mistake.

288
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:50,044
Sigh, I'm really not good at English

289
00:18:52,642 --> 00:18:55,642
Yes, but that is an important job for us as well

290
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Somehow, please wrap up the conversation well.

291
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:06,645
You are called Hanpeta(A man who often makes mistakes), aren't you?

292
00:19:07,872 --> 00:19:09,319
Yes

293
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,959
Oh, I see. However, I don't think so

294
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,981
You are not Hanpeita

295
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,990
Anyway, I can't fire you while you're still a Hanpeita

296
00:19:30,497 --> 00:19:32,239
Haha, I'm happy about our love

297
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,583
No, this is not just your problem

298
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,122
I hope that at least streptomycin becomes
more affordable,

299
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:45,825
Streptomycin...

300
00:20:02,008 --> 00:20:07,532
I never thought I would end up like this when I was in the south

301
00:20:30,267 --> 00:20:33,267
What happened with the work?

302
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:35,635
I don't think there's any prospect

303
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,211
It's a business worth 150 million yen

304
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,063
Japanese traders are losing their motivation, but it's not easy

305
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,633
Thank you very much

306
00:20:49,972 --> 00:20:52,972
Hello, could you please connect me to the pharmaceutical department?

307
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,146
Oh, is this the pharmaceuticals department?

308
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:59,170
What was the name of the company that makes Streptomycin again?

309
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hey? Could you please look up the address for me?

310
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,836
That is Malcolm Company

311
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:08,426
Ah, so it's really Malcolm, huh?

312
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,821
Is something wrong?

313
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,555
Actually,

314
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,580
When I was working at a bath detention center in Burma,

315
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:18,990
there was an American young man named Mal

316
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,336
He was suffering from malaria,

317
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,356
so I secretly gave him quinine

318
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,146
That Mr. Maru is called Henry Malcolm

319
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,688
But isn't it a misunderstanding
about Malcolm?

320
00:21:31,567 --> 00:21:32,348
Well, I guess that's true.

321
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,274
There's a visitor.

322
00:22:03,226 --> 00:22:06,148
I think she'll come soon

323
00:22:11,726 --> 00:22:12,711
Welcome

324
00:22:12,892 --> 00:22:14,274
Aunt.

325
00:22:14,618 --> 00:22:15,798
Welcome.

326
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:17,399
It's been ages.

327
00:22:17,439 --> 00:22:18,946
Thank you for calling me this morning

328
00:22:19,055 --> 00:22:19,466
Not at all.

329
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,846
Are you staying over here?

330
00:22:20,886 --> 00:22:23,886
Yes, Ken-chan is very energetic

331
00:22:23,918 --> 00:22:25,969
I'm sorry for the trouble

332
00:22:28,626 --> 00:22:31,086
Is he studying?

333
00:22:31,636 --> 00:22:34,290
Don't worry,

334
00:22:35,696 --> 00:22:37,228
I'm sorry for the trouble

335
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:44,872
It must be tough for you too, aunt

336
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:47,727
I'm getting used to this job

337
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:51,166
Since last month, I have been in charge of foreign customers.

338
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,656
I hope you'll be with Ken-chan soon

339
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,836
But in Kenji's letter

340
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,396
Apparently he made a friend named Ino

341
00:22:59,382 --> 00:23:01,157
Ino?

342
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,204
Ino really takes good care of Ken-chan

343
00:23:03,493 --> 00:23:04,313
Really?

344
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,816
He's the same age as Kei?

345
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,165
He a real adult

346
00:23:09,579 --> 00:23:10,810
He is a bit of an oddball.

347
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:13,305
Is he hanging out with adults like that?

348
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,243
but Ken-chan has his good points too, you know?

349
00:23:15,313 --> 00:23:18,844
Is he a friend of Atsuko?

350
00:23:19,024 --> 00:23:20,431
He has nothing to do with our house.

351
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:21,743
I see.

352
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:24,939
Atsuko should really consider getting married soon

353
00:23:30,836 --> 00:23:33,836
Oyato is back

354
00:23:33,868 --> 00:23:34,649
I see.

355
00:23:35,477 --> 00:23:36,274
Hold on.

356
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,071
Hi! Isn't that Atsuko-san?

357
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,220
Hello, Mr. Bradford!

358
00:23:53,048 --> 00:23:54,178
Welcome back

359
00:23:54,616 --> 00:23:55,302
Thank you

360
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,017
- How do you do?
- Fine, thank you!

361
00:23:59,842 --> 00:24:01,253
- Have you been playing golf?
- Yes

362
00:24:01,417 --> 00:24:03,217
- How was the game?
- Great!

363
00:24:04,226 --> 00:24:08,347
I'm having a little trouble, Atsuko-san.
It's about business.

364
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:13,141
Doesn't your firm handle toilet articles, Atsuko-san?

365
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,804
No, Mr. Bradford.

366
00:24:17,503 --> 00:24:19,975
It's for an order of about thirty thousand dollars.

367
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:22,642
- Thirty thousand dollars?
- Yes!

368
00:24:23,631 --> 00:24:26,230
And if you care to handle it, I'll give it to you.

369
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:33,651
I went ahead and said okay

370
00:24:35,462 --> 00:24:36,595
That's way too easy.

371
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,090
Those kinds of craftsmen are often from long-established businesses,

372
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,246
and they're truly troublesome

373
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,270
I don't like things that come with so many complaints

374
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,876
Besides, I don't like it when you steal orders;

375
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,900
such despicable acts affect the company's reputation

376
00:24:51,729 --> 00:24:56,282
However, I don't think it's stealing since the other party didn't show up on the contract date

377
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:59,071
Mr.Bradford is having trouble with that

378
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:01,595
Is that not good?

379
00:25:02,069 --> 00:25:03,635
I can't agree with that, you know

380
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,306
Moreover, our president is currently absent....

381
00:25:26,238 --> 00:25:27,136
Takimoto-kun

382
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:29,480
Let's do the job

383
00:25:30,066 --> 00:25:31,816
That job is about 30,000 dollars,
which is roughly 10 million yen

384
00:25:32,103 --> 00:25:36,058
well...It's not about money

385
00:25:36,175 --> 00:25:39,175
It's a business you've taken on without any selfish desires

386
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,574
Kicking that is just harassment towards Ako-chan,

387
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:43,104
That's not acceptable.

388
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:44,589
I did it selfishly

389
00:25:45,035 --> 00:25:45,629
You did it selfishly?

390
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,535
Don't say that

391
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,140
Until now, haven't you been the one bringing in all the work by yourself?

392
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,074
I was also reckless

393
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:57,964
Decorations are difficult, aren't they?

394
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,706
Besides, it's the first time for us,

395
00:26:00,794 --> 00:26:02,590
so isn't it interesting?

396
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:05,942
It's not like our company can't do it

397
00:26:08,910 --> 00:26:09,824
Let's do the job

398
00:26:10,574 --> 00:26:12,074
I don't mind fighting with Hisatori

399
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:34,615
Kaji-san, do I seem cheeky?

400
00:26:35,714 --> 00:26:37,363
Am I an unpleasant woman
from a man's perspective?

401
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,745
What's wrong?

402
00:26:40,341 --> 00:26:42,417
Please tell me honestly

403
00:26:42,757 --> 00:26:44,972
I don't think so, but?

404
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,894
But?

405
00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:51,755
Women who are good at their jobs are more likely to be disliked by men

406
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,511
In the end, It's just male jealousy.

407
00:26:57,535 --> 00:27:01,660
I don't like being thought of badly by others.

408
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,880
Ako-chan has that kind of side to her as well?

409
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,696
You should be well thought of by everyone

410
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,495
In other words, the woman is being needy

411
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:16,965
Kaji, will you go with me?

412
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:18,691
to Mr.Bradford's office

413
00:27:26,276 --> 00:27:29,276
It's all about business, right?

414
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,066
We'll take care of this job

415
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:43,230
Will you?

416
00:27:44,221 --> 00:27:45,731
I'll say this for the sake of doing it

417
00:27:46,135 --> 00:27:49,339
It's better to keep business and personal feelings separate

418
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:50,878
Personal feelings?

419
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,636
Welcome back.

420
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,542
Are you alone?

421
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:27,035
Thank you very much.

422
00:28:46,886 --> 00:28:48,355
Is something wrong?

423
00:28:52,878 --> 00:28:53,839
Where's Peke?

424
00:28:54,093 --> 00:28:55,539
I keep him at home

425
00:28:55,564 --> 00:28:57,183
because my aunt will get mad.

426
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:13,660
Huh?Peke Peke Peke?

427
00:29:14,651 --> 00:29:15,456
What's wrong?

428
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,441
Oh here

429
00:29:18,295 --> 00:29:19,777
That's not good,

430
00:29:23,371 --> 00:29:24,504
He pissed.

431
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,256
Peke, that's not good

432
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,644
Where did you bring it?

433
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:54,683
Nana?

434
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:55,973
Nana!

435
00:29:56,644 --> 00:29:57,473
Nana!

436
00:29:57,713 --> 00:29:59,988
that not good

437
00:30:40,747 --> 00:30:44,308
Nana? Nana? A ghost?

438
00:30:46,691 --> 00:30:48,512
Oh Ken-chan

439
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:51,129
Peke,that's not good.

440
00:30:53,576 --> 00:30:56,576
The location for our school field trip has been decided.

441
00:30:56,816 --> 00:30:57,418
Where?

442
00:30:57,488 --> 00:30:58,316
Hakone

443
00:30:58,621 --> 00:30:59,199
Hakone?

444
00:30:59,574 --> 00:31:01,683
I hope that but actually Nikko.

445
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:03,340
I see

446
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:06,308
I found Ino's house. It's huge.

447
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,308
I was surprised

448
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:08,160
I see

449
00:31:08,425 --> 00:31:09,269
Nana?

450
00:31:09,848 --> 00:31:10,355
Nana?

451
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:12,785
Don't let him into the house

452
00:31:15,168 --> 00:31:15,941
Nana?

453
00:31:29,714 --> 00:31:32,495
Ken-chan, could you guide me
to Ino's place?

454
00:31:32,855 --> 00:31:33,980
Now?

455
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:35,136
Are we really going?

456
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,839
This is a very big apartment

457
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,714
Inoda Niheita.

458
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:15,808
Sis

459
00:32:25,348 --> 00:32:26,792
Here's like haunted house.

460
00:32:30,512 --> 00:32:31,293
Sis

461
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:39,910
Hit this

462
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:41,660
Sis

463
00:32:47,158 --> 00:32:47,972
I'm going to try hitting this

464
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,605
Welcome.

465
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:19,183
Um, is Mr. Ino.....Inoda there?

466
00:33:19,862 --> 00:33:21,828
Who are you?

467
00:33:22,324 --> 00:33:23,410
We are Takimoto.

468
00:33:24,289 --> 00:33:26,995
Please wait a moment,Sakimoto

469
00:33:27,028 --> 00:33:28,597
Um, this is Takimoto.

470
00:33:30,644 --> 00:33:31,453
Akimoto?

471
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:32,910
Takimoto.

472
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:34,660
If my name is hard to understand,

473
00:33:34,989 --> 00:33:35,777
it's 'Kagawa'

474
00:33:35,925 --> 00:33:36,785
Tagawa?

475
00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:40,894
not 'Ta', but 'Ka', 'Ka'. 'Kagawa'...

476
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:46,331
Ah, there are so many names
that end like that,

477
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,200
and you are here to see Masako?

478
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,339
She went out earlier

479
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:57,324
I'll just take care of this for a moment,

480
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:05,863
Please stop messing around.

481
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:22,800
How about we go check it out?

482
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:24,207
Well...

483
00:34:24,752 --> 00:34:26,495
It would have been nice to bring Peke along

484
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:33,159
Big sister.

485
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,500
Please.

486
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:49,970
Well, it's the first time such a beautiful young lady has come to see him.

487
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,800
Hello Ino,

488
00:34:56,974 --> 00:34:57,907
Kenichi

489
00:34:58,532 --> 00:35:00,571
Oh, it's you!

490
00:35:03,901 --> 00:35:04,594
Hello?

491
00:35:06,763 --> 00:35:08,099
I apologize for sitting down

492
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,190
It's because my maid said you're friend of Masako

493
00:35:14,228 --> 00:35:16,535
Come in

494
00:35:19,849 --> 00:35:21,813
That old lady is an interesting one,
isn't she?

495
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,720
Yeah, that old woman is here from long time ago

496
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,606
Excuse me.

497
00:35:40,767 --> 00:35:41,874
This is awesome.

498
00:35:44,062 --> 00:35:45,236
but that's quite a dirty teacup, isn't it,

499
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:46,183
Ken-chan?

500
00:35:46,761 --> 00:35:48,155
It's too dirty.

501
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:50,189
It's a nice teacup, you know

502
00:35:50,393 --> 00:35:51,286
Korean pottery,

503
00:35:51,645 --> 00:35:53,833
huh? Really?

504
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,403
Please, come on in

505
00:35:56,963 --> 00:35:58,231
Well then...

506
00:36:02,135 --> 00:36:05,315
actually, Thanks for the ticket for the other day.

507
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:09,515
You are called Niheita?

508
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:14,326
That's right, my late father was 1 heta, and I am 2 heta

509
00:36:16,714 --> 00:36:18,747
In my company, they call me half heita.

510
00:36:20,384 --> 00:36:21,277
It's called Hanpeita

511
00:36:22,564 --> 00:36:23,470
Hanpeita?

512
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:28,122
It's meaning half a portion

513
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,536
Mr. Inoda specializes in economics, right? Yes,

514
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,323
I'm studying Keynes

515
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:52,266
I want to quit
trading and study more,

516
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,896
but I just can't seem to stop

517
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,880
Why is that?

518
00:36:56,652 --> 00:36:59,335
I made a terrible mistake

519
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,378
Did you completely outsmart me?

520
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,628
Me?

521
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:09,349
I messed up our appointment at 10
o'clock on Tuesday

522
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,739
It must have been 10 o'clock on Thursday

523
00:37:14,985 --> 00:37:18,027
I'm terrible at the phone call in English

524
00:37:19,842 --> 00:37:21,042
About Mr.Bradford?

525
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:23,255
Ino?

526
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:28,020
What's wrong?

527
00:37:29,783 --> 00:37:30,590
What's wrong?

528
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:32,629
Peke took one of this.

529
00:37:32,837 --> 00:37:33,530
That's not good

530
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:34,833
Is the culprit you, Peke?

531
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,955
I'm sorry.

532
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,139
Peke-kun is really lonely too, you know

533
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,227
Kenji,right?

534
00:37:48,634 --> 00:37:49,847
I left something.

535
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,132
This is my younger sister, Masako

536
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:02,275
She's attending art school

537
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,116
Her part-time job is as a sign painter in Asakusa,

538
00:38:04,141 --> 00:38:05,145
You're annoying

539
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:10,301
This is the talented company president's secretary, Ako Takimoto

540
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,276
Calling me talented is a bit of an exaggeration

541
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,182
I'm taking my shoes.

542
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,927
Excuse me as well

543
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:20,186
Excuse me

544
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:40,647
Brother

545
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:45,028
Isn't it wonderful?

546
00:38:46,497 --> 00:38:48,229
For Hanpeita,
this is quite an achievement

547
00:38:50,476 --> 00:38:53,722
You were planning to go to the concert with her.

548
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,186
She came today to thank you for that

549
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,986
Hmm, there's a relation

550
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,926
She was just coming to say thanks

551
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,387
Then I guess that's how it is

552
00:39:03,585 --> 00:39:05,278
I think so.

553
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:09,487
Spring has come for Hanpeita-san

554
00:39:16,778 --> 00:39:17,452
Senior

555
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,348
Hello

556
00:39:22,033 --> 00:39:23,362
welcome, Numazawa

557
00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:26,285
I came to contact you from the rowing club

558
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,611
Please, anything but donations.

559
00:39:28,838 --> 00:39:29,611
It's not a donation.

560
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,846
Dr. Uehara from Hokkaido is coming to Tokyo for the first time in a while,

561
00:39:33,876 --> 00:39:35,516
so the doctor is coming

562
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:40,204
So, Mr. Hayakawa is really enthusiastic about
the welcome race, or rather, the welcome event,

563
00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:46,000
where we have a competition between alumni and
students, and then we can drink and eat afterwards

564
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,116
This is good idea, isn't it?

565
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,326
It's been decided for this Sunday at 3 o'clock

566
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:53,058
Alright.

567
00:39:54,556 --> 00:39:56,495
I'm fed up with the company

568
00:40:00,354 --> 00:40:01,984
Alright, it's been a while,

569
00:40:02,009 --> 00:40:02,977
let's give it a shot

570
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,906
However, please don't complain about the difficult situation

571
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:11,257
Don't be silly, will I really lose?

572
00:40:14,598 --> 00:40:16,345
I wonder if you are okay?

573
00:40:34,679 --> 00:40:35,708
Inoda-san

574
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:37,546
About the Bradford case, right?

575
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,876
I found out that the order was placed with Nankai Trading in Kobe

576
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:40,930
I see.

577
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:44,339
It seems that a person called Kaji is in charge of it

578
00:40:45,575 --> 00:40:46,508
Kaji?

579
00:40:47,303 --> 00:40:49,996
That Kaji and Takimoto is getting marriage

580
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,360
Getting marriage ?

581
00:40:52,064 --> 00:40:52,891
It's about the time

582
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,578
In other words,it's soon

583
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:58,265
Oh I see

584
00:40:59,003 --> 00:41:01,508
Well, Inoda-san, leave it to me

585
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,522
But you see, that's completely my responsibility,

586
00:41:05,547 --> 00:41:06,466
so just watch and see

587
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:12,030
Getting marriage ?

588
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:24,731
Kon Kon chi ki

589
00:41:28,123 --> 00:41:28,736
Ako

590
00:41:29,023 --> 00:41:29,523
What?

591
00:41:30,006 --> 00:41:33,113
I just got call from Nankai trading company, but It seemed something was wrong.

592
00:41:34,181 --> 00:41:34,801
What do you mean?

593
00:41:35,139 --> 00:41:40,076
Right now, they're hesitating about whether it's too late to catch up

594
00:41:40,603 --> 00:41:41,939
What's the reason?

595
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,610
They say that productivity isn't improvingdue to management legends,

596
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,403
That's strange.

597
00:41:48,663 --> 00:41:49,830
They're making excuses.

598
00:41:50,415 --> 00:41:51,822


599
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:54,943
I asked them to follow through. I forced them to sign the contract.

600
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,024
I wonder Fuji company has something with it

601
00:41:58,258 --> 00:41:59,518
Fuji company obstacle us

602
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:00,826
I can only think of it that way

603
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,966
Who on earth is the one who messed up that order?

604
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:07,990
I also found out about that by chance 2,3 days ago

605
00:42:08,015 --> 00:42:10,841
It's a person named Ino-san or Inoda-san

606
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,258
Ah, that guy

607
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,295
Someday, she came here

608
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:17,036
Yeah, He's suspected

609
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,956
It's strange that He's getting closer to Ako

610
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,016
To the person who took his job

611
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,040
But I don't think Inoda-san is that kind of person

612
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,757
Are you close to him?

613
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:35,598
I'm not

614
00:42:36,378 --> 00:42:37,531
It's not like that

615
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:40,152
He's not like that person.

616
00:42:41,995 --> 00:42:44,576
so I understand that he takes care of Kenchan well.

617
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:26,502
Hello

618
00:43:27,527 --> 00:43:28,405
This is Kagawa.

619
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:29,531
Isn't my mother here?

620
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:30,835
Is she a customer?

621
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,685
She's the office staff here

622
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:32,946
The office staff here?

623
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:34,186
She's Kagawa Kayo

624
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,936
I'm Kagawa Kenichi

625
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:39,305
Mom! Mom!

626
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:53,681
Hello

627
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,108
Kenichi

628
00:43:55,508 --> 00:43:57,528
You should have called me if you'd come

629
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,726
Wasn't it a school trip to Nikkō?

630
00:44:01,372 --> 00:44:03,487
I wanted to surprise Mom too,

631
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:04,241
Kayo.

632
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:06,117
A person is waiting for something

633
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,540
Please wait a moment

634
00:44:36,815 --> 00:44:38,735
Oh Mr. Kimura?

635
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:42,506
because he wanted to stay with his mother

636
00:44:42,531 --> 00:44:43,614
I brought him here

637
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,333
I appreciate your help

638
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:49,726
Ken-chan

639
00:44:51,458 --> 00:44:53,275
You are not a clerk, huh?

640
00:44:55,290 --> 00:44:55,886
Even my sis says

641
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,985
you are a clerk,

642
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,610
so I'm sorry for lying

643
00:45:14,570 --> 00:45:15,701
I won't stay

644
00:45:22,866 --> 00:45:26,065
It's ok if you stay here

645
00:45:29,615 --> 00:45:30,402
Ken.

646
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,410
I'm going

647
00:45:36,083 --> 00:45:38,300
Mom, mom

648
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:29,540
Ino-san didn't know at all,

649
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:31,111
Ino didn't lie to Ken-chan,

650
00:46:32,439 --> 00:46:37,052
Ako sis seemed like a liar, but she thinks about Ken-chan Since she lied,

651
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:38,920
Get it?

652
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:39,807
Ken.

653
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:41,591
Stay strong

654
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:45,967
I wonder why my dad died

655
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:48,973
Ino-san went to war but came back

656
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,517
Forget about it

657
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,056
Ken-chan? Should I take you to the boat races?

658
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:17,262
Ah, that sounds good

659
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,916
Are you going to do it, Ino-san?

660
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:19,558
Yeah,

661
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:21,634
I'm excited.

662
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:24,186
Ah, will you really take me to Asakusa?

663
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:25,306
That's nice.

664
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:27,116
Are you really going to take me?

665
00:47:27,141 --> 00:47:27,780
Alright,

666
00:47:29,234 --> 00:47:30,395
I'll go later

667
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,206
I came to see your losing

668
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:33,731
I won't lose that easily

669
00:47:34,066 --> 00:47:34,973
See what happens.

670
00:47:35,017 --> 00:47:36,020
Well, I am off then

671
00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:38,805
Hey Ken-chan, huh?

672
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:43,586
Oh, is big sister at home?

673
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:44,055
Yeah,

674
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,552
I heard she's really busy

675
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:50,420
Hey, it's cold there, so make sure to get some exercise

676
00:47:58,187 --> 00:47:58,770
Hey, where are you going?

677
00:47:59,486 --> 00:48:00,316
To the company

678
00:48:00,607 --> 00:48:01,348
I'm busy.

679
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:02,789
Ken-chan

680
00:48:06,526 --> 00:48:07,099
Ken-chan

681
00:48:08,034 --> 00:48:09,045
Let's hurry and go.

682
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,880
I'm off

683
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,406
Hey, are you still not ready?

684
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:19,515
I'll be borrowing Ken-chan for the whole day today

685
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:21,570
Thank you for always taking care of Atsuko

686
00:48:21,947 --> 00:48:22,643
Not at all.

687
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:26,708
Well, there's a boat race at Sumida river
from 3 o'clock today

688
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:28,534
I'm going to take
Ken-chan along to the boat race

689
00:48:29,252 --> 00:48:30,152
Boat race?

690
00:48:31,898 --> 00:48:32,892
Are you going out?

691
00:48:35,869 --> 00:48:39,759
Ah, in a poor company
like ours, we can't even take Sundays off

692
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,698
I'll be heading out now

693
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:51,926
Thank you for waiting, I can't find my hat.

694
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:52,696
Is this ok?

695
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:55,069
let's go

696
00:48:55,236 --> 00:48:55,629
I'm off

697
00:48:56,009 --> 00:48:56,889
Please

698
00:49:00,923 --> 00:49:01,397
Peke

699
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:02,543
I'm going

700
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,026
Shall we go see the movie in Asakusa?

701
00:49:09,349 --> 00:49:10,346
I want to eat a katsudon

702
00:49:10,433 --> 00:49:11,366
Katsudon, huh?

703
00:49:13,071 --> 00:49:13,598
I'm off.

704
00:49:21,841 --> 00:49:22,479
What's wrong?

705
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,406
I forgot something!

706
00:49:26,084 --> 00:49:29,028
He really seem like a nice person

707
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:30,666
Is that so?

708
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:13,064
Hi

709
00:50:13,551 --> 00:50:14,391
Oh Furuta

710
00:50:14,782 --> 00:50:16,199
You are really late.

711
00:50:17,185 --> 00:50:18,172
My bad.

712
00:50:18,569 --> 00:50:20,122
It's been a while

713
00:50:21,293 --> 00:50:22,499
Hey, Furuta, you're a strange guy

714
00:50:22,557 --> 00:50:24,836
Is he your friend?

715
00:50:24,976 --> 00:50:26,152
that's right

716
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:28,354
We saw movie in Asakusa and had katsudon

717
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,666
So I'm late

718
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,606
Well then, I'll show our race to him

719
00:50:31,630 --> 00:50:32,876
Hey I'm not kid

720
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,446
Alright, alright,You are great

721
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:36,306
hey, Furuta

722
00:50:36,330 --> 00:50:38,846
As a punishment for being late, I'll take you without a warm-up

723
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:39,478
OK

724
00:50:39,955 --> 00:50:42,100
Big brother,good luck

725
00:50:44,267 --> 00:50:45,333
Hurry up.

726
00:50:47,076 --> 00:50:50,564
We'll have race now

727
00:51:14,368 --> 00:51:15,408
Oh Atsuko sis

728
00:51:25,049 --> 00:51:27,020
People from big companies are quite something, aren't they?

729
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,386
I envy you for being able to play on your days off

730
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,164
Kaji

731
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:31,176
I understand

732
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,686
Inoda, let's compete fairly in the marketplace

733
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,739
I want you to stop the malicious interference

734
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,404
Even without that, we are already at a disadvantage

735
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:46,983
I can't stand dirty dealings

736
00:51:47,241 --> 00:51:47,841
Dirty?

737
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:53,101
A big company like yours shouldn't have to worry about such a small deal.

738
00:51:54,529 --> 00:51:55,676
Inoda-san, listen

739
00:51:56,493 --> 00:52:00,612
You have unfairly taken away the contract that we obtained fairly.

740
00:52:01,083 --> 00:52:02,143
That's not fair.

741
00:52:04,971 --> 00:52:05,584
Kaji

742
00:52:06,186 --> 00:52:08,121
Why don't you calm down and talk?

743
00:52:08,468 --> 00:52:10,468
Business should be about fair play

744
00:52:14,872 --> 00:52:18,655
Inoda, Nankai Shoten has finally given us their last warning today

745
00:52:19,150 --> 00:52:20,836
This is clearly said to be a connection to Fuji company

746
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:21,810
Don't you think so?

747
00:52:22,950 --> 00:52:24,146
Mr. Inoda

748
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,000
Say something

749
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:28,128
He can't say anything

750
00:52:29,670 --> 00:52:30,614
But Inoda-kun,

751
00:52:31,094 --> 00:52:32,096
Takimoto-kun, and I are all in this together

752
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:34,482
We're putting our lives on the line for this business

753
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,428
Just remember that well

754
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:43,146
I see.

755
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,159
What a big nonsense, you say?

756
00:52:45,379 --> 00:52:46,326
What do you mean?

757
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,456
It's a big nonsense indeed

758
00:52:48,993 --> 00:52:49,504
You're rude.

759
00:52:49,644 --> 00:52:50,437
What do you mean?

760
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:53,716
It's not a scam

761
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:59,073
You truly are a something like non sense

762
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:03,964
I have no regrets about the past

763
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:07,692
Inoda! Let's go!

764
00:53:15,887 --> 00:53:17,263
He's weird

765
00:53:18,093 --> 00:53:19,579
One day, I'll peel off the mask,

766
00:53:20,106 --> 00:53:22,090
I feel....

767
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:25,470
Let's go home, it's so ridiculous

768
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:32,087
Ready?

769
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:46,237
Come on.

770
00:53:53,225 --> 00:53:54,712
Here we go.

771
00:53:55,991 --> 00:53:57,758
Ready?

772
00:53:59,104 --> 00:54:00,164
Keep it up

773
00:54:46,765 --> 00:54:47,306
Let's have a toast

774
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:48,095
Ryo-chan,

775
00:54:48,746 --> 00:54:49,813
Let's have a party

776
00:54:50,519 --> 00:54:52,326
We can do Kinchan here

777
00:54:54,016 --> 00:54:55,254
What's Kinchan?

778
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:58,545
That's Kintaro

779
00:54:59,571 --> 00:55:02,295
That's right.
We can pay by credit here

780
00:55:03,669 --> 00:55:06,382
That's funny to say

781
00:55:08,267 --> 00:55:09,367
Yeah.

782
00:55:13,959 --> 00:55:15,450
Please enjoy as much as you like

783
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:20,371
Madam, you did very well.

784
00:55:21,310 --> 00:55:23,403
Ah, he will be a full serving

785
00:55:23,675 --> 00:55:26,384
I started this business

786
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,633
You guys have to come here

787
00:55:28,793 --> 00:55:29,466
Sure

788
00:55:29,674 --> 00:55:31,661
We will spend money here

789
00:55:31,756 --> 00:55:34,756
Will you take over this business?

790
00:55:39,072 --> 00:55:40,445
Have a seat

791
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,396
I'm here to help you!

792
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:43,268
Konkonchiki

793
00:55:44,233 --> 00:55:45,270
I'll do it,

794
00:55:46,992 --> 00:55:48,978
Is that the Kon kon moon?

795
00:55:51,076 --> 00:55:54,374
However, The boat race was fun

796
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:56,838
From the beginning, It was difficult to judge

797
00:55:57,424 --> 00:55:59,328
I really couldn't bear to watch it

798
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:00,596
In front of that woman,

799
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,751
it's like a real swordsmanship dojo

800
00:56:02,405 --> 00:56:04,605
Definitely like this.

801
00:56:09,681 --> 00:56:11,705
There was a theory that said he became a woman hater

802
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:13,232
It seems that's not the case

803
00:56:13,493 --> 00:56:14,593
It is a good trend, right, Heita?

804
00:56:21,843 --> 00:56:24,558
Inoda-san, everyone
is making fun of you, huh?

805
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,161
Well, it's fine to be Hanpeita.

806
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,154
Let's sing, senpai.

807
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:51,293
Did you tell Nankai Training Company to stop selling their products?

808
00:56:51,687 --> 00:56:53,550
I can't do that with the reference shoji

809
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,480
I knew it. Can I cancel that?

810
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:00,175
It's just adding shame on top of shame

811
00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:03,488
Even if I approve it, Mr. Hata will not approve it.

812
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:06,152
We can't

813
00:57:06,536 --> 00:57:08,441
Please consider us.

814
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:23,196
Is this a reply from Malcolm?

815
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,220
Oh, it was Malcolm Jr.

816
00:57:26,663 --> 00:57:27,847
I heard he returned home safely, wow

817
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,918
As expected, he's the son of Malcolm Pharmaceuticals?

818
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,402
So you asked about the medicine?

819
00:57:35,504 --> 00:57:38,504
They can't be mass-produced in America, after all

820
00:57:39,730 --> 00:57:41,308
There's an allocation, so they can't be free,

821
00:57:41,488 --> 00:57:42,449
That's just how it is.

822
00:57:43,161 --> 00:57:44,097
That's impossible.

823
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:51,543
Inoda-kun

824
00:57:57,597 --> 00:57:58,275
Ah, well, I appreciate your hard work, but

825
00:57:58,300 --> 00:57:59,957
I want you to head to Nagoya today

826
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:01,550
What for?

827
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:04,766
I would like you to make a contract for the
registration for the Williams Town Association

828
00:58:31,449 --> 00:58:32,160
Hi.

829
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:40,418
Are you off to Kobe?

830
00:58:40,696 --> 00:58:42,182
For Nankai company?

831
00:58:44,645 --> 00:58:45,906
Is Kaji-kun not with you?

832
00:58:46,027 --> 00:58:47,456
No, I'm alone

833
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,186
Oh, is Inoue-san also off to Kobe?

834
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,706
that's not right

835
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:52,675
No, I am off to Nagoya.

836
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,918
I'm going to buy ceramics

837
00:58:55,542 --> 00:58:57,207
It's really dangerous,
you know

838
00:58:57,418 --> 00:58:58,457
It's true.

839
00:59:00,536 --> 00:59:02,347
But it's tough, isn't it?

840
00:59:04,067 --> 00:59:05,965
It's my responsibility.

841
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,420
I was the one who brought this story up first

842
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:17,170
If this continues, it will become a breach of contract

843
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,308
Well then,

844
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,310
I'd like to introduce you to the dining car.

845
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:26,046
It is now tea time

846
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,070
Please feel free to make use of it

847
00:59:32,850 --> 00:59:33,875
Excuse me

848
00:59:48,511 --> 00:59:49,785
I apologize

849
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:48,059
May I come in?

850
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:57,490
I'm from reference company.

851
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,816
Is your boss around?

852
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,683
He isn't here.

853
01:01:01,482 --> 01:01:02,543
He is at the factory.

854
01:01:29,488 --> 01:01:30,863
He was here until now,

855
01:01:30,895 --> 01:01:32,152
but he has left

856
01:01:55,168 --> 01:01:56,184
Excuse me

857
01:01:56,387 --> 01:01:57,160
Hi

858
01:01:58,520 --> 01:01:59,324
Oh Matsushima

859
01:02:00,168 --> 01:02:01,738
Welcome.

860
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:04,082
I'm in trouble

861
01:02:04,645 --> 01:02:05,840
I'm here to ask you

862
01:02:06,606 --> 01:02:08,270
We are in trouble too.

863
01:02:09,449 --> 01:02:12,043
Is that a duty to Fuji Company?

864
01:02:12,754 --> 01:02:16,887
And then there's the issue of power saving and blackouts.

865
01:02:18,756 --> 01:02:22,886
Um... with this, it would mean we are in breach of contract with Mr. Bradford

866
01:02:23,420 --> 01:02:29,238
Unlike large companies like Fuji Trading, if we did something like that, our credibility would drop to zero

867
01:02:29,832 --> 01:02:32,118
It might be a fatal blow to the reference company

868
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:33,722
Matsushima-san, um,

869
01:02:34,207 --> 01:02:35,129
I see

870
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:39,379
please ensure stability until that day

871
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:40,756
Thank you in advance

872
01:02:40,780 --> 01:02:41,796
Please

873
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,543
Matsushima-san, please

874
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:46,160
Matsushima-san, please

875
01:02:49,110 --> 01:02:51,527
If it comes to this, I'm going to tell you the truth

876
01:02:52,090 --> 01:02:57,972
I'm being threatened to stop doing business with your company.

877
01:02:59,024 --> 01:03:03,988
We also get some flexibility from the Fuji Trading Group

878
01:03:05,787 --> 01:03:10,082
In this case, it's a matter that concerns international credibility rather than the pride of our companies,

879
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:13,011
so it's troubling to hear that

880
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,121
Forgive me....

881
01:03:15,315 --> 01:03:17,886
Please tell the union leader about it.

882
01:03:17,978 --> 01:03:18,699
But

883
01:03:18,879 --> 01:03:21,184
I am in a bit of a hurry.

884
01:04:10,605 --> 01:04:13,605
Yes, yes,

885
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:15,644
hello, reference shoji?

886
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:17,207
This is Takimoto here.

887
01:04:17,574 --> 01:04:18,465
Is Kaji there?

888
01:04:19,871 --> 01:04:22,589
Do you know when he will be back?

889
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:24,691
please let him know when he returns

890
01:04:24,716 --> 01:04:27,699
Please tell him that it is no longer possible to do business with Nankai Company.

891
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:54,665
Inoda

892
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,769
Phone call from Kobe.

893
01:04:56,363 --> 01:04:56,886
I see.

894
01:05:03,043 --> 01:05:04,871
Ah, hello? Hello?

895
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:06,175
Is this Nankai?

896
01:05:06,882 --> 01:05:08,254
it's Matsushima, isn't it?

897
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,144
This is Inoda from Fuji Trading

898
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,650
Um... about the reference shoji we discussed...

899
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,590
That, um,

900
01:05:34,668 --> 01:05:35,293
Ako?

901
01:05:36,621 --> 01:05:37,363
Oh Kaji

902
01:05:38,830 --> 01:05:40,286
I heard about the phone call yesterday

903
01:05:40,310 --> 01:05:42,097
I flew here by plane

904
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:45,396
I was giving up today, but I'm counting on you, Kaji

905
01:05:45,420 --> 01:05:48,996
I just can't help it, it's definitely about Fuji Trading

906
01:05:49,863 --> 01:05:53,074
Yeah, it's Fuji Trading. Anyway, we sent telegram to Nankai company.

907
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:57,675
Hmm, should we go check it out right away?

908
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:01,802
It's a matter of international deliberation

909
01:06:02,770 --> 01:06:04,925
I want you to think about that again

910
01:06:05,514 --> 01:06:08,871
What happens if the shipping company and the loading contract are settled,
the loading day is approaching,

911
01:06:09,457 --> 01:06:12,847
but the crucial goods cannot be obtained?

912
01:06:14,094 --> 01:06:16,043
Please consider our position

913
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,480
Eh, Matsuyama-san, of course, We've brought this for you

914
01:06:28,170 --> 01:06:30,170
I'm asking you to somehow run
around and gather the items for us.

915
01:06:35,210 --> 01:06:36,038
Please.

916
01:06:39,257 --> 01:06:42,014
You know there's going to be problems if you break your contract with us.

917
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,850
You must have been prepared for something like that

918
01:06:45,482 --> 01:06:47,326
Are you trying to uphold Fuji's reputation until then?

919
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,444
Isn't the reputation of all Japanese traders more important than that of Fuji?

920
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,716
Please consider that

921
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,467
Please.

922
01:07:01,303 --> 01:07:03,090
Please.
Matsushima-san

923
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:13,332
I received a telegram from you last night.

924
01:07:13,450 --> 01:07:16,344
I was just thinking about reconsidering things

925
01:07:16,540 --> 01:07:17,313
I'm really grateful,

926
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:18,321
please do it

927
01:07:19,189 --> 01:07:20,165
Well...

928
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,696
Starting tomorrow, we'll be storing all the goods in the warehouse for a week

929
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:27,995
And it's wonderful, isn't it

930
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,400
We're glad.

931
01:07:30,682 --> 01:07:31,860
Thank you very much.

932
01:07:47,173 --> 01:07:50,181
Make sure to check them

933
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,689
Everything is ok

934
01:07:59,134 --> 01:08:00,556
Check this

935
01:08:12,727 --> 01:08:17,415
beautiful decorations
are made by the hands of poor women

936
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:19,829
I felt sorry watching that

937
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:23,594
Well, it's like we're feeding those women

938
01:08:27,798 --> 01:08:30,477
Oh, Kai, Kai, wait a minute,

939
01:08:31,125 --> 01:08:32,821
Keep going.

940
01:08:33,010 --> 01:08:33,386
This

941
01:08:34,017 --> 01:08:35,219
Ah, thank you

942
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:36,915
Ako-chan

943
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:39,546
Shall we go play in Osaka after work?

944
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:41,616
Please enjoy the soft-shelled turtle cuisine in Kyoto

945
01:08:42,095 --> 01:08:43,040
soft-shelled turtle cuisine?

946
01:08:43,444 --> 01:08:47,196
I really want to try soft-shelled turtle in Kyoto; I want to experience Katsuragikyu

947
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:49,759
What a drag, that's
not interesting at all

948
01:08:49,971 --> 01:08:51,079
it's not a temple

949
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:52,836
It's pretty much the same thing

950
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,657
That's no different from a landlord's content

951
01:08:58,054 --> 01:08:58,805
Is that so?

952
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,454
It looks beautiful in the photo

953
01:09:01,860 --> 01:09:03,436
It has a Japanese beauty

954
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,454
That Japanese beauty is the problem

955
01:09:06,860 --> 01:09:07,606
Why?

956
01:09:09,755 --> 01:09:15,180
Things like beauty and rust are just sad excuses for
losing in this poor country with so few resources

957
01:09:28,031 --> 01:09:36,031
"No excuse; if anyone has any information regarding
these lost items please step forward; 
accompanied by the culprit (dog) and prepared to be scolded."

958
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:49,594
It's not easy to sell, is it?

959
01:09:50,048 --> 01:09:52,635
I wonder when my sister will come back?

960
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:55,040
She's busy with work, you know

961
01:09:55,354 --> 01:09:58,354
I want to be with my mom,

962
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:04,915
but she is working hard to endure
that too,for you

963
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:09,169
It's okay that I'm poor

964
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,704
If I'm with my mom, I'll do anything,

965
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:19,680
Kenji.

966
01:10:19,705 --> 01:10:21,555
Let's try to meet mom soon, okay?

967
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,680
I want.

968
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:24,540
We are KonKonchiki

969
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:25,290
Come on.

970
01:10:26,118 --> 01:10:26,986
Ino-san

971
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,274
(Inosan-tablet)

972
01:10:33,290 --> 01:10:36,212
I don't remember much about my dad,

973
01:10:36,237 --> 01:10:38,266
Ino-san is like my dad today,

974
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,126
but having a best friend is better than a dad

975
01:10:44,102 --> 01:10:45,071
Hello?

976
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,876
This is mine,

977
01:10:50,227 --> 01:10:51,274
oh, I'm sorry.

978
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:53,040
Ken-chan

979
01:10:53,806 --> 01:10:55,790
Say sorry

980
01:10:58,404 --> 01:10:59,329
I'm sorry

981
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,266
I'm glad it went well;

982
01:11:07,891 --> 01:11:08,837
I'm really happy.

983
01:11:12,064 --> 01:11:13,329
 Thank you very much

984
01:11:13,689 --> 01:11:15,899
Well, we both have our struggles,

985
01:11:40,001 --> 01:11:41,790
Oops,This is a song about heartbreak.

986
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:43,579
I'll stop.

987
01:11:44,657 --> 01:11:47,930
I'm not good at anything other than business.

988
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:49,587
What?

989
01:11:51,610 --> 01:11:52,438
Hey, Ako-chan

990
01:11:52,910 --> 01:11:56,368
Once this job is done, I think I'll leave the company and become independent

991
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:57,782
That's nice

992
01:11:58,840 --> 01:12:00,540
Let's do it together

993
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:03,259
I have high expectations for you, Ako-chan

994
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,266
Dad's ban has been lifted

995
01:12:12,290 --> 01:12:13,852
He says he's going to start a company again

996
01:12:14,180 --> 01:12:15,501
He has a lot to do with the South Seas countries.

997
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,211
so let's travel the world together

998
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:22,126
My dad was just a partner in South Seas countries.

999
01:12:22,150 --> 01:12:23,352
but I'm doing business with the world

1000
01:12:24,363 --> 01:12:26,134
If it's Kaji-san, I think you'll succeed

1001
01:12:27,052 --> 01:12:28,759
So is it OK?

1002
01:12:29,486 --> 01:12:30,157
What?

1003
01:12:30,814 --> 01:12:31,947
Is it OK to get married?

1004
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:34,856
Wait

1005
01:12:36,539 --> 01:12:38,680
Why is that?

1006
01:12:39,644 --> 01:12:40,680
that's rude

1007
01:12:41,945 --> 01:12:42,938
Do you dislike me?

1008
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:46,220
It's not that I dislike you,but you scared me

1009
01:13:01,219 --> 01:13:02,165
You're so calm.

1010
01:13:04,638 --> 01:13:05,891
It's not that I'm calm,

1011
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,743
but it's such an important matter

1012
01:13:12,329 --> 01:13:13,821
I want to think about it slowly

1013
01:13:16,190 --> 01:13:19,555
You know, You have a very feudal character.

1014
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,460
That might be true. Once you enter a family,

1015
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,899
I might unexpectedly become a boring housewife

1016
01:13:27,834 --> 01:13:29,696
You're too modest

1017
01:13:36,023 --> 01:13:43,516
But sometimes I feel that living a life solely
focused on my business isn't really a true life

1018
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:54,602
I wonder if there are more truths
in the world that I don't know about

1019
01:14:12,118 --> 01:14:13,977
How about you moving to Tokyo?

1020
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:18,891
Oh, if you're considering it, should I
talk to my company about it?

1021
01:14:19,165 --> 01:14:20,111
Thank you.

1022
01:14:21,429 --> 01:14:23,525
But There is a problem with the house

1023
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,846
If you like, you can live in my house.

1024
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:30,516
But I think you'll be getting married soon.

1025
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:34,219
No, I really can't do that

1026
01:14:41,970 --> 01:14:43,352
I'm really sorry.

1027
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,676
After all, He is a bad dog

1028
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,176
From now on, Please keep the dog on a strict chain.

1029
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:49,798
Sorry

1030
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:03,970
Sorry.

1031
01:15:04,308 --> 01:15:07,493
We can't take care of Peke anymore

1032
01:15:09,230 --> 01:15:10,746
I will give Nana to Ken-chan

1033
01:15:10,770 --> 01:15:12,688
Isn't Nana much cuter?

1034
01:15:13,445 --> 01:15:15,852
Pedigree is important for dogs

1035
01:15:16,454 --> 01:15:18,212
Peke, say sorry.

1036
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:21,930
Please, could you take Peke and leave it?

1037
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:25,134
Oh, Nana

1038
01:15:25,432 --> 01:15:26,560
Good, good, good.

1039
01:15:28,356 --> 01:15:30,205
I understand, it must be tough for Ken-chan

1040
01:15:30,230 --> 01:15:33,230
Well then, let's ask someone him throw it away for us

1041
01:15:36,677 --> 01:15:39,677
Alright, alright, I see, I see,

1042
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:41,736
I'm going now

1043
01:15:44,704 --> 01:15:46,376
I'm going now

1044
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:01,524
You'll be taken care of by someone, got it?

1045
01:16:01,736 --> 01:16:02,322
Peke.

1046
01:17:25,298 --> 01:17:26,298
Peke.

1047
01:17:26,931 --> 01:17:28,103
Peke.

1048
01:17:30,626 --> 01:17:31,236
Peke.

1049
01:17:32,821 --> 01:17:35,009
I'm sorry

1050
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:52,149
I'm sorry, but I can't take you home

1051
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,641
I'm going to have Ino-san take care of you, I'm not throwing you away, I'm leaving you with him.

1052
01:18:00,117 --> 01:18:01,546
Oh Kin-chan?

1053
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:03,821
I'm not Kin but Ken.

1054
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,688
Ah, Gin?

1055
01:18:08,180 --> 01:18:10,587
Niheita's not home.

1056
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:12,720
He won't be able to return?

1057
01:18:12,866 --> 01:18:14,652
Isn't he coming home tonight?

1058
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,969
He is on a business trip.

1059
01:18:18,250 --> 01:18:20,844
He probably won't be coming home tonight.

1060
01:18:46,041 --> 01:18:46,525
Let's go

1061
01:18:49,302 --> 01:18:50,400
Let's go

1062
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,704
Well, It is unusual to see you.

1063
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,821
When did you back?

1064
01:19:28,307 --> 01:19:29,883
I just arrived now

1065
01:19:30,689 --> 01:19:32,716
Ah, Ken-chan didn't come back yesterday

1066
01:19:32,741 --> 01:19:34,088
Really?

1067
01:19:34,685 --> 01:19:37,685
Oh, that's terrible. What happened?

1068
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:40,306
Did he not visit here yesterday?

1069
01:19:41,473 --> 01:19:45,571
I went to see Ken-chan's mother while I was on a business trip here yesterday

1070
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,548
Did you call Hakone?

1071
01:19:49,842 --> 01:19:53,923
No, my mother didn't want to worry
Kagawa-san and didn't call

1072
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:57,418
He didn't come while I was there.

1073
01:19:57,947 --> 01:19:59,074
I wonder where she went?

1074
01:20:00,707 --> 01:20:01,559
Please wait a moment

1075
01:20:13,317 --> 01:20:15,903
He's with Peke so he must be in Tokyo.

1076
01:20:17,004 --> 01:20:19,765
in Asakusa or Ueno, though

1077
01:20:19,790 --> 01:20:22,043
I'll ask my company for permission and go look for him.

1078
01:20:24,930 --> 01:20:27,746
I'll also take a day off to search for it

1079
01:20:27,770 --> 01:20:29,160
So, shall we go together?

1080
01:20:29,262 --> 01:20:30,990
Oh, I'm fine going alone,

1081
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,015
I wouldn't mind going alone either

1082
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,846
Yes, I think it's more convenient with two people

1083
01:20:36,870 --> 01:20:39,870
Oh, then just a moment.

1084
01:20:51,856 --> 01:20:52,824
Bros.

1085
01:20:56,187 --> 01:20:59,074
I'll be careful around Asakusa

1086
01:20:59,099 --> 01:21:00,219
Please

1087
01:21:00,530 --> 01:21:02,766
More importantly, it's a bad trend that you're coming home late every night

1088
01:21:02,790 --> 01:21:04,236
I changed my part-time job

1089
01:21:04,260 --> 01:21:05,394
Please don't worry

1090
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:06,332
I worry

1091
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:08,566
Did you work at a nightclub?

1092
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,989
Well then, I'm off

1093
01:21:26,434 --> 01:21:29,949
The only person taken into custody at the police station here last night was a runaway girl.

1094
01:22:38,077 --> 01:22:38,933
Aren’t tired?

1095
01:22:45,801 --> 01:22:49,380
The other day, The street children were having fun playing

1096
01:22:52,430 --> 01:22:54,676
Ken-chan must have also wandered off from home,

1097
01:22:55,970 --> 01:22:58,970
It was wrong to try to make him abandon his pet

1098
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,540
However, the name 'Peke' is utterly ridiculous

1099
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:04,199
Because it really is Peke

1100
01:23:04,690 --> 01:23:06,230
Even if a pushy salesperson comes

1101
01:23:06,255 --> 01:23:07,121
He's happy

1102
01:23:07,146 --> 01:23:09,011
He's a good-natured one

1103
01:23:10,072 --> 01:23:11,090
He doesn't naturally doubt people

1104
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:18,023
As you said, he's lazy

1105
01:23:18,457 --> 01:23:20,098
He's good character

1106
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:22,465
Well, it's strange to say that a dog is nice,

1107
01:23:23,988 --> 01:23:27,308
I like those kind-hearted dogs

1108
01:23:27,890 --> 01:23:29,879
It becomes a problem when you're the one taking care of him

1109
01:23:33,870 --> 01:23:36,870
As long as you have him, you have to love both the maid and the pekes equally

1110
01:23:38,926 --> 01:23:39,895
We do

1111
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:45,199
Well, it's because he wags his tails at everyone, it's a sign of loneliness

1112
01:23:47,800 --> 01:23:49,034
Even Ken-chan is like that.

1113
01:23:49,857 --> 01:23:50,980
It's because he's lonely.

1114
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,859
I'm sorry, dear

1115
01:24:10,170 --> 01:24:11,023
Shall we go?

1116
01:24:12,151 --> 01:24:13,570
I'll search by myself

1117
01:24:17,810 --> 01:24:18,382
Atsuko!

1118
01:25:00,801 --> 01:25:02,015
Hmm... I wonder what happened to Kenji.

1119
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:11,960
Is it a souvenir for Kenji?

1120
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:15,265
I bought this at Hamamachi station

1121
01:25:17,697 --> 01:25:19,054
Shall we grab a bite to eat?

1122
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:22,352
Let's go to the loach restaurant that I went to with Ken-chan.

1123
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:23,968
Let's visit that place once

1124
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:34,719
Yo, Yo-chan

1125
01:25:44,429 --> 01:25:46,250
Welcome

1126
01:25:46,845 --> 01:25:47,423
Good evening!

1127
01:25:47,586 --> 01:25:48,727
Welcome

1128
01:25:53,938 --> 01:25:54,720
Welcome

1129
01:25:55,167 --> 01:25:56,243
Please come in

1130
01:25:58,423 --> 01:25:59,188
Welcome

1131
01:26:01,498 --> 01:26:03,334
I wonder if Ken-chan didn't come?

1132
01:26:03,749 --> 01:26:06,500
No,I also looked around him here

1133
01:26:07,755 --> 01:26:09,204
Thank you very much

1134
01:26:11,370 --> 01:26:12,676
I'll pay on credit today.

1135
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,125
Don't worry, senpai

1136
01:26:15,410 --> 01:26:18,410
I want to order soil and beer

1137
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:21,504
How about this today?

1138
01:26:22,933 --> 01:26:24,175
I'll have it

1139
01:26:24,942 --> 01:26:26,980
A soil and beer

1140
01:26:31,301 --> 01:26:32,223
Do you smoke?

1141
01:26:32,926 --> 01:26:33,614
No.

1142
01:26:34,959 --> 01:26:36,683
Well, sometimes it's nice to be in places like this, right?

1143
01:26:37,379 --> 01:26:38,723
It's nothing

1144
01:26:41,676 --> 01:26:42,543
welcome.

1145
01:26:42,852 --> 01:26:44,778
Ken-chan is in a grave?

1146
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,810
We are going to search him again from now on

1147
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:52,180
Masako. Is this job the reason you come home late?

1148
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:54,440
This is also a lesson for life

1149
01:26:54,598 --> 01:26:55,285
Come on.

1150
01:26:55,577 --> 01:26:57,996
Masako didn't said anything to you?

1151
01:26:58,508 --> 01:27:01,508
Are you guys also playing the kon-kon-chiki?

1152
01:27:02,208 --> 01:27:03,207
That's right,

1153
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:04,135
it's the kon-kon-chiki moon.

1154
01:27:08,379 --> 01:27:10,582
Please work with the spirit of boat racing in mind.

1155
01:27:11,737 --> 01:27:12,363
Don't worry.

1156
01:27:14,365 --> 01:27:17,365
I'm getting a little help from Masako-san, which is a big help

1157
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:18,465
Oh no..

1158
01:27:34,346 --> 01:27:35,158
It's delicious.

1159
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:37,971
I was surprised

1160
01:27:38,280 --> 01:27:39,533
Am I not allowed to drink?

1161
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:41,822
I can't stand to see a drunken woman.

1162
01:27:42,530 --> 01:27:43,894
I won't get drunk

1163
01:27:44,210 --> 01:27:46,306
I can't agree with a woman who drinks too much

1164
01:27:46,330 --> 01:27:48,696
I also really dislike men who drink too much

1165
01:27:54,597 --> 01:27:55,500
It's fine to drink

1166
01:27:56,180 --> 01:28:01,420
but what I dislike is a lazy person who only
drinks and seems to have no other thoughts

1167
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:03,972
Maybe it's me

1168
01:28:05,276 --> 01:28:09,480
What do you think about Atsuko,Afureko(voice acting),Afureko's child?

1169
01:28:11,427 --> 01:28:14,427
That means you're just a slave to the company.

1170
01:28:15,168 --> 01:28:16,543
You're mean.

1171
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:20,193
Well, It's fine with the big companies

1172
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:23,224
Just like Inoda-san, being laid-back and carefree

1173
01:28:23,342 --> 01:28:25,230
Do you think so?

1174
01:28:29,450 --> 01:28:32,450
Mr. Inoda is not seriously facing life

1175
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:34,699
He is commonly known as Hanpeita

1176
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:48,531
What is life?

1177
01:28:50,070 --> 01:28:53,933
Business is not life, and life is not
just about living.

1178
01:28:53,958 --> 01:28:55,028
I understand

1179
01:28:56,087 --> 01:28:59,087
But you see, life is not just about living

1180
01:28:59,340 --> 01:29:01,738
Besides, it's not about living a life.

1181
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:10,691
I'm envious of you.

1182
01:29:12,887 --> 01:29:16,434
You get to talk about life with such a beautiful wife.

1183
01:29:20,754 --> 01:29:22,551
I really understand that now

1184
01:29:24,332 --> 01:29:25,473
Sorry.

1185
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:27,270
I'm having fun

1186
01:29:29,207 --> 01:29:31,129
I'm enjoying my life

1187
01:29:52,691 --> 01:29:55,433
 How about you?

1188
01:29:55,910 --> 01:29:58,165
 Anyway, let's call Ken-chan's mother right away

1189
01:29:58,190 --> 01:30:01,190
She seem like a nice person with a tough exterior, gentle and beautiful

1190
01:30:02,870 --> 01:30:09,019
If it's inconvenient for you, I might have to file a missing person report

1191
01:30:09,192 --> 01:30:14,028
but no, I won't worry my aunt like that, I'll find them

1192
01:30:14,610 --> 01:30:17,246
I have a responsibility, you know

1193
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:21,699
Are you taking care of him out of responsibility or out of love?

1194
01:30:24,700 --> 01:30:26,074
If you have that much love,

1195
01:30:26,099 --> 01:30:30,019
you should marry Ken-chan's mother and make Ken-chan happy

1196
01:30:30,750 --> 01:30:31,613
What did you say?

1197
01:30:35,676 --> 01:30:36,676
If it weren't for Ako,

1198
01:30:36,701 --> 01:30:37,621
I might have slapped you

1199
01:30:39,107 --> 01:30:42,107
Oh, Inoda-san, did you just insult me?

1200
01:30:43,387 --> 01:30:45,387
You're also insulting Ken-chan's mother

1201
01:30:51,918 --> 01:30:52,840
Atsuko

1202
01:30:53,873 --> 01:30:57,379
The real Ako-chan shouldn't be like this

1203
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:24,351
Inoda-san seems different from that Inoda-san today

1204
01:31:53,614 --> 01:31:54,934
I'm off.

1205
01:31:55,629 --> 01:31:56,528
Ako!

1206
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,614
Beer please.

1207
01:32:26,034 --> 01:32:28,198
Good morning

1208
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:29,418
Good morning

1209
01:32:30,145 --> 01:32:30,918
Good morning

1210
01:32:31,153 --> 01:32:32,840
Good morning

1211
01:32:32,865 --> 01:32:34,348
Inoda-san,Congratulations.

1212
01:32:34,567 --> 01:32:35,332
Congratulations.

1213
01:32:37,176 --> 01:32:38,567
What's wrong?

1214
01:32:40,028 --> 01:32:41,035
Don't you know about this?

1215
01:32:41,703 --> 01:32:43,573
I received a contract from Malcom Company.

1216
01:32:44,864 --> 01:32:47,199
That's good

1217
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:50,883
Congratulations.

1218
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:56,938
I think Japan would be very happy if we could secure a contract for that drug.

1219
01:32:59,301 --> 01:33:00,727
I'm honored to receive your praise

1220
01:33:01,650 --> 01:33:04,306
Hmm, I have three requests regarding this

1221
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:07,156
Three?

1222
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:09,956
First of all,since we're finally able to get it

1223
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:13,570
I would like to have a rehabilitation facility that accommodates employees like Ito-kun

1224
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:15,664
Sure, that sounds good

1225
01:33:17,560 --> 01:33:18,781
And?

1226
01:33:20,555 --> 01:33:21,868
I would like you to hire one more person

1227
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,680
She's called Kagawa Kayo who is War widow.

1228
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:28,636
Well, what about the other one?

1229
01:33:28,660 --> 01:33:30,461
I'd like to take another day off

1230
01:33:31,133 --> 01:33:31,953
Please

1231
01:33:36,383 --> 01:33:37,558
That's just ridiculous.

1232
01:33:37,724 --> 01:33:39,880
But this is Matsushima's story

1233
01:33:40,170 --> 01:33:45,367
Actually, the one who was bothering you was Inoda's colleague

1234
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:49,609
Did Inoda really ask you to bring that out no matter what?

1235
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:52,800
I'm getting motivated about it

1236
01:33:56,390 --> 01:33:59,250
I must go to Fuji Trading and say thank them.

1237
01:34:05,125 --> 01:34:06,205
Shima.

1238
01:34:07,515 --> 01:34:08,648
I'm off.

1239
01:34:09,100 --> 01:34:11,316
But the business has completely succeeded, hasn't it?

1240
01:34:11,340 --> 01:34:12,826
It's based on people's thoughts, you know

1241
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:14,076
That's not the issue

1242
01:34:14,100 --> 01:34:16,386
It was us who made Reference Trading Company a reality

1243
01:34:16,410 --> 01:34:19,494
Yes, exactly, thank you

1244
01:34:32,523 --> 01:34:35,541
Ako-chan, there's nothing to be down

1245
01:34:37,050 --> 01:34:40,050
If you have complaints, we'll take all the complaints next time

1246
01:34:40,510 --> 01:34:42,445
It's 1 million yen
that can fulfill 10%

1247
01:34:44,527 --> 01:34:47,527
But don't we need to reflect on this?

1248
01:34:47,884 --> 01:34:48,457
Reflection?

1249
01:34:49,932 --> 01:34:51,840
Reflecting won't change a thing, will it?

1250
01:34:58,055 --> 01:35:00,453
Yes, yes, it's me

1251
01:35:03,060 --> 01:35:05,198
Well, the Shinagawa
Technical Consultation Office?

1252
01:35:05,404 --> 01:35:07,382
Yes, thank you for yesterday

1253
01:35:08,415 --> 01:35:11,415
Hello, about this matter...

1254
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,186
This morning... I heard they took in a child about Ken-chan's age

1255
01:35:13,210 --> 01:35:15,673
They say they took him in at the Sarajou Academy in Kokubunji

1256
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:19,350
Ah? No, no, the name is different, though

1257
01:35:19,740 --> 01:35:21,306
They say he's walking a dog

1258
01:35:21,343 --> 01:35:22,641
He must be Kenji

1259
01:35:23,352 --> 01:35:24,928
I will be there right away

1260
01:35:29,376 --> 01:35:31,005
Just ignore someone else's kid like that

1261
01:35:31,030 --> 01:35:32,220
The police will look for him

1262
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:33,487
It won't go that way.

1263
01:35:34,100 --> 01:35:35,879
More importantly, let's do it together

1264
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:38,266
The next job is interesting because I deal with a lot of cult leaders

1265
01:35:38,290 --> 01:35:39,749
You can really savor the essence of business

1266
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:42,344
I'm currently busy looking for Ken-chan,

1267
01:35:43,142 --> 01:35:46,142
Once you find him, It's best not to get involved with vagrant children like that.

1268
01:35:49,768 --> 01:35:53,526
Do you have pocket money?

1269
01:35:56,198 --> 01:35:58,220
If so,bring it for the taxi fare

1270
01:35:58,530 --> 01:35:59,300
I have some

1271
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:08,583
Mr. Kai, There's a call from Mogi campamy.

1272
01:36:12,066 --> 01:36:13,246
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

1273
01:36:13,411 --> 01:36:15,925
The situation here is stagnant, but

1274
01:36:15,950 --> 01:36:17,151
However, it is showing strong signs

1275
01:36:17,488 --> 01:36:19,011
The market is strong.

1276
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:30,452
I definitely think it's Kenji

1277
01:36:31,856 --> 01:36:33,975
Please take a look

1278
01:36:35,815 --> 01:36:38,765
But it would be unfortunate if it's wrong

1279
01:36:38,987 --> 01:36:40,481
Please view from a distance.

1280
01:36:40,726 --> 01:36:41,589
I understood.

1281
01:37:05,999 --> 01:37:07,132
Atsuko!

1282
01:37:09,451 --> 01:37:10,158
Atsuko!

1283
01:37:13,852 --> 01:37:15,181
Ken-chan

1284
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:16,698
Peke

1285
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:18,395
I knew he was here

1286
01:37:18,456 --> 01:37:19,202
I'm glad

1287
01:37:23,367 --> 01:37:24,221
Kenji

1288
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:26,838
Ken-chan

1289
01:37:28,799 --> 01:37:30,086
Ken-chan

1290
01:37:30,811 --> 01:37:31,825
Ken-chan

1291
01:37:33,288 --> 01:37:34,975
Ken-chan

1292
01:37:41,886 --> 01:37:42,973
Ken-chan

1293
01:37:48,295 --> 01:37:49,322
Kenji

1294
01:37:51,028 --> 01:37:51,901
Ken-chan

1295
01:38:01,869 --> 01:38:02,996
Ino!

1296
01:38:03,460 --> 01:38:04,713
Atsuko sis.

1297
01:38:14,698 --> 01:38:15,652
Atsuko

1298
01:38:19,131 --> 01:38:19,871
Ino!

1299
01:38:54,883 --> 01:38:58,232
I have something I need to apologize to Inoda-san for

1300
01:39:00,695 --> 01:39:01,882
I just found out this morning

1301
01:39:02,189 --> 01:39:03,415
About Mr. Bradford

1302
01:39:05,236 --> 01:39:08,236
Well, you must have had quite a hard time

1303
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:09,371
I’m sorry

1304
01:39:10,476 --> 01:39:11,156
No....

1305
01:39:20,629 --> 01:39:22,350
Aren't we going to take a break?

1306
01:39:24,928 --> 01:39:26,302
ken-chan!

1307
01:39:27,468 --> 01:39:28,568
Shall we have a rest?

1308
01:39:35,264 --> 01:39:36,170
Shall we have a rest?

1309
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:01,720
I thought I had been living earnestly until now.

1310
01:40:03,415 --> 01:40:06,957
I thought my serious way of living was my life as it is

1311
01:40:07,454 --> 01:40:14,092
But I feel like I'm finally starting to understand that there are many things in life that I don't know

1312
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:19,466
No, I have learned a lot from Atsuko-san

1313
01:40:20,767 --> 01:40:22,620
Same here.

1314
01:40:25,038 --> 01:40:26,679
You said to me once

1315
01:40:27,569 --> 01:40:30,289
I thought I wasn't living seriously.

1316
01:40:33,276 --> 01:40:35,563
I'm sorry for being cheeky

1317
01:40:36,398 --> 01:40:38,165
Same here.

1318
01:40:48,714 --> 01:40:51,005
Atsuko-san, why aren't
you getting married?

1319
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,340
Huh? Inoda-san,you too.

1320
01:40:55,396 --> 01:40:56,281
Me?

1321
01:40:58,227 --> 01:41:01,925
Actually,there was someone I thought about marrying before

1322
01:41:03,059 --> 01:41:06,059
She married someone else while I was away at war.

1323
01:41:10,330 --> 01:41:15,445
Since then, I have had a distrust of women.

1324
01:41:18,776 --> 01:41:21,035
I have had such experiences.

1325
01:41:22,447 --> 01:41:23,378
Engaged?

1326
01:41:24,590 --> 01:41:25,926
He died in battle.

1327
01:41:35,700 --> 01:41:38,105
Atsuko-san is also a victim of the war as a doctor

1328
01:41:38,359 --> 01:41:40,972
I hate to say this,
but actually,

1329
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,156
you know...

1330
01:41:43,180 --> 01:41:47,042
Recently, I finally met a woman who I think is the one for me

1331
01:41:47,724 --> 01:41:49,930
When I took Kenji to Asakusa,

1332
01:41:49,970 --> 01:41:56,027
While walking, I decided to clearly express my feelings to that person

1333
01:41:56,490 --> 01:41:58,285
So? What did you do then?

1334
01:41:59,107 --> 01:42:01,588
Well, just when I thought I would show my confess

1335
01:42:01,693 --> 01:42:04,311
I ended up meeting Kaji

1336
01:42:04,336 --> 01:42:05,740
and it didn't go well

1337
01:42:05,854 --> 01:42:06,568
Oh...

1338
01:42:08,440 --> 01:42:10,400
I'm indirectly confessing my feelings to you.

1339
01:42:12,248 --> 01:42:12,981
Not at all.

1340
01:42:15,471 --> 01:42:16,125
I'm off.

1341
01:42:19,457 --> 01:42:20,043
Ako.

1342
01:42:23,811 --> 01:42:25,031
Atsuko sis!

1343
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:30,142
It's a great view!

1344
01:42:31,169 --> 01:42:32,182
Be careful.

1345
01:42:32,680 --> 01:42:34,463
It's Hakone there, right?

1346
01:42:37,965 --> 01:42:38,611
Yes, that's right

1347
01:42:38,779 --> 01:42:41,365
Your mom might be on the Odakyu line right about now

1348
01:42:41,830 --> 01:42:43,967
That's good, alright, I'm fine now

1349
01:42:50,212 --> 01:42:51,172
Are you fine now?

1350
01:43:18,170 --> 01:43:26,009
THE END

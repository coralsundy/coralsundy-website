2
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:48,469
Run away!

3
00:00:49,453 --> 00:00:51,180
Run away!

4
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,156
Run away!

5
00:01:00,352 --> 00:01:01,070
Run away!

6
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:10,859
It's dangerous because it collapses!

7
00:01:24,883 --> 00:01:32,695
The School of Spies 2:
Cloud One Command

8
00:02:21,188 --> 00:02:22,664
September 1945

9
00:02:23,555 --> 00:02:25,906
I graduated from Nakano School of the Army

10
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:31,945
I headed north on the Korean Peninsula towards my new mission, Beijing

11
00:02:36,117 --> 00:02:37,609
Is there Jiro Shiina?

12
00:02:38,313 --> 00:02:39,039
Is there Jiro Shiina?

13
00:02:41,047 --> 00:02:42,305
Is there Jiro Shiina?

14
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,273
Is there Jiro Shiina?

15
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,508
Is there Jiro Shiina?

16
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,352
Excuse me

17
00:02:57,617 --> 00:02:58,875
I'm the Jiro Shiina

18
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,656
This is a telegram to you

19
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:01,836
Thanks

20
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:15,562
This was a coded message informing me that my mission had changed.

21
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,375
I was to turn back based on the command

22
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:41,367
KOBE

23
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:45,977
Was the cargo ship destroyed by a time bomb?

24
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:48,422
I think so

25
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:54,961
Look at that.
The accident site is that area

26
00:03:56,930 --> 00:03:57,648
Victims?

27
00:03:58,398 --> 00:04:02,180
All 94 executives died

28
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:07,023
And A new bomb was on the ship

29
00:04:07,953 --> 00:04:09,109
What is that?

30
00:04:10,914 --> 00:04:15,203
A new type of bomb recently developed by the Army

31
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:18,734
This was going to be used in the war

32
00:04:20,258 --> 00:04:22,906
Did they aim for the bomb?

33
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,219
I don't know yet

34
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:30,797
That new bomb was a military secret

35
00:04:31,906 --> 00:04:34,625
It's unlikely that those plans were leaked to the outside world.

36
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:42,484
So there was a directive to investigate this case

37
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:48,023
An order came to the school in us and  the local Kobe army

38
00:04:48,797 --> 00:04:49,516
To our school?

39
00:04:52,516 --> 00:04:55,727
To be honest,
I wanted the investigation

40
00:04:59,992 --> 00:05:00,656
Listen

41
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,375
I built Nakano School with my own strong beliefs.

42
00:05:05,953 --> 00:05:10,367
I've worked incredibly hard all year.

43
00:05:12,484 --> 00:05:17,547
Graduates went to the battlefield with their respective missions after graduation

44
00:05:19,414 --> 00:05:25,789
I believe they will be active in the war

45
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:34,813
Of course it is difficult to expect their results immediately

46
00:05:35,766 --> 00:05:39,953
But I want the results sooner

47
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:48,062
So I asked the Kobe army and you for that

48
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:54,367
I want you to prove that the training at Nakano School is correct.

49
00:05:56,758 --> 00:05:57,500
I get it

50
00:05:58,852 --> 00:06:00,773
I will do my best for the honor of the school

51
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:10,445
I'm glad to hear that

52
00:06:12,578 --> 00:06:16,242
Sugimoto has a little bit of that information

53
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,781
According to his explanation

54
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:29,453
It seems that my house is prepared around here

55
00:06:42,563 --> 00:06:43,859
Are you the new residence?

56
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,430
Yes

57
00:06:44,516 --> 00:06:47,422
I thought you would come soon

58
00:06:48,055 --> 00:06:50,289
I'm your maid, Tame.
Thank you

59
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,430
Are you Jiro Shiina?

60
00:06:54,984 --> 00:06:56,352
Where did you move from?

61
00:06:56,664 --> 00:06:57,438
From Tokyo

62
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,625
How old are you?

63
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,164
I'm 24

64
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:06,523
Were you in the army?
You look strong

65
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:08,445
I was at 1st camp

66
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh the 1st camp

67
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:13,602
What's your job?

68
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:16,617
I am a product of Toa Institute of Economic Research

69
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,047
Institute of Economic Research?

70
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,523
About that?

71
00:07:22,555 --> 00:07:23,609
What do you mean?

72
00:07:23,953 --> 00:07:25,039
Don't pretend you don't know

73
00:07:25,406 --> 00:07:26,508
Left wing

74
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:30,938
No way,
I am an employee of a government agency

75
00:07:38,102 --> 00:07:38,836
I see

76
00:07:39,711 --> 00:07:42,727
Toa Institute of Economic Research

77
00:07:44,203 --> 00:07:49,461
My place of work was on the campus of the university

78
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:55,914
This was a great place to contact Mr. Sugimoto, who is already investigating.

79
00:07:57,609 --> 00:07:59,758
Mr. Sugimoto did not appear for some reason

80
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,281
I went to the wharf

81
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,406
The time bomb should have been set up here

82
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:25,148
Get ready!

83
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,164
Get in!

84
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,602
Hey!
What are you doing?

85
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,094
Nothing special

86
00:08:43,266 --> 00:08:44,039
Come with me!

87
00:09:04,438 --> 00:09:04,969
Stay here

88
00:09:07,227 --> 00:09:07,969
You are the next

89
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:10,289
Come

90
00:09:16,109 --> 00:09:16,891
What they asked you about?

91
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:22,070
They say there are spies in us

92
00:09:22,352 --> 00:09:23,219
Spy?

93
00:09:23,391 --> 00:09:29,789
I was told I wouldn't return tonight if I didn't say the name of the suspicious person

94
00:09:33,023 --> 00:09:34,781
They are like Yakuza

95
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:38,125
Sit down

96
00:09:43,391 --> 00:09:44,797
Tell me your Name and profession

97
00:09:45,344 --> 00:09:46,266
I'm Jiro Shiina

98
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:47,680
What's your job

99
00:09:50,484 --> 00:09:51,563
What's your job

100
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:53,938
I work in the army

101
00:09:57,453 --> 00:09:58,609
Don't make fun of me

102
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:01,195
I won't hit you

103
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,539
Your hairstyle is not a second lieutenant

104
00:10:08,492 --> 00:10:12,070
You can find out if you look up my background

105
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,359
That's interesting

106
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,750
Ok, I'll look into you

107
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,375
Be ready for anything.

108
00:10:25,477 --> 00:10:26,445
Shiina

109
00:10:26,883 --> 00:10:27,680
Hinata

110
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:32,820
I'm Captain Yamaoka

111
00:10:33,422 --> 00:10:34,773
I'm sorry to bother you

112
00:10:36,055 --> 00:10:39,352
Forget this case

113
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:40,492
Sure

114
00:10:41,594 --> 00:10:45,195
I'm going.
If you need any help please contact me

115
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:56,813
Please be careful not to disturb me in our work

116
00:11:01,102 --> 00:11:02,250
You were in trouble

117
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:05,195
I'm sorry I was out

118
00:11:06,344 --> 00:11:08,023
I was too busy

119
00:11:09,031 --> 00:11:09,797
Were you busy?

120
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:12,398
I was doing various investigations

121
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:14,273
I had a news

122
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:19,633
keppei unit seems to have set up a time bomb

123
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:21,984
They made various plans

124
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:25,930
Suspicious are workers working in groups

125
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:28,797
The night watchman who patrols in the middle of the night is suspicious

126
00:11:29,094 --> 00:11:29,688
I see

127
00:11:30,281 --> 00:11:32,648
I want to investigate inside

128
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:36,531
I'm marking one person

129
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:37,695
Who?

130
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,328
Ichiro Motokawa

131
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:42,109
He's 38 years old, single

132
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:02,484
From the next day I followed Mr. Motokawa

133
00:12:03,531 --> 00:12:08,672
He went home as soon as the night guard work was over

134
00:12:10,531 --> 00:12:15,414
He eats at a nearby dining room at noon

135
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:29,297
He goes to the public bath at 2 pm

136
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,414
He is living a regular life like this

137
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:47,922
A day

138
00:13:14,258 --> 00:13:15,328
Excuse me

139
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:45,961
I'm home

140
00:13:58,233 --> 00:14:02,046
He met a geisha woman.
It's unnatural

141
00:14:03,445 --> 00:14:06,687
She is the most popular in that place

142
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:09,225
Is she local?

143
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:13,186
She seems to have moved half a year ago

144
00:14:15,116 --> 00:14:18,421
She was born in Niigata.
She's moved a lot

145
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:22,811
I just heard the information at a nearby tobacco shop

146
00:14:24,577 --> 00:14:27,897
Her identity is being investigated at Nakano School

147
00:14:29,983 --> 00:14:32,467
I hear they're not busy at school.

148
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:37,084
By the way,
Will you go out with me tomorrow?

149
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:45,506
According to what I hear, unconfirmed radio waves are being transmitted from Kobe.

150
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,397
That's a spy's wireless contact

151
00:14:49,366 --> 00:14:56,670
The starting point seems to be 1 km square around here.

152
00:14:57,835 --> 00:15:00,600
I think we should check the site

153
00:15:02,514 --> 00:15:03,710
Ok,let's go

154
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:06,866
Ok, then see you

155
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:23,311
Otokawa-san

156
00:15:24,155 --> 00:15:26,382
I hear you have a sister

157
00:15:26,407 --> 00:15:26,819
 a sister?

158
00:15:27,374 --> 00:15:29,389
I have no sister

159
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:33,030
It's strange.
You were with a young woman the other day.

160
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:37,671
So you have a girlfriend

161
00:15:37,696 --> 00:15:38,467
No way

162
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:40,046
Who told that?

163
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:42,710
I'm just kidding

164
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:47,842
Because you are single

165
00:15:49,202 --> 00:15:52,780
I had a terrible experience with women

166
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:55,514
Really?
Tell me about that

167
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,710
No way.
I don't want to remember it

168
00:15:59,967 --> 00:16:00,975
I will back to work

169
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:19,733
He may make suspicious gestures during the patrol

170
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:24,772
I've set up two patrols, starting tonight.

171
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,632
See what he will do

172
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:32,803
By the way, the site is around here

173
00:16:33,936 --> 00:16:37,585
There is a small park a little further ahead.
It is easier to understand from there

174
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,303
The left is the city.
The right is Yamamoto Street

175
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,217
Anyway let's walk around there

176
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:07,303
Oh. Are you Miyoshi?

177
00:17:08,507 --> 00:17:10,850
Oh,Sasaki

178
00:17:11,147 --> 00:17:14,647
It's been a long time.
How are you?

179
00:17:15,975 --> 00:17:17,428
She's my wife, Kuniko

180
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,530
Pleased to meet you

181
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:23,280
I'm Shiina

182
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:26,264
He was my classmate

183
00:17:27,491 --> 00:17:28,460
You've changed your work?

184
00:17:28,624 --> 00:17:29,171
Yes

185
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:31,772
You look fine

186
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:34,335
I've been busy.

187
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:38,046
I heard you are in the army now

188
00:17:39,413 --> 00:17:44,866
Now I'm working at the Toa Institute of Economic Research

189
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,975
I heard you joined Tomitsu company

190
00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:53,100
But I was immediately sent to China as a correspondent

191
00:17:54,788 --> 00:18:00,155
I wanted to tell the Japanese people about the situation of the war

192
00:18:01,147 --> 00:18:05,053
Now I'm a representative in Shanghai

193
00:18:05,538 --> 00:18:07,983
Do you have any good articles for us?

194
00:18:09,475 --> 00:18:10,592
Let me think

195
00:18:13,257 --> 00:18:17,569
The articles we write are too serious

196
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:21,296
He's busy so please stop talking anymore

197
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,358
Sorry, I didn't notice you are with him

198
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:26,873
Anyway think about it

199
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:30,882
Our office is in an easy to find location.

200
00:18:34,092 --> 00:18:35,741
There are various outsourced jobs

201
00:18:36,475 --> 00:18:39,030
I have to do a lot of work these days

202
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,335
See you then

203
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:54,585
He's a college friend but has nothing to do with me now

204
00:18:55,241 --> 00:18:57,780
There are many foreigners' houses around here.

205
00:18:59,342 --> 00:19:05,436
There may be a wireless antenna in some house

206
00:19:06,608 --> 00:19:09,819
They may be pretending to be a Japanese house

207
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:14,366
Many people in the upper class like foreign countries.

208
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,858
Is he a Christian?

209
00:19:24,647 --> 00:19:27,264
The man talking to that priest

210
00:19:28,741 --> 00:19:33,077
He is the master of the cafeteria when Motokawa always goes out for lunch

211
00:19:53,584 --> 00:20:00,686
Despite heavy security measures, another artillery transport ship is bombed and sunk.

212
00:20:08,514 --> 00:20:11,546
Was there a new bomb on that ship?

213
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,452
That ship was supposed to be 2nd

214
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:19,428
This damage is the second time

215
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:23,655
Spies are definitely aiming for new bombs

216
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:28,171
Where did the information that even we didn't know leak from?

217
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,624
I have no idea

218
00:20:30,382 --> 00:20:34,538
I thought I'd taken every precaution.

219
00:20:39,382 --> 00:20:41,007
I took them all

220
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:51,538
Army soldiers investigated the workers

221
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:57,312
I went to a public bath by the way

222
00:21:02,718 --> 00:21:07,827
Mr. motokawa did not come on time

223
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:09,866
I don't know why

224
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,218
She's late to come

225
00:21:21,437 --> 00:21:23,288
Don't be so rush

226
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:31,085
We've been waiting for an hour but never come

227
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:34,530
She's a disciplined woman. I'm sure he'll come.

228
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:38,749
Excuse me

229
00:21:45,163 --> 00:21:46,898
I'm sorry I'm late

230
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:49,132
We were waiting for you

231
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,350
Were you busy?

232
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:52,538
I'm sorry

233
00:21:52,687 --> 00:21:55,390
I got out on the way

234
00:21:55,609 --> 00:21:56,952
Because you are popular

235
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,265
It ’s hard because you ’re a popular person.

236
00:22:00,773 --> 00:22:06,491
Recently I'm busy even on holidays

237
00:22:07,866 --> 00:22:11,671
She will become an increasingly popular geisha

238
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:12,921
Really?

239
00:22:13,413 --> 00:22:14,835
I'll introduce you

240
00:22:15,218 --> 00:22:16,851
Pleased to meet you

241
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,460
Stop it

242
00:22:43,257 --> 00:22:45,616
You're not sexy enough for me.

243
00:22:46,577 --> 00:22:48,546
Don't spit out rough words

244
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:52,062
I don't care.
Soldiers are not here

245
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,179
Don't be so proud

246
00:22:54,312 --> 00:22:55,421
What?

247
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:01,023
They can't catch me.
I'll give them punishment

248
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,632
If I'm a soldier, it's easy to win a war

249
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:06,179
See?

250
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:18,030
I'm sorry but I have to go

251
00:23:18,374 --> 00:23:19,718
Oh too soon

252
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:23,717
Let's take our time next time.

253
00:23:24,296 --> 00:23:24,866
Really?

254
00:23:25,148 --> 00:23:26,304
Yes for sure

255
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,210
Excuse me

256
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,390
Thank you

257
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:39,476
Don't say bad things about the soldiers in front of her

258
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:40,663
Why?

259
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,788
She is a professional geisha of the head soldier

260
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:45,999
Her husband?

261
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:49,804
No, but She has something to do with them

262
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,023
What are you doing, Motokawa!

263
00:26:16,913 --> 00:26:18,773
This is the time bomb he used

264
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:24,023
He hid this in the attic of his hideout.

265
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,937
I failed to catch him.

266
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,726
Did you find out about this bomb?

267
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:33,796
We will experiment with explosive power soon

268
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:35,796
First of all

269
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:38,663
About this

270
00:26:39,468 --> 00:26:42,499
This is pretending to be here and actually it works

271
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:48,460
Here the two substances are mixed

272
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:52,179
This pours sulfuric acid through the spout

273
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:58,687
So connect the two together

274
00:26:59,343 --> 00:27:03,913
Then sulfuric acid will move here

275
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,077
This bomb will now explode

276
00:27:07,804 --> 00:27:13,171
Therefore Explosion time can be adjusted by the thickness of this copper plate

277
00:27:14,718 --> 00:27:22,952
We experimented with different copper plate thicknesses

278
00:27:25,109 --> 00:27:26,530
We’re ready for the experiment

279
00:27:26,765 --> 00:27:27,820
I'm going now

280
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,015
Fire!

281
00:27:46,296 --> 00:27:47,499
It ’s a tremendous destructive power.

282
00:27:48,507 --> 00:27:51,890
It's a pity that he made him self-destruct

283
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:52,725
Stop it

284
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,195
Hey you

285
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,710
You made such a mistake because you tried to take credit for yourself

286
00:28:05,148 --> 00:28:09,968
I don't know what kind of education you got at Nakano School but what can you do?

287
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,163
You're gonna be sorry.

288
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:21,749
We still have a clue to a woman named Umeka

289
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,976
We have no choice but to investigate her

290
00:28:25,491 --> 00:28:29,218
First, get the evidence firmly

291
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:30,976
Step by step

292
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,452
Let's find out about her anyway

293
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,187
Follow her and grab the evidence

294
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,023
Shiina-san

295
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:45,827
This is a telegram to you

296
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,109
Thank you

297
00:29:02,905 --> 00:29:09,413
The telegram was a report from Nakano school about Umeka

298
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:16,023
She was born in Niigata, and moved around

299
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:20,726
I got all the information about her

300
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:27,413
She and her right arm have tattoos

301
00:29:27,788 --> 00:29:34,335
This is the name of her childhood friend

302
00:29:35,351 --> 00:29:36,632
I see

303
00:29:38,538 --> 00:29:42,984
It seems that your mother is hospitalized

304
00:29:45,132 --> 00:29:46,218
In Aichi

305
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:50,023
From here you can go overnight

306
00:29:50,523 --> 00:29:51,788
You should visit her

307
00:29:52,382 --> 00:29:57,898
I understand your feelings, but I have something to do

308
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:05,874
Where did you born?

309
00:30:06,452 --> 00:30:07,507
I was born in Niigata

310
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:13,648
So your skin is so clear

311
00:30:14,093 --> 00:30:15,179
Thanks

312
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:18,249
You don't have a Niigata dialect

313
00:30:18,601 --> 00:30:21,421
I speak Kansai dialect now

314
00:30:21,601 --> 00:30:24,421
I have lived in Kansai for a long time

315
00:30:25,913 --> 00:30:27,015
You've had a hard time

316
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:29,062
Yes really

317
00:30:29,624 --> 00:30:34,296
I haven't had a family since I was a kid

318
00:30:35,132 --> 00:30:35,960
I see

319
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:39,398
You will surely have a future

320
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,702
You think so?

321
00:30:43,226 --> 00:30:44,116
Shall I do Palmistry?

322
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:45,695
Do you know?

323
00:30:46,054 --> 00:30:47,695
I'm a palmist

324
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:48,960
You are kidding

325
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:51,749
You are the chief engineer of the Army, right?

326
00:30:53,343 --> 00:30:55,616
Let me see your palm.
That's my hobby

327
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:07,835
She didn't have an callous for a shamisen in her hand.

328
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,749
How's my hand?

329
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:14,015
How can I say

330
00:31:15,734 --> 00:31:17,124
No!

331
00:31:17,694 --> 00:31:20,483
Sorry, I was just excited

332
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:22,218
No way

333
00:31:23,077 --> 00:31:26,413
You have a tattoo

334
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:29,819
Who's man's name?

335
00:31:30,531 --> 00:31:32,070
He died in the war

336
00:31:33,616 --> 00:31:34,515
Really?

337
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:37,906
I'm sorry

338
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:44,156
He was my childhood friend and we were orphans

339
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:51,648
Who received his remains?

340
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:54,007
Eh?

341
00:31:54,656 --> 00:31:55,241
You?

342
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,913
No, I was in Otsu

343
00:31:59,273 --> 00:32:02,202
But why you ask me that?

344
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,827
If you received his remains, because you are like his wife.

345
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:10,757
You're like a widow.

346
00:32:10,952 --> 00:32:12,991
You are kidding

347
00:32:13,546 --> 00:32:15,874
I'm just a Geisha girl

348
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:18,179
Don't worry

349
00:32:21,601 --> 00:32:26,609
Next day. I visited Sugimoto at Akashiya inn

350
00:32:27,421 --> 00:32:29,343
Umeka lives there

351
00:32:29,937 --> 00:32:33,491
It's a best place to check her

352
00:32:35,296 --> 00:32:36,148
She was in Otsu?

353
00:32:38,101 --> 00:32:43,296
According to Kubota,
She moved Kanazawa to somewhere

354
00:32:45,585 --> 00:32:47,781
She moved to Otsu maybe

355
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:52,156
I should ask Kubota to investigate it

356
00:32:52,671 --> 00:32:53,968
I'll go to Otsu

357
00:32:54,593 --> 00:32:59,038
You ask Kubota to investigate the guy who died in the war

358
00:33:00,031 --> 00:33:01,851
I'll follow Umeka

359
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:05,577
How do you like living here?

360
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,429
Not bad, but a little boring

361
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,234
I'll contact you when I'm back from Otsu

362
00:33:30,601 --> 00:33:31,484
Take care

363
00:34:15,687 --> 00:34:20,007
There wasn't much information about her

364
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,077
Finally...

365
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:27,265
Oh Umeka works as a Geisha in Kobe

366
00:34:28,796 --> 00:34:29,765
What's wrong?

367
00:34:30,765 --> 00:34:33,991
I thought she was already married

368
00:34:34,812 --> 00:34:35,765
married?

369
00:34:36,812 --> 00:34:44,241
She had a childhood friend, Takashi Saito, who died in the war.

370
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,882
She got married to another person

371
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:48,929
Yes

372
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:53,648
I got a call from someone who was with Mr. Saito on the battlefield

373
00:34:54,155 --> 00:34:58,937
After that, Umeka suddenly left home.

374
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:04,382
It's been about a month since then.

375
00:35:04,913 --> 00:35:07,195
She said she would get married suddenly

376
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:09,156
So Umeka backed?

377
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:12,491
No. she didn't

378
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:19,156
Her marriage partner is a customer when she was in Kanazawa

379
00:35:20,999 --> 00:35:24,366
She told me not to ask her detailed words.

380
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:29,249
But she politely greeted me

381
00:35:29,999 --> 00:35:34,179
We all said she looked happy.

382
00:35:34,976 --> 00:35:36,171
When was it?

383
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:40,960
It was about 3 months before I started this business

384
00:35:41,452 --> 00:35:43,179
It was around August last year

385
00:36:43,726 --> 00:36:45,843
Excuse me.
I'm Sakai from the design department

386
00:36:45,999 --> 00:36:46,593
Please

387
00:36:46,851 --> 00:36:48,179
It's too late

388
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:51,687
I forgot to lock

389
00:36:52,952 --> 00:36:53,811
I am responsible

390
00:36:53,968 --> 00:36:55,101
That's too bad

391
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:56,859
Please come in

392
00:36:57,538 --> 00:36:58,195
Sorry

393
00:37:08,577 --> 00:37:09,046
Hey

394
00:37:19,117 --> 00:37:19,687
Wait

395
00:38:32,773 --> 00:38:33,202
Go

396
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,968
Did you get the documents?

397
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:31,109
Yes

398
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,687
I immediately contacted my home country after hearing from Mr. Sasaki.

399
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:42,147
It was bad not to tell you about Tadashi Saito in China

400
00:40:43,843 --> 00:40:45,140
But it can't helped

401
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:51,569
He is still alive since he became our POW

402
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,242
I want to ask you about a guy called Shiina

403
00:40:56,398 --> 00:41:01,882
He is a classmate of Mr. Sasaki's college days and now works at the Towa Institute of Economic Research.

404
00:41:03,906 --> 00:41:08,648
But according to him, he is always out of the Institute

405
00:41:10,038 --> 00:41:12,023
He may be a detective

406
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:19,156
The Army's been doing a lot of investigating since that ship exploded.

407
00:41:20,351 --> 00:41:23,648
So be careful about him

408
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,296
I know

409
00:41:26,257 --> 00:41:30,367
I can't reveal myself to him until the mission is over.

410
00:41:31,031 --> 00:41:33,124
Ok, so let's move on the test

411
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:39,867
This material was also provided by Tadashi Saito, so there is no doubt that it is certain.

412
00:41:41,906 --> 00:41:46,538
Have you taken this test in your country?

413
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:47,726
No

414
00:41:48,421 --> 00:41:50,546
This is a truth serum.

415
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:54,202
Hitting this will put you in a hypnotic state

416
00:41:55,374 --> 00:41:59,171
No matter how much you put up with it, you won't lie

417
00:42:00,515 --> 00:42:05,687
If you pass this test, you can be completely Umeka

418
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:07,695
OK?

419
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:24,827
Umeka, your lover is

420
00:42:26,156 --> 00:42:27,492
Tadashi Saito

421
00:42:29,148 --> 00:42:30,398
He died last year

422
00:42:31,984 --> 00:42:33,382
Where is his spirit?

423
00:42:35,765 --> 00:42:38,054
The village mayor in the countryside accepted

424
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,577
This is a picture of  Umeka that I got in Otsu

425
00:43:06,249 --> 00:43:08,351
Please take a look at it

426
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:15,827
If this is a fake, they look very similar.

427
00:43:18,968 --> 00:43:21,617
Shall someone read from Otsu and listen to the story?

428
00:43:23,327 --> 00:43:24,570
I was thinking about that

429
00:43:26,202 --> 00:43:28,234
I got new information from Nakano school

430
00:43:29,577 --> 00:43:32,124
Maybe that's proof

431
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:40,663
Why did your boyfriend's mother die?

432
00:43:40,976 --> 00:43:46,132
I was working in Tsuruga at that time

433
00:43:46,812 --> 00:43:48,702
I went to visit her

434
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:52,179
Did she transfuse?

435
00:43:52,773 --> 00:43:54,687
She did a lot

436
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:56,992
Her blood type was O

437
00:43:57,523 --> 00:43:59,617
It seems that it was the least blood type

438
00:44:00,288 --> 00:44:03,437
I took turns with Mr. Tadashi and gave blood

439
00:44:04,374 --> 00:44:07,507
So your blood type is O type, isn't it?

440
00:44:08,031 --> 00:44:08,867
Yes

441
00:44:10,421 --> 00:44:11,382
Give me a glass

442
00:44:36,015 --> 00:44:37,851
Send this by express delivery

443
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,898
How about the document?

444
00:44:53,757 --> 00:44:57,015
He is the man caught at Yokohama Port today

445
00:44:58,085 --> 00:45:03,640
This is a picture of a new battleship in Kobe Port.

446
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,311
The factory in Kobe is under our control

447
00:45:07,889 --> 00:45:12,241
We caught a spy who stole this photo

448
00:45:12,523 --> 00:45:14,476
Let us form a research team

449
00:45:15,562 --> 00:45:18,538
Use local people for private research.

450
00:45:57,601 --> 00:45:58,288
I'm home

451
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:05,679
Takashi looks like a spy

452
00:46:06,413 --> 00:46:08,570
What? Sakai?

453
00:46:14,484 --> 00:46:15,781
Sorry I made you wait

454
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:17,773
I'm her husband, Sasaki

455
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:23,218
What kind of relationship do you have with Mr. Sakai?

456
00:46:23,343 --> 00:46:24,148
Well...

457
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:29,663
I was introduced to him by the design manager of a Japanese ship

458
00:46:30,507 --> 00:46:33,367
I come home late for work.

459
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:34,984
I asked him to guard the house

460
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,968
Because he had a good reputation

461
00:46:38,257 --> 00:46:39,046
I see

462
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:43,421
I've heard from my wife

463
00:46:44,445 --> 00:46:45,749
I think something is wrong

464
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:49,132
We have proof

465
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,484
He is denying

466
00:46:53,304 --> 00:46:55,656
There is also testimony that he was in and out in the middle of the night

467
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,585
in the middle of the night?

468
00:46:58,632 --> 00:46:59,468
When was it?

469
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:02,007
Do you have any idea?

470
00:47:02,859 --> 00:47:04,226
Nothing

471
00:47:04,251 --> 00:47:06,952
If you don't be honest, you will be suspected

472
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,484
Actually it was the other night

473
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:19,288
Tell me what you know,Sakai

474
00:47:20,632 --> 00:47:22,257
I'm not spy

475
00:47:22,359 --> 00:47:23,257
Don't pretend you don't know

476
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:25,038
I hit you

477
00:47:34,249 --> 00:47:36,843
I didn't do anything.

478
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,304
I stole the drawing on my own

479
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:44,031
The drawing was written by me

480
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:45,109
Don't make excuses

481
00:47:45,134 --> 00:47:45,960
Trust me

482
00:47:46,304 --> 00:47:48,460
Please trust me

483
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,656
I'll bring someone

484
00:47:52,093 --> 00:47:53,632
Call him

485
00:48:00,851 --> 00:48:02,585
Oh,Sasaki-san

486
00:48:04,367 --> 00:48:05,749
Help me

487
00:48:06,437 --> 00:48:07,117
Sakai-kun

488
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:09,874
You did something bad

489
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:16,046
I should have held you back

490
00:48:17,819 --> 00:48:19,944
That night I went to the bathroom around 11:30

491
00:48:20,906 --> 00:48:22,187
And I looked through the window

492
00:48:22,827 --> 00:48:25,859
You went out

493
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,585
I thought you went for a walk for a change

494
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:33,867
No way

495
00:48:34,171 --> 00:48:39,890
You gave me sleeping pills that night

496
00:48:40,484 --> 00:48:41,585
Don't make a lie

497
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:43,546
I'm in trouble

498
00:50:16,374 --> 00:50:18,171
What were you doing?

499
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:19,327
Let me go!

500
00:50:21,038 --> 00:50:21,820
Let me go!

501
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:32,109
Hi Shiina-san

502
00:50:33,109 --> 00:50:34,609
Thanks for your work

503
00:50:34,984 --> 00:50:37,390
Thanks to you, the damage was kept to a minimum

504
00:50:38,906 --> 00:50:42,249
Mr. Sasaki seems to have been on good terms with the upper class.

505
00:50:42,274 --> 00:50:45,921
If We couldn't catch him, I think the damage would have been great

506
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:48,007
Did he confess?

507
00:50:48,468 --> 00:50:53,765
He doesn't confess easily

508
00:50:55,171 --> 00:50:57,499
I want to ask you something

509
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:04,109
I want you to convince him because he is your college friend

510
00:51:04,968 --> 00:51:06,976
If he cooperates with us

511
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:09,335
We're not going to execute him.

512
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,781
What do you think of this?

513
00:51:14,953 --> 00:51:20,335
Western countries are desperately trying to protect the colonized nations

514
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:25,632
Soviet and China are the enemies of the world

515
00:51:27,648 --> 00:51:32,546
It is a shame for the Japanese to give them national secrets

516
00:51:34,796 --> 00:51:35,960
I'm not being paid off.

517
00:51:37,031 --> 00:51:39,085
What did you say?

518
00:51:44,234 --> 00:51:47,179
I'm here on Captain Yamaoka's orders.

519
00:51:48,226 --> 00:51:52,288
I got permission to talk with him

520
00:51:52,718 --> 00:51:53,570
You and he only?

521
00:51:56,468 --> 00:52:00,109
You're not trying to get him away?

522
00:52:06,828 --> 00:52:08,835
I'm in the next room so Contact me when you're done

523
00:52:34,335 --> 00:52:35,460
When I met you the other day

524
00:52:36,921 --> 00:52:37,984
I falsified my identity

525
00:52:41,413 --> 00:52:42,390
same with me

526
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:48,796
I never thought my college friends would have this kind of relationship.

527
00:52:52,437 --> 00:52:53,617
Listen to me

528
00:52:55,585 --> 00:52:57,609
You don't want to die, right?

529
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:02,328
It might be so

530
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:05,390
I want to know your background

531
00:53:06,335 --> 00:53:08,203
Then you'll be fine for life.

532
00:53:08,999 --> 00:53:09,984
What do you think?

533
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:11,695
I decline

534
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:18,265
Are you willing to leave your small child to die?

535
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,288
It's not your business

536
00:53:23,835 --> 00:53:25,281
This is a matter of my belief

537
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,648
I'm talking as your friend

538
00:53:32,273 --> 00:53:34,085
Are you going to change your mind?

539
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:37,023
You should change your mind

540
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:38,898
Why?

541
00:53:44,734 --> 00:53:46,812
I grabbed your proof

542
00:53:54,163 --> 00:53:56,835
Then I'm honored

543
00:53:58,171 --> 00:53:59,765
Let's call that colonel.

544
00:54:00,867 --> 00:54:02,992
Anyway

545
00:54:06,374 --> 00:54:08,015
It's hard to be with you

546
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:35,046
It seems that friendship had no effect on selling countries

547
00:54:48,445 --> 00:54:49,273
Thank you

548
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:52,296
I want to say something to you

549
00:54:54,046 --> 00:54:55,390
Take care of your life

550
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,100
Ensign Shiina.

551
00:55:14,281 --> 00:55:15,179
There is a letter for you

552
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:16,749
Thank you

553
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,867
Finally I got a strong clue

554
00:55:29,007 --> 00:55:32,343
We authenticated the saliva on her cigarette butt.

555
00:55:33,226 --> 00:55:36,710
Umeka had an a-type blood type instead of an O-type

556
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:40,538
She is a fake

557
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:43,062
I'm so upset now

558
00:55:45,788 --> 00:55:47,742
Can you give me a fire?

559
00:56:09,702 --> 00:56:10,570
Sasaki!

560
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:16,007
Sasaki!

561
00:56:25,358 --> 00:56:27,054
He's dead. Put him in the car

562
00:56:35,749 --> 00:56:36,452
I was surprised

563
00:56:38,507 --> 00:56:39,225
Nishida

564
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:43,155
We will be punished at the conference in Tokyo

565
00:56:53,741 --> 00:56:55,280
at the conference in Tokyo

566
00:56:56,522 --> 00:56:59,038
I decided to look forward to the meeting

567
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,405
As I thought

568
00:57:10,374 --> 00:57:13,702
Something important will be said at this meeting.

569
00:57:14,499 --> 00:57:16,827
Umeka knew it

570
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:20,749
She must be active at the night

571
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:32,757
That's fine

572
00:57:39,365 --> 00:57:41,654
We were tired of Sasaki

573
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:42,983
I'm sorry

574
00:57:44,241 --> 00:57:46,913
You don't have to worry so much

575
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:50,085
I will go back to Kobe and work hard

576
00:57:51,577 --> 00:57:52,632
Take a rest

577
00:57:56,936 --> 00:57:57,600
Good night

578
00:59:01,827 --> 00:59:03,515
I've been waiting for you

579
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:06,897
Have you found a new lover?

580
00:59:07,132 --> 00:59:09,327
No way,
I've been so busy

581
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:12,897
So there was no banquet.

582
00:59:12,936 --> 00:59:15,413
I don't care about your boss

583
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,054
I only like you

584
00:59:20,108 --> 00:59:22,733
Didn't you sleep with my boss?

585
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:24,725
I'll get angry

586
00:59:24,757 --> 00:59:27,952
You mist know Your boss is too serious

587
00:59:27,977 --> 00:59:28,710
I see

588
00:59:29,671 --> 00:59:33,725
I was his assistant.
Now I can sleep with you

589
00:59:33,944 --> 00:59:35,850
But it's exciting

590
00:59:36,147 --> 00:59:39,061
I happen to be in Tokyo today

591
00:59:39,515 --> 00:59:41,421
You are also a strange person

592
00:59:42,186 --> 00:59:43,757
Let's have a bath

593
00:59:44,007 --> 00:59:44,663
Sure

594
00:59:54,554 --> 00:59:55,374
Come later

595
01:00:36,038 --> 01:00:37,507
Come now

596
01:00:38,147 --> 01:00:39,569
I'll go soon

597
01:01:44,890 --> 01:01:47,288
Let's try to develop this as soon as possible.

598
01:01:47,671 --> 01:01:50,577
It will take about an hour to start it now

599
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:51,358
Yes

600
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:54,944
Shiina

601
01:01:55,663 --> 01:01:57,897
You go to see your mom

602
01:01:59,054 --> 01:01:59,960
to my Mother?

603
01:02:02,186 --> 01:02:05,835
Your mother seems to be in critical condition

604
01:02:07,288 --> 01:02:08,124
You must see her

605
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,764
Go ahead, don't worry about us.

606
01:02:23,890 --> 01:02:26,538
No, I won't go

607
01:02:27,632 --> 01:02:28,343
Why?

608
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,913
Why you don't go?

609
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:34,100
I'm not Jiro Miyoshi anymore

610
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:46,153
You told me to put my personal feelings aside.

611
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:54,122
Since then, I've been to try to be Jiro Shiina

612
01:02:55,388 --> 01:02:58,177
Then I'm him now

613
01:02:59,935 --> 01:03:01,349
I have no parents

614
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:06,865
Let's move on,Kubota

615
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:09,622
Shall I help you?

616
01:03:45,544 --> 01:03:46,935
How's her?

617
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:50,997
I'm preparing for a blood transfusion, but the person hasn't come yet

618
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:52,997
Please take my blood

619
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:57,333
I'm taking a little too much of your blood

620
01:03:57,358 --> 01:03:59,036
Don't worry about me

621
01:03:59,818 --> 01:04:01,232
I can't let her die

622
01:04:01,693 --> 01:04:02,700
Please do it now

623
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:32,427
You've dropped something

624
01:04:33,427 --> 01:04:34,794
Oh thank you

625
01:05:06,474 --> 01:05:09,872
You believe this is a sneak peek by Umeka?

626
01:05:10,529 --> 01:05:11,443
That's right

627
01:05:12,115 --> 01:05:15,286
Immediately after you took a bath that night

628
01:05:16,083 --> 01:05:17,310
Don't sat bullshit

629
01:05:18,388 --> 01:05:20,990
Are you going to trap me?

630
01:05:21,958 --> 01:05:25,810
I thought of you and brought it directly like this

631
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:32,490
Ok come with me.
I'll bring her too

632
01:05:48,747 --> 01:05:50,068
Did I take this photo?

633
01:05:51,044 --> 01:05:52,091
He said that

634
01:05:54,615 --> 01:05:56,185
What if I take this photo?

635
01:05:57,302 --> 01:05:59,021
You can earn money if you sell this to a spy

636
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:01,857
It might be so

637
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:04,411
But, Nishida-san

638
01:06:04,983 --> 01:06:11,827
Do you think I'm the one who does this for money?

639
01:06:14,507 --> 01:06:15,515
I'm sad

640
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:20,890
I never do such a terrible thing

641
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,054
That's too bad

642
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:24,288
That's too bad

643
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:27,780
You believe what he says

644
01:06:32,436 --> 01:06:33,858
Hey, Shiina

645
01:06:34,725 --> 01:06:36,327
This is the trap you made

646
01:06:37,116 --> 01:06:38,202
Why did you say that?

647
01:06:38,421 --> 01:06:39,405
I've heard that

648
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:43,124
Nakano School has a sneaky education

649
01:06:44,022 --> 01:06:45,858
You used very terrible means

650
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:48,194
Then I'll ask her

651
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:50,085
Umeka

652
01:06:51,327 --> 01:06:52,890
You are fake Umeka

653
01:06:54,554 --> 01:06:59,679
You are a fake of the real Umeka from Otsu.

654
01:07:00,538 --> 01:07:02,038
You and she have different blood types

655
01:07:02,905 --> 01:07:03,413
Umeka

656
01:07:04,405 --> 01:07:08,975
You guys killed the real Umeka in Otsu

657
01:07:10,265 --> 01:07:13,616
Why you wanted to be her?

658
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:18,296
You're still telling me you don't know these pictures?

659
01:07:23,921 --> 01:07:24,491
Tell me

660
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:27,757
Say something

661
01:07:36,944 --> 01:07:37,960
I have nothing to say

662
01:07:39,577 --> 01:07:42,702
You admit that you are a traitor?

663
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:48,147
Yes, if I'm Japanese

664
01:07:49,241 --> 01:07:50,882
But I'm not Japanese

665
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,640
I am a patriot who likes my country

666
01:07:55,796 --> 01:07:59,749
I am one of the warriors who will protect my country from Japanese aggression.

667
01:08:01,632 --> 01:08:05,241
Then you stole the information about that new bomb?

668
01:08:09,905 --> 01:08:11,390
You've been fooling me all the time

669
01:08:13,905 --> 01:08:16,413
Humans without beliefs are always stupid

670
01:08:17,491 --> 01:08:19,804
A human without a belief in protecting freedom and peace

671
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:01,944
What? what happened?

672
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:05,749
So Umeka's true identity has been exposed.

673
01:09:06,921 --> 01:09:08,460
There was something wrong

674
01:09:09,210 --> 01:09:13,647
I don't think the Japanese will find her true identity

675
01:09:14,163 --> 01:09:18,202
But anyway I'll contact her

676
01:09:28,046 --> 01:09:34,124
We are investigating this church for violating the National Security Act

677
01:09:34,827 --> 01:09:37,108
This is a holy church.

678
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,334
You can do whatever you want

679
01:09:39,913 --> 01:09:43,093
But what if there is no evidence?

680
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,780
In that case I will take responsibility

681
01:09:46,030 --> 01:09:47,702
You'll take responsibility?

682
01:09:47,913 --> 01:09:54,218
God does not forgive all mistakes

683
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:55,968
Go ahead!

684
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:57,569
Ready!

685
01:10:43,655 --> 01:10:44,452
Look at that!

686
01:10:51,749 --> 01:10:52,444
What happened?

687
01:10:52,469 --> 01:10:53,460
Nothing happened

688
01:10:54,882 --> 01:10:59,421
You have violated the sacred church,Yamaoka-san

689
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:05,124
I'll protest the Japanese government

690
01:11:05,491 --> 01:11:06,468
Is that OK?

691
01:11:28,483 --> 01:11:33,764
I get it.
I also take responsibility in the worst case

692
01:11:35,803 --> 01:11:39,585
I will follow your response.

693
01:11:40,952 --> 01:11:41,538
Go back!

694
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:44,702
Wait!

695
01:12:10,749 --> 01:12:11,928
Can you pass me the key?

696
01:12:12,421 --> 01:12:13,397
Key?

697
01:12:13,655 --> 01:12:16,030
I don't have it.
I've lost it

698
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:44,796
What's this?

699
01:12:50,999 --> 01:12:53,718
God does not allow suicide

700
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:11,162
Catch that dog!

701
01:13:25,069 --> 01:13:27,007
Japan Shipbuilding Kobe Factory

702
01:13:27,678 --> 01:13:28,710
Completed proportion

703
01:13:29,561 --> 01:13:31,835
Set in 5 pm

704
01:13:49,843 --> 01:13:53,327
A time bomb is set in the center of this factory

705
01:13:53,975 --> 01:13:55,522
The range is around here

706
01:13:55,850 --> 01:13:57,444
Citizens have already evacuated

707
01:13:57,991 --> 01:14:00,358
Explosion time is 5 pm

708
01:14:00,530 --> 01:14:03,678
Just in case,
Complete the mission by 4:50 pm

709
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:05,593
So there is 30 minutes left

710
01:14:05,811 --> 01:14:06,616
Start the mission

711
01:14:06,819 --> 01:14:07,585
Yes

712
01:14:52,647 --> 01:14:54,413
Call off the search.

713
01:14:54,678 --> 01:14:57,585
Evacuate the area now.

714
01:14:59,921 --> 01:15:00,623
Call off the search.

715
01:15:00,648 --> 01:15:01,162
Hey!

716
01:15:01,210 --> 01:15:03,115
Evacuate the area now.

717
01:15:03,444 --> 01:15:04,764
Evacuate the area now.

718
01:15:06,358 --> 01:15:07,382
Come on, Everyone

719
01:15:19,272 --> 01:15:20,569
Everyone is here?

720
01:15:23,022 --> 01:15:24,155
Isn't Shiina still back?

721
01:15:24,264 --> 01:15:24,569
No

722
01:15:25,116 --> 01:15:25,725
What?

723
01:15:33,569 --> 01:15:37,842
Shiina-san, it ’s the time of the explosion. Please come back soon.

724
01:15:38,022 --> 01:15:39,030
Come back!

725
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:47,592
Mr. Shiina,Come back soon

726
01:17:15,655 --> 01:17:18,077
He faked the antenna into a bomb.

727
01:17:18,342 --> 01:17:23,038
This criminal plan by a spy ring

728
01:17:24,233 --> 01:17:31,217
All were arrested because the names of the spy officials were written on the radio.

729
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,608
The mission under the Cloud No. 1 order is over

730
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:44,241
I was ordered to appear at the General Staff

731
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:48,663
Kusanami Lieutenant Colonel

732
01:17:49,835 --> 01:17:50,835
Shiina

733
01:17:54,311 --> 01:17:59,631
Thanks to you, Nakano School's reputation has risen.

734
01:18:02,217 --> 01:18:03,608
I got a telegram from Kubota

735
01:18:04,655 --> 01:18:09,272
You took care of my mother on my behalf

736
01:18:10,694 --> 01:18:11,796
Thank you very much

737
01:18:12,796 --> 01:18:13,506
Not at all

738
01:18:20,366 --> 01:18:21,108
But

739
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:24,928
Mother is important to humans

740
01:18:26,358 --> 01:18:29,272
I said no personal feelings are necessary for a spy.

741
01:18:29,967 --> 01:18:32,022
You accomplished it

742
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:36,030
Thank you,Shiina

743
01:18:42,702 --> 01:18:44,123
Are you going to the General Staff?

744
01:18:44,374 --> 01:18:44,991
Yes

745
01:18:47,842 --> 01:18:50,569
I'll give you only one piece of information

746
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,483
You are promoted to lieutenant

747
01:18:53,428 --> 01:18:57,108
I'd like to know more about my assignment.

748
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,553
Please tell me

749
01:18:59,374 --> 01:19:00,100
I can't tell

750
01:19:00,647 --> 01:19:01,999
No personal feelings are necessary for a spy.

751
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:07,702
Shiina

752
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:10,038
As I told you before

753
01:19:10,866 --> 01:19:15,975
Wherever you go, take care of your own life.

754
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:19,694
Keep up the good work and stay alive.

755
01:19:20,741 --> 01:19:21,381
See you

756
01:19:22,327 --> 01:19:22,881
Yes

757
01:19:23,928 --> 01:19:24,850
I'm leaving

758
01:20:16,483 --> 01:20:22,959
The end

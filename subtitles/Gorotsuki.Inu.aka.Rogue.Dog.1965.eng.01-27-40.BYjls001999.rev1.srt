Gorotsuki Inu / Rogue Dog
(Inu/Dog Series #3)

3
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:19,309
I'm going on another trip.

4
00:01:20,895 --> 00:01:23,285
I'm thinking of getting a wife and settling down

5
00:01:24,098 --> 00:01:25,879
But I'm good guy and good rider

6
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:30,020
I want to play some more

7
00:01:31,387 --> 00:01:32,481
It can't be helped

8
00:01:56,453 --> 00:01:57,976
She's a good woman

9
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,589
Shit

10
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,106
It can't be helped

11
00:02:19,453 --> 00:02:20,413
Can you help me to ride?

12
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:21,742
Go ahead

13
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:46,764
Why am I so popular with women?

14
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:51,548
It can't be helped.
I'm good guy

15
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:57,647
That's what I thought.
This is great

16
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:05,075
you have a fake

17
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:10,575
I'm coming to see you tonight

18
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,807
I'm Fukuda from the North Kobe group.

19
00:05:28,143 --> 00:05:31,534
Thank you for your help

20
00:05:32,674 --> 00:05:36,260
It seems like you guys are worried about something.

21
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:42,752
That's right.
Our boss is gone and business in Osaka is currently very poor.

22
00:05:43,268 --> 00:05:47,089
So we came to another place

23
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:50,901
If the police come, you're over

24
00:05:51,081 --> 00:05:53,003
don't worry about it

25
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:56,510
I don't want to get too involved in the issue right now

26
00:05:59,385 --> 00:06:01,628
This is a very interesting pistol bullet.

27
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,987
Who's the hell he is

28
00:06:38,568 --> 00:06:39,732
Here it is

29
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:43,076
This is great meal

30
00:06:43,101 --> 00:06:45,755
That woman ordered this dish.

31
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:47,966
Have a hearty meal.

32
00:06:48,294 --> 00:06:49,099
I see

33
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,521
It's been a long time since I've seen you

34
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,193
Are you Tamako?

35
00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:57,568
I don't know you

36
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,724
My dead wife's name was Tamako.

37
00:07:01,544 --> 00:07:03,912
Looks and is about the same age as you

38
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,831
I miss her

39
00:07:08,237 --> 00:07:10,245
Why she died?

40
00:07:10,643 --> 00:07:12,612
she died in a car accident

41
00:07:12,637 --> 00:07:18,307
she was hit and run.
So I'm searching all over the country for the culprit.

42
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,386
Your dead wife looked like me?

43
00:07:23,956 --> 00:07:24,714
Kind of

44
00:07:25,902 --> 00:07:28,620
There's one thing that's definitely different.

45
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,112
don't say bad things about me

46
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:32,081
Face?

47
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:34,198
No.. it's boobs

48
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:40,261
She's got nice boobs

49
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,996
I've got nice boobs,too

50
00:07:42,021 --> 00:07:43,340
nothing compares to you

51
00:07:43,365 --> 00:07:45,980
Then try to touch mine

52
00:07:46,183 --> 00:07:48,371
Then let me touch yous

53
00:07:50,238 --> 00:07:53,308
You've got nice boobs too

54
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:56,644
They are well balanced

55
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:02,113
When she died of pneumonia, she took my hand and put it to her chest.

56
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:05,715
You just said that she died in a car accident.

57
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,877
Oh shit

58
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,564
Thank you

59
00:08:09,892 --> 00:08:12,299
Don't pick on me

60
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,158
This is what you do when you make fun of someone

61
00:08:17,171 --> 00:08:18,570
I love you

62
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:22,929
Are you sure?

63
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:25,000
I love you

64
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,752
Well, if that's the case... there's only two things I wanna ask

65
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:32,806
Number one, that woman who brought me here... who the hell is she?

66
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,205
She's been here for over a month.
She's a rich widow from Osaka, YOKO MISAWA.

67
00:08:39,713 --> 00:08:40,509
She's staying alone?

68
00:08:40,689 --> 00:08:41,400
Yes

69
00:08:41,673 --> 00:08:43,681
She's a rich widow

70
00:08:44,048 --> 00:08:45,822
Don't play her

71
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:51,338
Don't get jealous.
She might fall in love with you

72
00:08:51,475 --> 00:08:52,546
I'm jealous

73
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,085
Don't fall in love with me

74
00:08:55,616 --> 00:08:58,319
I wanna ask you one more things

75
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,647
Where's the gambling place tonight?

76
00:09:01,147 --> 00:09:02,390
I have no idea

77
00:09:03,327 --> 00:09:06,725
You're too honest

78
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,171
I love that kind of innocence.

79
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:12,538
You think so?

80
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:14,444
Ok I'll tell you

81
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:17,210
It's a place called Kura, which is located in a separate annex.

82
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,546
I see

83
00:09:24,743 --> 00:09:25,485
Han

84
00:09:26,297 --> 00:09:26,985
Cho

85
00:09:27,493 --> 00:09:28,102
Han

86
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,211
Cho

87
00:09:30,485 --> 00:09:32,391
Decide!

88
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:33,391
Cho

89
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:34,547
Ok

90
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,063
Ready?

91
00:09:38,628 --> 00:09:39,300
Han

92
00:09:49,868 --> 00:09:51,344
do you continue?

93
00:09:56,071 --> 00:09:56,634
Han

94
00:09:56,899 --> 00:09:58,704
Bid please

95
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,374
What's wrong?

96
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:07,889
You cheated on me

97
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,241
I’m very angry with you

98
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,155
I'll play with you later

99
00:10:16,671 --> 00:10:17,233
Really?

100
00:10:17,258 --> 00:10:17,780
Yes

101
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:18,944
I'll wait

102
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,444
I'll wait

103
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:32,350
You're here

104
00:10:34,404 --> 00:10:36,342
thank you for waiting for me

105
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,623
You look so nice

106
00:10:41,334 --> 00:10:44,506
I want to hide here tonight.

107
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,006
I don't know if I'm bothering you.

108
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:51,693
You rented this room for me.

109
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:57,015
If you want to hide, I've got the perfect body to do it.

110
00:10:57,273 --> 00:10:59,336
I'm so glad you did.
I'm counting on you.

111
00:11:02,441 --> 00:11:04,066
you're quick to hide

112
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:09,082
I hear you're a rich widow.

113
00:11:09,988 --> 00:11:10,746
Yoko Mita

114
00:11:11,691 --> 00:11:13,925
Kamoi,How do you know my name?

115
00:11:14,644 --> 00:11:15,550
I asked maid

116
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:18,910
How do you know my name?

117
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:21,496
I checked in under a false name

118
00:11:22,707 --> 00:11:25,183
You're Daisuke Kamoi for sure

119
00:11:25,964 --> 00:11:27,011
you didn't know?

120
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,628
You cheated me

121
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:33,832
your age and style,
I heard you ran away to KISHU.

122
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:35,743
Who told you?

123
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,118
Even police does not know

124
00:11:38,571 --> 00:11:42,524
You disappeared from Osaka

125
00:11:45,076 --> 00:11:46,810
Are you related to Osaka?

126
00:11:47,857 --> 00:11:48,942
Are you a member of yakuza?

127
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:49,396
No

128
00:11:50,865 --> 00:11:55,568
I didn't know.
I didn't even know MISAWA was murdered.

129
00:11:56,513 --> 00:12:00,435
I didn't know he was a gangster... and that he owed money to them.

130
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,122
They killed your husband.

131
00:12:04,904 --> 00:12:07,809
What's your business?
Money lender?

132
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:12,169
He had a legitimate financial business in Kitahama.

133
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:15,826
He didn't know that he was lending money to a gangster.

134
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:20,013
We couldn’t collect the money in the usual way.

135
00:12:20,747 --> 00:12:24,388
We hired another collection specialist.

136
00:12:25,318 --> 00:12:27,568
Then the problem got bigger.

137
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:32,502
I get it

138
00:12:33,494 --> 00:12:35,791
But dead people don't come back to life

139
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:39,197
He's probably having an affair in heaven right now.

140
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,197
You're such a cold person

141
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,166
that's one of my charms

142
00:12:43,236 --> 00:12:46,486
Please... strike at my master's enemies.

143
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:51,121
No, I'll be your master's enemy

144
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,434
Hold on

145
00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:56,496
I can't stop once I run

146
00:12:57,887 --> 00:13:02,754
My heart's racing, and yours, too.
Let's cool it down a bit before we talk.

147
00:13:18,835 --> 00:13:20,335
He's late

148
00:13:26,593 --> 00:13:27,968
What's he doing?

149
00:13:35,953 --> 00:13:39,211
I'm tired after hitting anything,

150
00:13:43,643 --> 00:13:48,268
There's a bar called SUMIRE in Shinsekai. The office of the 16 groups is on the second floor of a bar in Shinsekai

151
00:13:49,337 --> 00:13:55,743
They commit various intelligent crimes

152
00:13:56,657 --> 00:14:00,930
There are three executives,Inatori,henmi,Kawakami

153
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:06,719
You want me to kill them?

154
00:14:07,204 --> 00:14:08,969
Or they'll kill me.

155
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:12,688
They'll kill me the same way they killed my husband.

156
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:19,079
I'd go to the police.
They won't listen to me if I tell them I financed the gang.

157
00:14:21,006 --> 00:14:23,576
Inatori,henmi,Kawakami

158
00:14:24,334 --> 00:14:27,076
Yeah, I'm starving.

159
00:14:28,006 --> 00:14:29,107
I'm serious.

160
00:14:29,132 --> 00:14:31,599
I'm serious, too, and I'm serious about my desires.

161
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:34,857
Leave it to me

162
00:14:35,537 --> 00:14:37,287
are you kidding me?

163
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:39,834
I'm not,wife

164
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:43,521
wife?

165
00:14:43,732 --> 00:14:45,615
Trust me

166
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:48,045
It can't be helped

167
00:14:53,443 --> 00:14:54,881
wife?

168
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,176
Thanks

169
00:15:32,788 --> 00:15:35,709
You've got nice shoes

170
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,061
feet are important

171
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:41,952
you look like a playboy

172
00:15:42,756 --> 00:15:43,522
How do you know?

173
00:15:44,131 --> 00:15:48,030
You can tell what kind of man he is by looking at his shoes

174
00:15:51,991 --> 00:15:54,343
So I'm playboy?

175
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,741
Your shoes are starting to break down

176
00:15:59,272 --> 00:16:01,507
Don't pick on me

177
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:05,007
Don't get me wrong

178
00:16:05,701 --> 00:16:06,974
I see

179
00:16:07,224 --> 00:16:08,607
Nice joke

180
00:16:10,779 --> 00:16:12,490
pay for the space

181
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,193
What are you doing?

182
00:16:15,631 --> 00:16:17,256
You're kamoi

183
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:18,670
You're back in Osaka

184
00:16:20,951 --> 00:16:22,005
You're popular

185
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:23,834
I can beat them easily

186
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:31,775
Thank you very much

187
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,103
Here's change

188
00:16:33,128 --> 00:16:34,041
Take it

189
00:16:57,649 --> 00:17:01,860
Come to my bar

190
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,520
What's wrong?

191
00:17:20,545 --> 00:17:21,582
Yakitori is gone

192
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,449
Yakitori?

193
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:30,423
Welcome

194
00:17:43,956 --> 00:17:46,956
Why you are chasing me?

195
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:53,337
We are ex Tenchi and Gamo group

196
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,313
You did something to us

197
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:57,267
I see.
Are you on probation?

198
00:17:57,572 --> 00:18:00,337
please work well

199
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:04,087
Our boss was arrested because of you.

200
00:18:04,111 --> 00:18:08,329
Give him some tsukudani.

201
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:09,424
What's the hell?

202
00:18:09,986 --> 00:18:11,127
Come with me

203
00:19:00,228 --> 00:19:02,603
They are chicken

204
00:19:03,681 --> 00:19:06,259
It's not because of you

205
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,642
What?

206
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:12,087
Oh you, It's been ages

207
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:14,040
You look so nice

208
00:19:14,384 --> 00:19:15,673
How's your salary?

209
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,259
So so

210
00:19:18,142 --> 00:19:18,790
I'll treat you a meal

211
00:19:19,009 --> 00:19:19,783
What meal?

212
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,548
Of course, Udon

213
00:19:23,616 --> 00:19:25,679
you love udon

214
00:19:25,991 --> 00:19:27,905
I want to eat steak once in a while

215
00:19:28,405 --> 00:19:30,562
What are you thinking about?

216
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:31,898
Nothing, just women

217
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:33,577
She's nice

218
00:19:34,312 --> 00:19:37,726
I like udon noodles because it's connected to my sense of life.

219
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:39,695
Your sense of life?

220
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:43,546
Tap it, stretch it, make it long and thin
This is my life

221
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:44,124
I see.

222
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,030
And on top of that, it's elusive.

223
00:19:58,169 --> 00:19:58,747
Kamoi

224
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,771
Detective Miyamoto committed suicide

225
00:20:03,997 --> 00:20:05,904
He was killed by a pistol master like you.

226
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:07,052
pistol master?

227
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:10,443
Is he better than I?

228
00:20:10,724 --> 00:20:11,646
It could be

229
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,763
He is Shuji Inatori from 16 group

230
00:20:16,185 --> 00:20:17,146
16 group?

231
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,357
2F at sumire bar?

232
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:20,810
Do you know?

233
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,146
I've heard that name a little bit

234
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,376
Shuji Inatori is missing

235
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,962
will you look for him?

236
00:20:30,493 --> 00:20:32,907
I don't want to work for your salary

237
00:20:33,094 --> 00:20:35,266
you don't pay me

238
00:20:35,453 --> 00:20:37,336
You're right.
I don't pay too

239
00:20:39,235 --> 00:20:43,829
If you were in illegal possession of a gun, I could arrest you.

240
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:47,008
Unfortunately, you don't have one.

241
00:20:52,557 --> 00:20:53,729
What do you order?

242
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:54,807
Hold on

243
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:01,268
If you're in Osaka.
The current Tenjikai and GAMO gang are a pain in the ass.

244
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:09,091
If you'll just take my word for it...
I'll talk to them myself.

245
00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:15,833
I see

246
00:21:16,662 --> 00:21:18,287
 I see you're afraid.

247
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:24,747
You heard there was a gunslinger who is better than you.
That's why you're so pissed off.

248
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:27,802
I know how you feel.

249
00:21:29,138 --> 00:21:33,576
You can't do anything by yourself without a gun.

250
00:21:33,601 --> 00:21:34,412
Hold on

251
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:37,021
I'm better than him

252
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:38,591
It can't be helped

253
00:21:39,607 --> 00:21:42,763
Well, I'd like to meet him.

254
00:21:43,052 --> 00:21:44,575
But you don't have a gun

255
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,193
I'm strong without a pistol

256
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:52,912
I see, give me a soup of Udon

257
00:21:54,602 --> 00:21:57,250
I want to eat that soup

258
00:21:58,524 --> 00:22:02,797
I won't help for you

259
00:22:03,828 --> 00:22:07,305
I want to defeat that Inatori

260
00:22:08,391 --> 00:22:10,227
I want to have a pistol duel with him

261
00:22:10,438 --> 00:22:12,938
I'm looking for a pistol later

262
00:22:13,516 --> 00:22:14,336
Just in case

263
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:15,618
I know

264
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:52,911
Is she madam here?

265
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:56,259
I'm looking forward to it.

266
00:23:05,014 --> 00:23:07,614
mayumi,I just got a call.

267
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,357
Inatori wants to see you.

268
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,316
Mr. Inatori is back in Osaka?

269
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:18,850
Don't listen to him,ok?

270
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:20,087
Henmi

271
00:23:22,182 --> 00:23:24,035
What are you talking with her?

272
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,479
I'll take Mayumi to Inatori.

273
00:23:28,899 --> 00:23:30,812
No, I'll take her

274
00:23:31,206 --> 00:23:33,640
Inatori asked me to take her

275
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:36,723
I won't go

276
00:23:37,511 --> 00:23:40,364
Henmi, you fall in love with her?

277
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:44,356
She’s our business tool

278
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,738
She's not just yours

279
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,437
You just have to stay with him for a while

280
00:23:51,605 --> 00:23:54,271
Hold on, I need to talk with her

281
00:24:04,605 --> 00:24:11,099
If you don't go there, we can't get any share

282
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:17,228
You have to listen to him

283
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,388


284
00:24:21,514 --> 00:24:24,114
Mr. Inatori, using me as a tool.

285
00:24:25,129 --> 00:24:26,282
It can't be helped

286
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:32,125
We need money, then we can use the money

287
00:24:34,655 --> 00:24:36,355
Don't throw me away

288
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:54,045
Let's go,Mayumi

289
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:39,436
Get away

290
00:25:46,468 --> 00:25:47,922
I saw you in the evening

291
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:50,114
I don't know you

292
00:25:50,203 --> 00:25:51,163
Police asked me so

293
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,449
I see, ok I don't know you

294
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:57,281
By the way , wanna have a drink for our sake?

295
00:25:57,894 --> 00:26:00,261
What are you talking about?

296
00:26:00,286 --> 00:26:02,027
Just one drink, ok?

297
00:26:05,219 --> 00:26:06,599
OK let’s go

298
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,477
What's wrong?

299
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:27,594
Don't wanna enter?

300
00:26:28,071 --> 00:26:30,131
This bar is our enemy's

301
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:33,385
16 groups have managed this store since TENCHIKAI and GAMO disbanded.

302
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:34,576
We can't go

303
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:37,509
Don't worry, I'm with you

304
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:41,493
Defeat 16 group then you should manage here

305
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:45,018
Can you help us with your pistol skill?

306
00:26:45,043 --> 00:26:48,090
Of course I'll help you guys

307
00:27:04,614 --> 00:27:05,808
What's the hell?

308
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,312
16 groups's bar is here?

309
00:27:09,512 --> 00:27:13,086
They talked about killing your boss

310
00:27:13,218 --> 00:27:15,071
So I took them to here

311
00:27:16,741 --> 00:27:18,434
You cheated us

312
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:22,901
It's too late to make excuses.

313
00:27:22,926 --> 00:27:23,527
What's the hell?

314
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:26,241
They are our enemy

315
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:31,794
I heard their talking.
They talked badly about you

316
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,706
You cheated us

317
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:35,437
It's too late to make excuses.

318
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
Leave it to you

319
00:27:46,989 --> 00:27:47,742
Who are you?

320
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:52,342
I'm just stranger like nasal mucus

321
00:27:52,717 --> 00:27:55,883
You're not our enemy?

322
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:59,280
No way, I like you

323
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,468
You cheated us

324
00:28:02,195 --> 00:28:03,415
Thanks

325
00:28:07,126 --> 00:28:08,420
What's wrong?

326
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:10,004
Where's mayumi?

327
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:12,077
Still at work.

328
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:14,356
Bros

329
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:53,095
Thanks for your help

330
00:28:55,224 --> 00:28:57,718
I don't like to ingratiate myself.

331
00:28:58,378 --> 00:29:03,686
I have a college degree in economics.

332
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:07,968
Are you good at economic?

333
00:29:08,321 --> 00:29:10,414
Well, I'd be happy to work for you if you let me, but...

334
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:13,616
I'm good at keeping the books.

335
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:17,055
I've been involved with a company that's in violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Law.

336
00:29:17,639 --> 00:29:18,445
Can you do it?

337
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,252
I see  I see that’s alright

338
00:29:20,711 --> 00:29:23,618
I'm good at it

339
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:29,130
I'm going to pull out the core of that apple

340
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:30,911
What?

341
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,286
I also took apple seeds.

342
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:56,094
But Don’t be surprised

343
00:29:56,594 --> 00:30:00,654
I can show you more

344
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:26,388
Which guy is Inatori?

345
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:32,276
What's wrong?

346
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:34,555
He's police's dog

347
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:37,208
Me?
What are you talking about?

348
00:30:37,233 --> 00:30:38,592
I hate polices

349
00:30:38,678 --> 00:30:41,005
Tenchikai told us

350
00:30:41,262 --> 00:30:44,102
I know they are lying

351
00:30:46,381 --> 00:30:49,208
Don't tell a lie.
he's our guest

352
00:30:49,694 --> 00:30:52,348
He's pistol master

353
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:57,180
He told us to help us

354
00:30:57,368 --> 00:31:00,728
Yeah, I'm not police

355
00:31:05,398 --> 00:31:07,258
He's passed out

356
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,878
Get the pistol

357
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:31,629
What's the hell?

358
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:34,482
I feel dizzy

359
00:31:37,347 --> 00:31:38,841
What company?

360
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:41,027
company?
What do you mean?

361
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,072
I am a victim.

362
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:48,182
How about you?

363
00:31:49,186 --> 00:31:50,566
This is my business card

364
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:53,951
Manager, First Sales Section, Kansai Boeki Kaisha, Ltd.

365
00:31:54,155 --> 00:31:55,616
Thanks

366
00:31:55,983 --> 00:32:00,428
I was tricked into coming here by a young woman.

367
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:04,842
I was forced to take sleeping pills and my important documents were stolen.

368
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:06,577
Where the hell am I?

369
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:25,777
Stay down

370
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:30,410
I have a pistol, stay down

371
00:32:31,994 --> 00:32:36,010
I wish I could have a pistol

372
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,260
It can't be helped

373
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:41,244
I'll smoke

374
00:32:50,628 --> 00:32:53,980
I was ordered by the boss.
Now I'm giving you orders.

375
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:58,699
It's your job to kill him.

376
00:32:59,574 --> 00:33:03,644
It's not a good idea to use people to make profit.

377
00:33:04,717 --> 00:33:06,053
What if I kill him?

378
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:09,866
If you kill him, there will be more trade jobs in Kansai.

379
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:12,428
It worth 40 million yen

380
00:33:12,928 --> 00:33:15,350
Use this pistol

381
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:18,944
Police chase Kamoi

382
00:33:19,788 --> 00:33:22,007
Don't worry about you

383
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:27,921
Let's all share the profits of this work.

384
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:32,221
Boss,Inatori, you and me

385
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:37,697
Let's get big money

386
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:44,231
Be sure to kill him, I'm watching you

387
00:33:44,817 --> 00:33:46,301
Bear in mind

388
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,315
If that's the case, I'll do it.

389
00:33:59,778 --> 00:34:02,090
Boss called to release Kamoi

390
00:34:02,364 --> 00:34:02,918
Why?

391
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,996
He's not either police or Gamo,tanchi's guy

392
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:07,989
Why boss know?

393
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:09,458
I should ask him

394
00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:11,247
The boss's orders are absolute

395
00:34:12,028 --> 00:34:12,989
Release him

396
00:34:24,377 --> 00:34:25,268
Release Kamoi

397
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,065
I wanna go home

398
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:33,547
Don't kill me

399
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,214
Give me my pistol

400
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:47,355
Stupid, you should thank to us, you are alive

401
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:48,582
Go

402
00:34:49,933 --> 00:34:52,324
Boss is Inatori?

403
00:34:52,542 --> 00:34:53,925
It's none of your business

404
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:56,276
Give me my pistol

405
00:34:58,566 --> 00:34:59,496
later

406
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:00,551
When?

407
00:35:00,996 --> 00:35:02,957
Tonight

408
00:35:03,652 --> 00:35:05,746
Take him to your house

409
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,496
This is Boss's order

410
00:35:09,504 --> 00:35:10,340
I trust you

411
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,207
What are you going to do with him?

412
00:35:13,309 --> 00:35:15,395
We'll release him later

413
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,967
Hold on, I need my pistol

414
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:28,280
I'll pay you back later

415
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,413
Hold on

416
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:44,077
Are you a police officer?

417
00:35:45,178 --> 00:35:46,210
It's none of your business

418
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,866
Anyway, I know for a fact that you're trying to destroy 16group.

419
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:55,036
Go to this place, I'll give you the pistol

420
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,146
I trust you

421
00:35:58,836 --> 00:35:59,360
Go

422
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:01,782
See you

423
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:14,289
I don't have a pistol, so I feel lonely and feel like I'm going to catch a cold.

424
00:36:15,491 --> 00:36:17,147
I’m looking forward to tonight

425
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:31,552
Too early

426
00:36:33,302 --> 00:36:35,036
Wrong person

427
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:36,888
Come in

428
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:42,891
He'll come back soon

429
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:44,360
Whose house is this?

430
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:48,251
did you come here without knowing?

431
00:36:48,743 --> 00:36:50,298
Here's Shibata's houses

432
00:36:50,821 --> 00:36:53,243
Is this his house?

433
00:36:53,564 --> 00:36:55,118
What do you think about this?

434
00:36:56,071 --> 00:36:57,775
I'd rather play...

435
00:36:58,251 --> 00:37:02,079
That person went shopping with KING in hand.

436
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:03,734
That's ridiculous

437
00:37:04,327 --> 00:37:06,765
Place like this

438
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:10,937
Please don't do such things without permission

439
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,780
Sorry for keeping you waiting

440
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,054
You're a shoe shiner, aren't you?

441
00:37:16,796 --> 00:37:18,327
You're the playboy

442
00:37:18,398 --> 00:37:20,640
I didn't know this was your house

443
00:37:20,827 --> 00:37:22,351
Come in

444
00:37:22,812 --> 00:37:25,163

445
00:37:25,718 --> 00:37:27,265
Sorry for keeping you waiting

I'd rather play...

447
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:33,702
Why did you come here?

448
00:37:33,874 --> 00:37:37,390
A beautiful woman asked me to come here and wait for someone.

449
00:37:38,257 --> 00:37:39,218

450
00:37:39,312 --> 00:37:41,202

00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:51,132

457
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,038

Come here, there's a problem

466
00:38:22,804 --> 00:38:24,133
What's wrong?

467

478

479
00:39:05,299 --> 00:39:08,207

00:41:09,072 --> 00:41:12,064
I missed this

508
00:41:14,985 --> 00:41:16,555
This works fine

509
00:41:17,719 --> 00:41:18,446
Thanks

510
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:25,039
But... leaving your parents' funeral to the neighbors and going home...
This is unforgivable.

511
00:41:26,105 --> 00:41:28,402
He's not your real dad.

512
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,456
but...
you call him Dad.

513
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:32,636
He raised me.

514
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:35,245
You know what they say about a godparent and a foster parent, don't you?

515
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll raise you as your husband

516
00:41:42,354 --> 00:41:45,721
you should get out of that group

517
00:41:46,229 --> 00:41:47,425
You should be careful

518
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:48,893
You don't have to worry about that.

519
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:53,097
Could you represent us at the farewell ceremony?

520
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:53,785
Wait a minute

521
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:54,785
Wait a minute?

522
00:41:54,972 --> 00:41:57,965
I thought you were going to be her husband

523
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:59,262
I was just asked

524
00:41:59,287 --> 00:42:02,114
I hope you are not bad man

525
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,840
Do I look?

526
00:42:04,278 --> 00:42:06,254
Where she's gone?

527
00:42:06,426 --> 00:42:08,356
Get your hands off of me!

528
00:42:08,778 --> 00:42:09,622
I’m sad

529
00:42:09,647 --> 00:42:10,974
What are you doing?

530
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:13,771
I've done. let's leave from Osaka

531
00:42:18,919 --> 00:42:20,028
What's wrong?

532
00:42:22,098 --> 00:42:23,239
Go ahead.

533
00:42:24,362 --> 00:42:28,612
I was ordered by the BOSS to join the MAFUJI-gumi in Hiroshima.

534
00:42:29,706 --> 00:42:30,588
So?

535
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:39,647
I killed kacho with that pistol

536
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:44,663
I thought you didn't kill him and you were going to ask me out and run away.

537
00:42:45,186 --> 00:42:46,999
I'd killed if I didn't kill him

538
00:42:47,789 --> 00:42:50,680
I don't want the share

539
00:42:52,156 --> 00:42:56,555
I wanted to get out from 16 group with you but

540
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:01,318
You don't like?

541
00:43:02,357 --> 00:43:05,232
I killed him, you don't wanna stay with me anymore?

542
00:43:09,406 --> 00:43:10,671
You don't like?

543
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,422
you wanna stay with me ?

544
00:43:37,878 --> 00:43:39,941
Henmi

545
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:41,550
Henmi

546
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,455
Help us

547
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,386
Help us

548
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:49,503
Help us

549
00:43:57,105 --> 00:43:58,019
Fire?

550
00:44:03,893 --> 00:44:05,104
Yakuza's fight?

551
00:44:05,129 --> 00:44:06,104
Which group?

552
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,431
He was killed by pistol

553
00:44:08,456 --> 00:44:09,135
By yappa

554
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,682
He was killed by pistol

555
00:44:09,707 --> 00:44:10,346
By yappa

556
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,057
He was killed by pistol

557
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:11,885
By yappa

558
00:44:11,955 --> 00:44:14,518
Ok let's bid

559
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:20,780
Did you confirm?

560
00:44:21,412 --> 00:44:22,217
What's the hell?

561
00:44:22,874 --> 00:44:23,780
She looks nice

562
00:44:24,507 --> 00:44:26,866
she's already dressed

563
00:44:27,202 --> 00:44:28,507
yes really

564
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:33,188
What are you going to do?

565
00:44:35,727 --> 00:44:36,680
What's wrong?

566
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,781
you are a murder suspect

567
00:44:41,936 --> 00:44:44,350
Don't lose any sleep over it.
I just got here.

568
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:47,608
Ok it's not you

569
00:44:47,702 --> 00:44:49,225
you don't have the pistol

570
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:51,999
you are a really nosy bastard

571
00:44:52,249 --> 00:44:53,147
What's the hell?

572
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:54,678
You're too noisy

573
00:44:55,655 --> 00:44:57,663
I wanna fight with you

574
00:44:58,514 --> 00:44:59,491
Just bring it

575
00:45:00,022 --> 00:45:01,569
Ok come

576
00:45:09,618 --> 00:45:12,610
Look, I'm stronger

577
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:29,473
I've seen this before

578
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:30,654
Yours?

579
00:45:31,381 --> 00:45:32,217
Don't say bullshit

580
00:45:32,873 --> 00:45:35,881
That one came out of some guy's heart today.

581
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:38,562
This guy.

582
00:45:40,664 --> 00:45:41,882
This is Kansai-trader

583
00:45:43,289 --> 00:45:45,437
Where was he killed?

584
00:45:47,203 --> 00:45:49,749
How you know about him?

585
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:56,025
Well.. I haven't seen him

586
00:45:56,221 --> 00:45:59,650
You're lying, you just told me kansai trader

587
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,463
I forgot to tell you

588
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:05,044
 you just told me

589
00:46:05,692 --> 00:46:08,294
That's strange

590
00:46:08,692 --> 00:46:09,708
Oh you told me

591
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:10,528
me?

592
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:14,888
You showed this and told Fukushima trader's guy

593
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:18,317
He was killed

594
00:46:18,974 --> 00:46:20,489
I feel sorry

595
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:24,513
He was floating in the Kizugawa River.
You killed him and throw away?

596
00:46:24,935 --> 00:46:28,145
Stupid, I don't have the pistol

597
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:36,969
The person who shot was died

598
00:46:38,282 --> 00:46:38,946
What?

599
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:44,071
The person was taken away with a woman in the ambulance earlier.

600
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:53,216
boss

601
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:58,584
What do you think was the cause of death of Sales Section Chief Arima?

602
00:47:00,436 --> 00:47:01,108
shot dead

603
00:47:02,756 --> 00:47:03,889
That's bad

604
00:47:04,295 --> 00:47:06,319
And we don't even know who did it.

605
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:09,319
I came to thank you for that.

606
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:12,733
I don't know if I've ever taken care of you before.

607
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:14,279
I don't know.

608
00:47:15,623 --> 00:47:18,709
Isn't the president of the company relieved by the Chief's death?

609
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:26,123
If Chief took those documents to another company, it would turn Kansai Boeki Ltd. upside down.

610
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,344
Mr. Arima was in charge of exporting our new product, Leon, wasn't he?

611
00:47:32,594 --> 00:47:36,305
He planned to dump the product in order to boost exports... at the behest of the president.

612
00:47:37,453 --> 00:47:42,055
On the surface, the company obtained an export certificate from MITI under the guise of exporting at a fair price.

613
00:47:43,047 --> 00:47:46,289
Receive remittances from foreign buyers at the correct amount.

614
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,289
Then?

615
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:53,031
Sneak in a rebate for the lower price.
Foreign currency is obtained in Hong Kong

616
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,457
Paying yen as money to buy foreign currency

617
00:47:57,809 --> 00:47:59,715
That's a violation of the Foreign Exchange Control Law

618
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:04,755
What happens if the police and the industry find out?

619
00:48:06,099 --> 00:48:08,388
What will happen to Kansai Boeki's position?

620
00:48:09,537 --> 00:48:11,443
Do you have any proof of extortion?

621
00:48:19,278 --> 00:48:23,465
Kobe, Hong Kong. Here's the contract: COPY

622
00:48:24,473 --> 00:48:27,043
Signed by the president.
Company seal

623
00:48:28,629 --> 00:48:32,418
The murdered ARIMA was taken while he was with a woman.

624
00:48:32,731 --> 00:48:33,457
woman?

625
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:36,231
Yeah, except for his wife.

626
00:48:38,546 --> 00:48:40,828
So you erased Arima for me?

627
00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:45,593
I want the share.
50/100,000 dollar

628
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,656
That's a small price to pay for this.

629
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:51,374
What if I turn down?

630
00:48:52,898 --> 00:48:54,413
You're not like Arima.

631
00:48:59,449 --> 00:49:01,425
HENMI, the man you counted on, is dead.

632
00:49:03,378 --> 00:49:07,050
Let me help you with your grief.

633
00:49:07,191 --> 00:49:09,003
You're the one who killed HENMI.

634
00:49:09,034 --> 00:49:10,417
What are you talking about?

635
00:49:10,503 --> 00:49:12,824
You kill one, you get more SHARE.

636
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:14,534
Don't say bullshit

637
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:21,231
Oh, come on, I didn't kill Henmi.

638
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:26,590
I was investigated by the police, and I have an alibi.
And now he's been released with an alibi.

639
00:49:27,862 --> 00:49:30,729
It's not true.
You killed HENMI because you wanted SHARE.

640
00:49:31,526 --> 00:49:33,510
Go to the police and ask them.

641
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:38,089
If you don't have HENMI, you might as well be my bitch for the rest of your life.

642
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,039
You have a nice figure

643
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,622
You used my pistol and kill him

644
00:50:30,323 --> 00:50:35,253
You made my pistol dirty

645
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:37,792
I didn't use it.
Henmi used it

646
00:50:37,956 --> 00:50:40,003
you have something to do with it too

647
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:50,295
my pistol is upset

648
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:02,461
When did you get out of the police station?
I took your dad's funeral out with the neighbors.

649
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:07,093
Funeral money was paid with the disposal of household goods and the power of the apartment

650
00:51:09,445 --> 00:51:11,656
There's nowhere for you to go now.

651
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:12,875
Hold on

652
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:17,625
You gave me the pistol that killed someone

653
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:21,086
It's like a father who's daughter is defiled before her wedding.

654
00:51:21,633 --> 00:51:23,164
I don't have anything to do with you anymore

655
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:25,265
Henmi was killed on the orders of her boss.

656
00:51:25,726 --> 00:51:27,719
Boss is Inatori?

657
00:51:28,258 --> 00:51:29,055
No

658
00:51:30,137 --> 00:51:31,817
I don't know what he's like.

659
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:38,137
I like most women.
but I don't like women who made my pistol dirty

660
00:51:39,121 --> 00:51:40,676
I will apology to you for Henmi

661
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:42,785
You are like his wife

662
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:45,238
Please pay back for him

663
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:47,668
Kawakatsu did it for money

664
00:51:48,746 --> 00:51:50,825
do you want to be my wife?

665
00:51:51,403 --> 00:51:53,387
I love you but I can't

666
00:51:57,668 --> 00:51:59,863
Use this and kill him

667
00:52:00,496 --> 00:52:03,902
Henmi used this and Henmi  was killed

668
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:08,270
Because of this, I am suspected by the police.

669
00:52:09,801 --> 00:52:11,996
I owe this PISTOL a debt of gratitude.

670
00:52:16,596 --> 00:52:17,947
See you later.

671
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:37,679
Come in

672
00:52:59,768 --> 00:53:01,104
I didn't kill Henmi

673
00:53:02,213 --> 00:53:03,416
you don't have to hide it

674
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:05,432
you are very reliable

675
00:53:05,783 --> 00:53:10,408
How many times have I told you?
I play pistol, but I don't kill.

676
00:53:11,393 --> 00:53:17,181
I threw everything at you!
You said you'd take out 16 groups.

677
00:53:18,416 --> 00:53:20,729
I'll take care of you, body and soul.

678
00:53:21,924 --> 00:53:27,681
Do you know that the BOSS is above Kawakatsu and Inatori?

679
00:53:27,869 --> 00:53:28,994
Boss?

680
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:33,447
You're kidding me.
You're trying to scare me.

681
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:34,994
I'm serious

682
00:53:35,518 --> 00:53:37,565
They all clearly said BOSS.

683
00:53:38,791 --> 00:53:41,736
Oh, my God, you're going to help me.?

684
00:53:42,463 --> 00:53:43,510
Don't worry

685
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:46,408
I will protect you.

686
00:53:47,315 --> 00:53:49,838
You threw everything at me

687
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:08,611
He ran away

688
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:22,257
I'm surprised you're still alive.

689
00:54:25,186 --> 00:54:28,725
I'm good at defending too

690
00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:31,694
Protect or be attacked, Kurokane no

691
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:36,483
Looks like the Grim Reaper has finally latched on to you.

692
00:54:37,187 --> 00:54:38,366
That's what it looks like.

693
00:54:39,749 --> 00:54:45,218
the guy who hit it from behind.
I've seen him before.

694
00:54:46,272 --> 00:54:47,905
In the bathroom at the SHIRAHAMA

695
00:54:50,663 --> 00:54:54,351
He'll go after you in the bathroom.

696
00:54:54,812 --> 00:54:55,866
He's looking for you.

697
00:54:56,062 --> 00:54:59,421
But you know what?
I never once take my eyes off your skin... or your PISTOL.

698
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:00,968
Oh here's police

699
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:07,827
The bathroom is always a special sight

700
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:21,496
You inquired at the inn where you and the woman were staying.
The man who apparently targeted you was staying in the annex.He calls himself Yasuo Takagi, the broker.

701
00:55:22,926 --> 00:55:24,091
That must be fake name

702
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,020
You think the guy is Inatori?

703
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,200
Can you see that picture of Inatori?

704
00:55:30,348 --> 00:55:32,489
We have his fingerprints, but not a single picture of his face.

705
00:55:33,723 --> 00:55:35,786
he is very cautious

706
00:55:37,598 --> 00:55:41,950
The only one in the police force who knew about it, Detective Miyamoto, was shot and killed.

707
00:55:44,426 --> 00:55:45,380
That's bad

708
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:52,043
He is very intelligent so it is very difficult to control him.

709
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:57,502
You know what he looks like?

710
00:55:58,913 --> 00:55:59,386
Yes

711
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:00,560
 so why don't you cooperate?

712
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:04,390
You came to me, so cooperating us

713
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:07,648
I'm Kimura from Division1

714
00:56:08,512 --> 00:56:10,165
Come to here

715
00:56:10,377 --> 00:56:11,418
Hold om

716
00:56:12,104 --> 00:56:15,031
I don't wanna see any polices, I'm leaving

717
00:56:15,062 --> 00:56:17,607
I treated a meal last day

718
00:56:17,632 --> 00:56:20,261
It was just Udon soup

719
00:56:21,492 --> 00:56:22,072
Kamoi

720
00:56:24,634 --> 00:56:28,307
As a matter of fact, I have chest Disease

721
00:56:31,234 --> 00:56:37,608
I kept it hidden within the police force until I took on Miyamoto's enemies.

722
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:42,184
I'll die soon

723
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,774
I wanna work for Miyamoto

724
00:56:49,597 --> 00:56:51,284
You look sick

725
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:55,128
I see

726
00:56:56,363 --> 00:56:59,883
I have no choice but help you

727
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:01,363
Please

728
00:57:03,305 --> 00:57:04,366
OK I'll help you

729
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:06,451
Take care

730
00:57:07,748 --> 00:57:08,736
Thanks

731
00:57:09,968 --> 00:57:14,126
I'm willing to help you

732
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:15,775
It's Montage

733
00:57:18,774 --> 00:57:24,416
The forehead, the eyes, the nose, the mouth.
The hair, the eyes, the nose, the mouth.

734
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:26,859
I want you to pick out the one that looks like him.

735
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:28,857
I don't know.

736
00:57:29,310 --> 00:57:30,546
You're like a schoolteacher.

737
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:39,158
Oh yeah

738
00:57:41,495 --> 00:57:42,556
Yeah, like the hair.

739
00:57:44,362 --> 00:57:46,580
The eyes are like this one.
Sharp like that.

740
00:58:02,682 --> 00:58:03,937
Is it similar?

741
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:06,601
I don't think so.

742
00:58:13,693 --> 00:58:16,856
That's funny.
The kids will love it.

743
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:18,992
Be serious

744
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:20,040
I am

745
00:58:20,954 --> 00:58:23,772
The lips are so different.
It's more like sharp

746
00:58:27,425 --> 00:58:30,994
eyes are like a woman's,  like a melt-in-your-mouth slit

747
00:58:34,263 --> 00:58:36,154
Oh He’s me

748
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:41,395
It's a familiar face

749
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:45,737
It's me.
I've been looking in the mirror since I was born.

750
00:58:47,097 --> 00:58:50,558
I was dancing in my hotel room when he came after me.

751
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:53,910
This is funny from me.

752
00:58:55,624 --> 00:58:57,508
Can you be serious for a second?

753
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:01,005
Yeah

754
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,951
I'm serious now

755
00:59:18,869 --> 00:59:19,760
Not like him

756
00:59:20,872 --> 00:59:23,217
He should have worn more austere glasses.

757
00:59:26,303 --> 00:59:27,528
Yes he is

758
00:59:29,218 --> 00:59:31,958
I wouldn't say it's conclusive.
It's almost exactly like this.

759
00:59:33,450 --> 00:59:34,044
What do you think?

760
00:59:35,674 --> 00:59:37,353
he looks like Mr. Inatori.

761
00:59:39,549 --> 00:59:42,234
Oh dear, why she's here?

762
00:59:43,055 --> 00:59:44,716
She wants to revenge for Henmi

763
00:59:45,152 --> 00:59:47,061
Why don't you arrest Kawakatsu?

764
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:48,607
He has Alibi

765
00:59:49,618 --> 00:59:56,496
She was a runaway from home and was picked up by HENMI.
He was picked up by HENMI and worked as a liaison for 16 groups while doing business at a bar.

766
00:59:56,970 --> 00:59:59,176
I see.
Let's go home

767
00:59:59,982 --> 01:00:01,018
You go home alone

768
01:00:01,588 --> 01:00:02,854
She has something to do here

769
01:00:02,879 --> 01:00:05,895
Why? I thought you match making with us

770
01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:09,076
You are always being playboy

771
01:00:10,082 --> 01:00:13,258
I'm sometime serous for women

772
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,023
Police

773
01:00:16,948 --> 01:00:20,548
You'll die soon, so you should listen to me sometime

774
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:23,559
My sick...

775
01:00:25,462 --> 01:00:26,201
It's lie

776
01:00:26,486 --> 01:00:27,414
Sorry

777
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:29,359
What?

778
01:00:29,414 --> 01:00:30,644
thanks for your help.

779
01:00:31,657 --> 01:00:33,118
Cut it out

780
01:00:33,269 --> 01:00:35,087
If you get out of line, I'll arrest you.

781
01:00:35,421 --> 01:00:36,524
I've got the arrest file.

782
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:40,047
I'm gonna get you some sort of a rap sheet.

783
01:00:40,959 --> 01:00:42,595
That's not funny.

784
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:45,696
See you then

785
01:00:49,296 --> 01:00:50,933
You're in danger if you work with him.

786
01:00:57,210 --> 01:00:57,840
What's the hell?

787
01:00:59,412 --> 01:01:00,752
You guys must be 16 group

788
01:01:02,164 --> 01:01:03,315
Stay down

789
01:01:04,362 --> 01:01:06,398
You pretend to be police

790
01:01:06,574 --> 01:01:07,289
Get in the car

791
01:01:20,165 --> 01:01:22,504
How did you know I was at Police?

792
01:01:50,509 --> 01:01:51,339
You cheated me

793
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:53,703
What did you talk to police?

794
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,089
I don't give a shit about you.

795
01:01:56,892 --> 01:01:57,607
About me,right?

796
01:01:57,940 --> 01:01:58,467
Wait

797
01:01:59,302 --> 01:02:01,314
There's no benefit for you if you kill me

798
01:02:01,399 --> 01:02:02,975
You're not going to get any more money.

799
01:02:04,528 --> 01:02:05,880
Don't say bullshit

800
01:02:06,837 --> 01:02:09,758
I know Mayumi ask you to kill me

801
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:12,064
Don't say bullshit

802
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:16,905
I hate to kill people even if my lover ask me

803
01:02:17,361 --> 01:02:18,300
Don't say bullshit

804
01:02:19,454 --> 01:02:24,060
We heard Mayumi went to police so we were waiting for her then you came out

805
01:02:25,744 --> 01:02:30,423
You are stupid, Me and her has nothing to do

806
01:02:32,092 --> 01:02:33,158
Put your pistol down

807
01:02:42,581 --> 01:02:44,612
Not bullet, Put your pistol down

808
01:02:45,448 --> 01:02:46,563
Put your pistol down

809
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:48,525
Hold on

810
01:02:49,071 --> 01:02:52,877
I'm good at dumping women, not so good at dumping pistols.

811
01:02:53,475 --> 01:02:58,021
Anyway please take care of my pistol

812
01:02:59,003 --> 01:03:00,500
Thanks

813
01:03:03,290 --> 01:03:05,296
Stay down! I will shoot him

814
01:04:27,212 --> 01:04:27,970
Don't come, It's danger

815
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:42,863
Hey why did you come?

816
01:05:19,053 --> 01:05:19,605
Bros

817
01:06:02,827 --> 01:06:03,827
Who killed him?

818
01:06:04,457 --> 01:06:04,912
Kamoi

819
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,342
Did you kill him?

820
01:06:06,603 --> 01:06:07,118
What?

821
01:06:08,456 --> 01:06:09,516
Don't say bullshit

822
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:11,375
I don't lie like you.

823
01:06:12,123 --> 01:06:15,060
I'm arresting you for illegal possession of a firearm.

824
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,974
Stupid, Look after Mayumi

825
01:06:18,466 --> 01:06:19,029
mayumi?

826
01:06:19,123 --> 01:06:20,380
she has injured her leg

827
01:06:23,495 --> 01:06:24,183
Wait

828
01:06:24,495 --> 01:06:25,089
Leave it

829
01:06:36,036 --> 01:06:36,950
Help me

830
01:06:47,834 --> 01:06:49,428
Ms. Shibata
Your visit

831
01:06:53,874 --> 01:06:56,139
I looked for you

832
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:58,733
You're too noisy

833
01:06:59,139 --> 01:07:00,022
I looked for you

834
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:01,655
Don't say bullshit

835
01:07:02,249 --> 01:07:04,030
How did you know she was here?

836
01:07:04,139 --> 01:07:07,990
The bar is closed.
I went back to my apartment

837
01:07:08,311 --> 01:07:13,233
Neighbors were asking the police to protect her.

838
01:07:13,584 --> 01:07:16,670
They informed me that she was in the hospital here.

839
01:07:16,695 --> 01:07:17,334
I see

840
01:07:17,646 --> 01:07:23,154
I've been on the run from the police.
I also lived in different places.

841
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:24,616
Did you do something bad?

842
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:25,717
No

843
01:07:26,428 --> 01:07:28,780
nasty guy is chasing me.

844
01:07:31,803 --> 01:07:37,397
You know what.
I'm here to tell you that I didn't kill Kawakatsu

845
01:07:38,155 --> 01:07:38,999
Trust me

846
01:07:40,013 --> 01:07:40,935
You can't?

847
01:07:41,318 --> 01:07:45,013
I don't fire bullets that kill people s

848
01:07:47,190 --> 01:07:49,323
I can't avenge your enemies.

849
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:52,291
Kawakatsu got what he deserved.

850
01:07:52,791 --> 01:07:54,330
That's all

851
01:07:54,502 --> 01:07:55,385
Who's the boss?

852
01:07:55,410 --> 01:07:56,674
Forget it

853
01:07:57,213 --> 01:07:58,877
I'm glad you're doing well.

854
01:08:01,080 --> 01:08:01,534
See you

855
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:02,448
Hold on

856
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,846
You know what?if I've been hanging around here, that police come here

857
01:08:07,229 --> 01:08:10,245
I don't like this police hospital.

858
01:08:10,448 --> 01:08:12,041
I want to talk to Kamoi alone.

859
01:08:18,067 --> 01:08:18,716
Hey

860
01:08:23,631 --> 01:08:26,787
She wants to talk to me

861
01:08:26,881 --> 01:08:28,037
Get out of my way, old man.

862
01:08:28,069 --> 01:08:29,420
I don't give a shit.

863
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:31,959
If you get in the way of someone, the horse will kick your ass.

864
01:08:32,045 --> 01:08:34,576
I don't care if I get kicked off.
This is a hospital. I can stay here.

865
01:08:34,601 --> 01:08:36,686
Get out of my way, old man.

866
01:08:36,881 --> 01:08:40,272
I love hearing you talk about this.
I think it's a good story.

867
01:08:40,725 --> 01:08:45,076
He's useless never mind

868
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:46,412
Tell me

869
01:08:55,328 --> 01:08:56,171
What is this?

870
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:58,765
A note on a phone call from the boss.

871
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:00,812
I don't know how he knows I'm here

872
01:09:01,312 --> 01:09:03,796
This is a trouble
You called the police?

873
01:09:04,046 --> 01:09:06,023
He said no to tell them

874
01:09:06,656 --> 01:09:10,562
So Inatori and this gang leader are the only ones alive now.

875
01:09:11,695 --> 01:09:13,124
I don't even know what he looks like.

876
01:09:13,656 --> 01:09:16,320
I don't know when he will come here

877
01:09:17,062 --> 01:09:19,867
Call me as soon as you get out of the hospital.

878
01:09:20,187 --> 01:09:21,867
you will be killed like Henmi and Kawakatsu

879
01:09:21,992 --> 01:09:23,554
That's why I'm scared.

880
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:26,898
where does he always call from?

881
01:09:30,643 --> 01:09:32,518
do you doubt me?

882
01:09:33,104 --> 01:09:34,518
i have nothing to do with it

883
01:09:34,979 --> 01:09:40,713
She can't help but think that you are related to them.

884
01:09:41,794 --> 01:09:43,560
You see a man, you think he's a thief.

885
01:09:50,367 --> 01:09:51,008
I see

886
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,977
Count on me

887
01:09:54,266 --> 01:09:55,016
Hold on

888
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:57,946
Count on me

889
01:10:01,899 --> 01:10:04,126
Where you going?

890
01:10:15,478 --> 01:10:16,454
Where you going?

891
01:10:16,939 --> 01:10:18,032
To USA

892
01:10:19,446 --> 01:10:20,360
just in the neighborhood.

893
01:10:23,509 --> 01:10:24,337
You are strange

894
01:10:26,321 --> 01:10:28,837
I'm gonna need to inspect your attire.

895
01:10:30,071 --> 01:10:31,126
Go ahead

896
01:10:31,384 --> 01:10:33,813
I threw away the PISTOL.

897
01:10:39,132 --> 01:10:41,695
Sorry, I paid you back

898
01:10:43,391 --> 01:10:46,211
Pistol is here

899
01:10:48,961 --> 01:10:49,789
See you

900
01:10:53,823 --> 01:10:55,152
hey

901
01:10:56,441 --> 01:10:59,034
Look after Mayumi,
Your salary goes down

902
01:11:11,566 --> 01:11:14,738
How are you, bros?

903
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:16,637
I forgot your name

904
01:11:16,816 --> 01:11:17,503
what?

905
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:21,457
Today I have more business to do with chickens than with eggs.

906
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:24,188
Hold on

907
01:11:25,367 --> 01:11:26,477
Hold on

908
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:29,985
What did he say?

909
01:11:30,196 --> 01:11:34,875
Today he has more business to do with chickens than with eggs.Wanna stay with us?

910
01:11:35,571 --> 01:11:37,204
He must be Kamoi

911
01:11:39,533 --> 01:11:43,221
Chicken and duck are sukiyaki dishes

912
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:46,424
You are reserved?

913
01:11:46,449 --> 01:11:49,041
I'm here to see a guest named Inatori.

914
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,244
I'm afraid he's not staying with us.

915
01:11:53,721 --> 01:11:56,424
Guest 236 room

916
01:11:57,213 --> 01:11:59,346
He's on a yacht on the beach, sir.

917
01:12:00,838 --> 01:12:02,619
It's connected to the pier behind the hotel.

918
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:04,127
It's easy to find?

919
01:12:04,152 --> 01:12:05,284
The My name is Red Wing

920
01:13:03,481 --> 01:13:04,512
Okay

921
01:14:57,267 --> 01:15:00,986
Don't threaten me like that.

922
01:15:01,314 --> 01:15:02,361
I'm not threatening you.

923
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:03,588
I mean it

924
01:15:04,221 --> 01:15:06,674
Get your hands off of me!

925
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:10,791
I'd rather call you Yoko but not boss

926
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,283
I owe you for your plan.

927
01:15:15,471 --> 01:15:23,986
I'm the one who set you up as the boss in the first place.
Ostensibly as a moneylender so I could get information about the company.

928
01:15:25,056 --> 01:15:29,759
You've taken all the money your friends have accumulated.
You were going to cut us off.

929
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:34,338
You gave Kamoi a lot of information.

930
01:15:35,783 --> 01:15:37,549
You tried to kill me

931
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:41,869
It's for your own protection.
If I don't do it, you do it.

932
01:15:43,057 --> 01:15:46,916
I hired him because I was afraid you'd erase me.

933
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,963
I'm not as stupid as you think

934
01:15:53,273 --> 01:15:55,515
I'm the one who killed Henmi and Kawakatsu

935
01:15:57,117 --> 01:16:00,820
Next is you but I won't kill you

936
01:16:01,984 --> 01:16:07,374
Give me 50% of the share and your body

937
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:11,213
No matter how much you don't like it, I always get what I'm after.

938
01:16:11,635 --> 01:16:12,666
I'll give you money

939
01:16:13,353 --> 01:16:15,681
I don't want belong to you

940
01:16:16,486 --> 01:16:17,861
You've changed your tune.

941
01:16:19,650 --> 01:16:21,080
Kamoi changed you?

942
01:16:22,252 --> 01:16:23,627
If it's money, I'll give you all of it.

943
01:16:24,103 --> 01:16:24,791
Get out of here.

944
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:33,499
Mayumi will come here

945
01:16:33,671 --> 01:16:34,499
Mayumi?

946
01:16:36,884 --> 01:16:38,298
I used your name to call her

947
01:16:40,962 --> 01:16:43,595
As soon as we get rid of her, all the evidence will be gone.

948
01:16:44,806 --> 01:16:46,610
Get big money then fly to Hongkong

949
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:50,407
I'll make your trip a pleasant one

950
01:16:56,068 --> 01:16:57,818
This is how it was supposed to work.

951
01:16:58,576 --> 01:16:59,506
How did you know here?

952
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:00,459
From mayumi

953
01:17:01,279 --> 01:17:05,904
you do a very difficult job.
I heard all your stories

954
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:11,123
if you really love me i will forgive you

955
01:17:11,403 --> 01:17:13,075
I was scared.

956
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:13,990
I'm not going to play that hand.

957
01:17:16,711 --> 01:17:18,984
It's time for us to battle

958
01:17:41,636 --> 01:17:42,370
Ready?

959
01:18:14,164 --> 01:18:15,500
throw the pistol into the sea

960
01:18:22,251 --> 01:18:23,477
throw the pistol into the sea

961
01:18:31,627 --> 01:18:33,299
I was a little earlier

962
01:18:39,294 --> 01:18:41,247
You look great

963
01:18:45,528 --> 01:18:46,669
Don't move or shoot you

964
01:18:52,629 --> 01:18:54,512
throw the pistol

965
01:19:01,668 --> 01:19:05,090
I want you both dead.
I'll call the cops and tell them you shot each other

966
01:19:09,325 --> 01:19:10,598
You better not be joking.

967
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:11,848
I'm going to shoot you.

968
01:19:21,670 --> 01:19:24,107
Thanks for your help.

969
01:19:39,717 --> 01:19:40,310
Come on

970
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:07,401
Go right

971
01:20:15,073 --> 01:20:16,175
What's wrong?

972
01:20:18,425 --> 01:20:19,331
Watch out

973
01:20:39,546 --> 01:20:40,640
Stay strong

974
01:20:43,741 --> 01:20:44,585
Damn it

975
01:21:37,512 --> 01:21:38,457
Watch out

976
01:21:46,161 --> 01:21:47,434
Why you don't shoot?

977
01:21:50,398 --> 01:21:51,758
I'm gonna win this time.

978
01:21:54,219 --> 01:21:55,320
I don't know about that

979
01:22:05,913 --> 01:22:06,530
Ready?

980
01:22:43,511 --> 01:22:44,675
It's just a scratch.

981
01:22:52,104 --> 01:22:54,174
Hey Inatori!
You're under arrest.

982
01:22:59,061 --> 01:22:59,912
Who are you?

983
01:23:00,506 --> 01:23:01,326
We are from the Kitayama Police Department.

984
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:03,420
Detective Kimura called. We're here to help.

985
01:23:04,662 --> 01:23:06,756
Did I hit police?

986
01:23:07,740 --> 01:23:08,655
I’m sorry

987
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,303
I hit police.. I need to leave

988
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:13,639
Detective Sano, wait

989
01:23:14,108 --> 01:23:14,709
Detective

990
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:16,233
Detective ?

991
01:23:17,217 --> 01:23:17,803
Me?

992
01:23:18,608 --> 01:23:20,264
Kimura said Thank you

993
01:23:20,483 --> 01:23:21,506
That shobokure

994
01:23:22,326 --> 01:23:25,217
He told you I'd be police?

995
01:23:25,983 --> 01:23:29,490
That woman... she was wounded by one of their pistols.
Go patch her up.

996
01:23:30,045 --> 01:23:31,897
They're only flesh wounds.

997
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,287
I'm not going to shoot a pistol that's going to kill somebody.

998
01:23:37,530 --> 01:23:38,678
All are under arrest

999
01:23:39,123 --> 01:23:40,858
Take care of the rest.

1000
01:23:41,733 --> 01:23:43,655
I feel good...
See you

1001
01:23:51,565 --> 01:23:52,479
You're fine

1002
01:24:13,478 --> 01:24:14,892
Thank you very much.

1003
01:24:15,642 --> 01:24:17,736
Henmi is glad too

1004
01:24:18,525 --> 01:24:21,892
I'll go back to my country and protect my father's bones.

1005
01:24:23,922 --> 01:24:25,016
Hold on

1006
01:24:28,742 --> 01:24:29,727
I'll go with you.

1007
01:24:30,188 --> 01:24:33,680
If you want to go, give me your pistol

1008
01:24:34,661 --> 01:24:35,762
Don't say bullshit

1009
01:24:36,676 --> 01:24:38,059
Then I'll arrest you

1010

Tears of humanity

1013

That wasn't the deal.

1014

I'm sorry.

1015
01:25:53,959 --> 01:25:56,224
I've never been dumped before in my life.

1016
01:25:56,935 --> 01:25:58,677
She left you because she liked you.

1017
01:25:58,732 --> 01:25:59,584
It could be

1018
01:26:01,662 --> 01:26:02,482
What are you going to do?

1019
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:06,544
you are underpaid.
i don't want to be in your care

1020
01:26:07,201 --> 01:26:08,740
I don't want to eat udon every day

1021

2
00:00:20,889 --> 00:00:23,328
The view of Mount Fuji is really nice today

3
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,554
Are you from Tokyo, ma'am?

4
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:29,031
I was born in this area

5
00:00:29,945 --> 00:00:32,170
I used the bath water from this hot spring.

6
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:37,703
Then you must have gone to Fujimidai Elementary School

7
00:00:37,813 --> 00:00:38,938
Yes.

8
00:00:40,113 --> 00:00:45,507
Are you my classmate?
Well  I was a bit of a junior,

9
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:48,796
Your teacher was Kubo?

10
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:52,003
That strong teacher, right?

11
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:54,898
I wonder if he's doing well?

12
00:00:54,923 --> 00:00:59,398
he actually retired a long time ago.
He hit the principal

13
00:01:00,682 --> 00:01:03,682
I didn't know any of that

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,875
It had been quite a while since I come here.

15
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,633
but he was a good teacher

16
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,210
There were rumors going around about the hot spring geisha with him  in this area

17
00:01:14,015 --> 00:01:16,234
So he argued with the principal.

18
00:01:17,402 --> 00:01:21,171
With all that said, it seems that the geisha was actually one of the his former students

19
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:25,976
Somehow that geisha found a good husband and disappeared from this area,

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,280
but I was also a hot spring geisha

21
00:01:33,914 --> 00:01:36,039
Oh you were?

22
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:37,901
Sorry.

23
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,362
<i>Natsuko Take Off Her Kimono / Obi o toku Natsuko (1965)</i>

24
00:03:01,991 --> 00:03:04,991
Thank you very much.

25
00:03:05,221 --> 00:03:06,901
Welcome back.

26
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,040
Thanks to you,

27
00:03:10,166 --> 00:03:11,596
What do you think this?

28
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:15,166
It looks like department store wrapping paper.

29
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,096
Your  mouth is a bit harsh

30
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:20,385
This is the trend of fortune for this year.

31
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:24,283
there been anything unusual in the world.

32
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:27,487
What's news?

33
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:29,986
There was an order for a party.

34
00:03:30,347 --> 00:03:32,252
Hosome-chan, Wakamatsu-chan, and Ai-chan

35
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,322
You?

36
00:03:34,565 --> 00:03:35,377
Me?

37
00:03:36,018 --> 00:03:38,580
Fuku-chan doesn't want to go to that Imo bros party.

38
00:03:38,666 --> 00:03:39,570
What do you mean by saying that?

39
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:42,135
A man who smells like a potato.

40
00:03:42,174 --> 00:03:44,096
it's a party for the agricultural association

41
00:03:44,513 --> 00:03:45,769
They are our customers.

42
00:03:45,794 --> 00:03:48,197
I can't afford to be picky

43
00:03:51,044 --> 00:03:53,314
This is awesome.

44
00:03:53,494 --> 00:03:54,721
Oh Natsuko's.

45
00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:56,448
Was he here?

46
00:03:56,473 --> 00:03:57,849
As soon as you go out,

47
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,681
She came out of the house right away

48
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:03,056
She' strange

49
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,556
Where did she go?

50
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:06,572
She wants to see Mount Fuji.

51
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,371
but that's just how it is

52
00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:10,895
Whenever she says they want to see Mount Fuji, there's always something going on

53
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:12,936
Speaking of which, she wasn't feeling well,

54
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:16,174
She's becoming more and more dignified as a lady

55
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,720
That means Natsuko's mother must have been a wonderful geisha too

56
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,310
I guess beautiful mothers are just like that

57
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:25,226
When Natsuko was four, She died from eating puffer fish

58
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,189
So, did you raise her all this time?

59
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:31,228
She became a geisha at 16,

60
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,276
but that's not something I'm proud of.

61
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,300
Mom, I've heard that story many times

62
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,424
Natsuko must have been quite popular

63
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,760
Hello,it's Shinkaneya.

64
00:04:44,227 --> 00:04:46,127
Yes, I am.

65
00:04:47,502 --> 00:04:51,353
Well, it's been a while, Kawashima-san

66
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:56,158
Honestly, let's skip the greetings and get right to it; Natsuko-san is probably on her way there

67
00:04:57,093 --> 00:04:59,580
I see,She's there

68
00:05:01,002 --> 00:05:03,299
Well then, I'll switch to the president

69
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:05,869
She's out now?

70
00:05:06,987 --> 00:05:10,845
Yeah, actually there are various complicated circumstances

71
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,736
Well, it's not a big deal, I want to talk to her anyway.

72
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:19,353
Yes, I'll talk

73
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,630
Hello, this is Sakuma.

74
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:28,392
It's been a while, President

75
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,861
I'm sorry I couldn't go to your wife's funeral.

76
00:05:33,173 --> 00:05:36,299
What's wrong with Natsuko?

77
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:37,805
She's saying she wants to break up.

78
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,260
5 years with her and she said she wanted to break up

79
00:05:42,143 --> 00:05:43,533
It's completely out of the question

80
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,510
There was a strange rumor

81
00:05:47,452 --> 00:05:49,877
There is a rumor that I am going to remarry.

82
00:05:50,593 --> 00:05:52,361
Remarriage

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,036
What are you talking about?

84
00:05:56,619 --> 00:05:57,413
Is it a problem to joke around?

85
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,783
That's why Natsuko lost her cool
and left.

86
00:06:03,203 --> 00:06:05,017
It's because her husband didn't provide enough service

87
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,713
that Natsuko went crazy

88
00:06:07,115 --> 00:06:09,530
Oh, there's no doubt about that

89
00:06:09,555 --> 00:06:11,510
You're not that old yet,

90
00:06:11,535 --> 00:06:12,822
so please get it together

91
00:06:13,076 --> 00:06:16,799
Last month, you received medical compensation at the racetrack, right?

92
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:19,463
It's not that troublesome?

93
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,486
You don't have to bathe your whole body

94
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,476
It's fine to focus only on the areas
you want to strengthen

95
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,500
Well, well, I appreciate that

96
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,100
and I'll take my time to rely on you regarding for nasuko

97
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,606
Got it, got it, I'll hustle hard from now on

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,791
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

99
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,564
She's an old woman who never loses her charm

100
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,150
She must have been quite something in her younger days

101
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:50,908
I heard that She loved a certain sumo wrestler and even chased after him to the tour location

102
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:55,517
She used a futon as a Sumo ring

103
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,002
But is she okay?

104
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:00,240
If you'd like,

105
00:07:00,265 --> 00:07:01,491
I can go over there

106
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,924
and meet with Natsuko directly,

107
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:05,150
that would be appreciated.

108
00:07:05,693 --> 00:07:08,309
After all, I can't consult about Natsuko

109
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:10,025
You're the only one here

110
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:11,463
Thank you very much.

111
00:07:12,154 --> 00:07:14,385
The president and Natsuko's tie

112
00:07:14,497 --> 00:07:15,939
It's me, after all

113
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:19,230
I didn't expect him to take on Natsuko along with the president's chair

114
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,090
it's only been three months since the former president and Natsuko was together

115
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:24,659
It's nothing.

116
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,686
It's been five years since then; time flies, doesn't it?

117
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:28,986
Absolutely

118
00:07:29,688 --> 00:07:33,689
Thanks to the president, Natsuko has completely nicer

119
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:35,674
it's hard to let go of her.

120
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:37,644
She is very affectionate

121
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,627
I think there's a difference between amateurs and professionals

122
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,916
You should make new rules

123
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:43,916
Don't say bullshit.

124
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,252
Seriously

125
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:46,393
You think so?

126
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,599
I'm kinda....

127
00:07:51,885 --> 00:07:54,416
What's the rule?

128
00:07:55,483 --> 00:07:57,830
that's what that law is

129
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:01,322
The law is becoming an issue in this session of the Diet

130
00:08:02,198 --> 00:08:06,651
This is the law of the financial industry.

131
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:09,791
and as the financial situation evolves into this kind of world, various laws will emerge

132
00:08:09,816 --> 00:08:12,159
You came late.

133
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:13,908
Was there an accident or something?

134
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,618
No,There was plenty of time before the plane arrived.

135
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,893
it's been a while

136
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,566
it's been a while too.

137
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:26,135
It seems my brother has been taken care of
in various ways,

138
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:28,534
Not at all.

139
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,736
President, I need to go.

140
00:08:32,761 --> 00:08:34,534
I would like you to take it easy for a while,

141
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,080
but I also have to go out soon

142
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:39,994
President

143
00:08:41,541 --> 00:08:42,885
Well...

144
00:08:44,143 --> 00:08:45,448
You need a gift,

145
00:08:48,203 --> 00:08:51,181
I had you pay for it last month.

146
00:08:51,221 --> 00:08:51,994
It was 50,000.

147
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,494
Not 30000yen?

148
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,478
Brother, you're not up to any mischief again, are you?

149
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,268
What?

150
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:08,900
I hate Kawashima

151
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:10,627
He is quite a good guy

152
00:09:12,201 --> 00:09:13,817
If anything happens that makes Taeko cry,

153
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,392
I won't stand for it,

154
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,846
so shall we head out soon?

155
00:09:20,796 --> 00:09:22,963
President goes to Haneda Airport

156
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:29,681
Don't try to fool me.
I know it's now law matter.

157
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,517
Are you doing it too?

158
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,752
Are you kidding?

159
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:35,580
Would a woman do that?

160
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,823
You're right.

161
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,705
What happened?

162
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,814
Sometimes I get stomach aches

163
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:48,556
I've been feeling unwell since this morning.

164
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:50,954
You're pretending to be sick

165
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:52,174
What do you mean?

166
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,366
Brother, you actually dislike the idea of marrying Taeko, don't you?

167
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,642
It's very profitable for the company.

168
00:10:00,435 --> 00:10:02,306
Why would I, as the president, dislike it?

169
00:10:03,776 --> 00:10:05,580
That's fine,

170
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,150
but I was wondering if there is someone you might love

171
00:10:10,634 --> 00:10:12,221
Don't use your imagination.

172
00:10:13,466 --> 00:10:16,252
Well, anyway, let's go.

173
00:10:16,852 --> 00:10:18,128
Are you alright?

174
00:10:18,503 --> 00:10:20,103
I’ll go even if it’s difficult

175
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:26,025
It’s easy to say, but you broke up, so what are you supposed to do?

176
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,619
I’ll work again at this hot spring resort,

177
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,080
and then you’ll find another husband?

178
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,314
Isn’t that just a pointless repetition? If that’s the
case, it’s better to endure things as they are for now

179
00:10:36,455 --> 00:10:39,010
At this point, Get the allowance will be significantly increased

180
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,947
How much are you getting now?

181
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:43,471
Is it the amount you take home?

182
00:10:43,774 --> 00:10:45,541
Don't talk like the tax office

183
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,549
Well, the salary hasn't changed from last year

184
00:10:47,893 --> 00:10:49,705
It's bad.

185
00:10:50,357 --> 00:10:52,088
I don't care that money matter.

186
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:53,276
That's bad.

187
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,221
You make a living from it

188
00:10:56,039 --> 00:10:58,010
A professional has to be professional and draw the line

189
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,517
You give service a lot instead.

190
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:07,994
But you You've become more refined but you've
lost your allure, haven't you?

191
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:11,291
Even though you have such a nice skin tone,

192
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:14,918
are you really staring like that?

193
00:11:15,596 --> 00:11:17,322
Are you not having sex right now?

194
00:11:18,877 --> 00:11:19,931
What do you mean?

195
00:11:20,354 --> 00:11:23,541
Don't act like an amateur

196
00:11:25,502 --> 00:11:26,935
That's the worst, Mom.

197
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,291
That's an incredibly great worry

198
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,377
Are you still in there?

199
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,030
Someone is here to pick you up from Tokyo

200
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,643
Well...

201
00:11:40,311 --> 00:11:42,158
The president is selfish

202
00:11:42,607 --> 00:11:46,408
I can't think of anyone other than Natsuko-san for wife.

203
00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:48,915
You're good, Kawashima-san.

204
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:53,658
Honestly,even if I could have half of what the president has,

205
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:57,020
If I had a bit of wealth, I wouldn't just leave Natsuko-san like this

206
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,494
Well, that's a nice thing to say,

207
00:11:59,623 --> 00:12:02,767
How about taking a trip around here for a change of pace?

208
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,517
That sounds great

209
00:12:04,861 --> 00:12:05,713
Natsuko

210
00:12:07,447 --> 00:12:09,486
have a good time fro a few days!

211
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:13,624
then if that's decided, I might just speed off in the car right now

212
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:15,911
Fuku-chan, come along with us too

213
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:19,545
Let's go, cheerful sister

214
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,423
As for you, your business has come up

215
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:23,689
I was allowed by her.

216
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,649
Well, you see,I'll serve you.

217
00:12:26,838 --> 00:12:29,478
it's about Natsuko-san

218
00:12:29,926 --> 00:12:32,926
I assure you, Kawashima-san, Natsuko is still not broken up with her husband.

219
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,270
it's troubling to be suspected of having ulterior motives

220
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:41,200
I am just a fan of Natsuko-san

221
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:45,210
You're on Her husband's side, right?

222
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:47,942
It's really cold, very cold

223
00:12:48,689 --> 00:12:52,088
If you really are on my side,

224
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:54,370
won't you help me save face?

225
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,737
What do you mean?

226
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,770
Will you persuade Papa-san to reconsider marriage?

227
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:03,383
Or will he settle things nicely with me?

228
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,607
Natsuko

229
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,656
but the president is getting old.
You just need to be patient

230
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,763
I'll tell him.

231
00:13:11,161 --> 00:13:12,499
I’m sorry.

232
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,736
No, no, I absolutely won't take the phone.

233
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,960
You're such a spoiled child

234
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,024
that's right

235
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:22,848
This is the residence in Kameoka

236
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,710
Shoichi?
Who?

237
00:13:27,676 --> 00:13:30,826
Well, main house's

238
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,577
What? The president ?did what?

239
00:13:34,343 --> 00:13:35,568
Did something happen?

240
00:13:35,593 --> 00:13:38,919
I'll pass the phone to Natsuko.

241
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,403
I heard that the president collapsed at at Haneda Airport

242
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:43,901
This is Natsuko

243
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,410
I heard about you from my husband.

244
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:49,753
Oh Papa

245
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:53,922
He suddenly collapsed at the airport and was rushed to the hospital

246
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,010
It seems they closed the peritoneum

247
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:00,741
I thought I'd let you know.

248
00:14:01,438 --> 00:14:02,658
I see.

249
00:14:03,723 --> 00:14:05,599
Thank you

250
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,921
It's not something you need to thank me so much for

251
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,657
Also, it's better if you try not to come to the hospital for various reasons.

252
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,846
In return, I will take responsibility

253
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,654
and make sure to inform you

254
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:20,050
Thank you very much indeed

255
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,240
Did he pass away?

256
00:14:25,545 --> 00:14:26,114
 No,

257
00:14:26,611 --> 00:14:28,195
I’m sorry.

258
00:14:29,019 --> 00:14:31,779
Shoichi is really nice guy.

259
00:14:35,597 --> 00:14:38,657
your father returned to the hospital room

260
00:14:39,409 --> 00:14:41,534
They said it was almost too late

261
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:49,379
Since it's right after the surgery, there will be a bit of a fever

262
00:14:55,296 --> 00:14:59,020
Taiko, you can go ahead and back in hotel now

263
00:14:59,549 --> 00:15:02,549
I truly apologize for the trouble I've caused you

264
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:06,944
Last year, I was almost always by my father's side while he was hospitalized for stomach ulcer surgery

265
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,878
I'm used to dealing with patients

266
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,306
But it's a shame that you finally went out
to have some fun after a long time

267
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:19,778
But you know, my brother absolutely needs someone like you

268
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,230
I look forward to your assistance

269
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:27,130
My father is also very much in favor of this discussion;

270
00:15:27,513 --> 00:15:30,349
the reason I came so suddenly is regarding the wedding

271
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,800
I wanted to consult with you,

272
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,376
and my brother will be fine soon

273
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,437
He is originally a sturdy person,

274
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,246
so our conversation with you

275
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:42,729
It would be better to do it as soon as possible

276
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,997
Hey, Shoichi, you shouldn't be wandering around like that,

277
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,689
Taiko is really tired

278
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,594
Take her to hotel

279
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,456
I'll be taking care of things here tonight

280
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:53,715
But in that case...

281
00:15:53,975 --> 00:15:55,335
, please don't worry at all

282
00:15:56,983 --> 00:15:58,183
You're so kind.

283
00:15:59,053 --> 00:16:01,526
Say thank her

284
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,466
You're undependable

285
00:16:10,012 --> 00:16:10,898
Natsuko

286
00:16:15,669 --> 00:16:16,710
What's wrong?

287
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:19,906
He said something, right?

288
00:16:21,553 --> 00:16:23,999
You want a summer orange?

289
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,372
Oh no

290
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,586
but you can't have any moisture

291
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,020
Dad, that's not okay

292
00:16:29,536 --> 00:16:32,536
When he has a fever, he really crave fruit

293
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,157
Hello.

294
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,144
How's papa?

295
00:17:01,804 --> 00:17:04,122
like the results are quite good

296
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:07,272
I wanna visit him just for a moment.

297
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:10,510
but it seems that many main residence people are gathered

298
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:13,708
I would like to meet Shoichi,

299
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,753
I will take the opportunity to bring you along someday

300
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,055
Since it's late tonight,

301
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,156
I'll accompany you home

302
00:17:18,187 --> 00:17:20,713
It's fine, just stay by Papa's side

303
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,952
I won't leave Natsuko-san alone at a time like this

304
00:17:25,302 --> 00:17:26,258
Please go

305
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:27,596
Excuse me.

306
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:34,430
I'm tired.

307
00:17:53,257 --> 00:17:54,730
Thank you for your patience

308
00:17:55,243 --> 00:17:59,000
It's a bit stylish to be able to hear a song at the perm shop

309
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,106
I really like this

310
00:18:01,573 --> 00:18:03,329
I'm looking forward to it.

311
00:18:28,945 --> 00:18:32,736
Today, you are different because you've learnt singing

312
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,150
I feel happy when I'm praised, but it's just singing

313
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:38,446
It's still strange, isn't it?

314
00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:40,616
You are improved

315
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,400
because the teacher is good

316
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,139
Thank you for your hard work

317
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,586
Don't worry about me,

318
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,496
I'm fine

319
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,766
If you're going out, have a good time

320
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,344
Are you going out?

321
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:53,343
I'm just going to school,

322
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,564
He's a member of PTA.

323
00:18:56,031 --> 00:18:57,278
It's hard.

324
00:18:57,303 --> 00:19:00,194
He is the son of the main family.
It can't be helped.

325
00:19:00,219 --> 00:19:01,155
Are you staying over?

326
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:02,068
I'll be back tonight

327
00:19:02,373 --> 00:19:03,531
Make sure to take a bath

328
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,549
I won't be coming to your stupid place

329
00:19:05,574 --> 00:19:06,809
I can't believe it.

330
00:19:06,834 --> 00:19:07,802
Take your time.

331
00:19:11,338 --> 00:19:13,189
You're quite straightforward, aren't you?

332
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,456
Well, if someone who doesn't know me sees this,

333
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,816
they would probably think I'm the real wife

334
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,840
I hear he visit you once a week

335
00:19:21,629 --> 00:19:22,565
That's right

336
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:25,018
He came back after playing with the kids on Sunday night

337
00:19:25,238 --> 00:19:27,152
Saturday night is the problem.

338
00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:29,029
He hasn't said anything,

339
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:31,205
but it seems that he's had a baby.

340
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,325
It's disgusting.

341
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:42,713
How's your husband like?

342
00:19:43,206 --> 00:19:46,206
I can't say anything

343
00:19:46,289 --> 00:19:48,439
I haven't visited him even once

344
00:19:48,943 --> 00:19:51,324
Why not just go?

345
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,357
It's not that easy.

346
00:19:54,023 --> 00:19:58,309
having a kind girlfriend like you is so happy.

347
00:20:05,589 --> 00:20:09,410
Natsuko, I can tell you're feeling a bit needy, huh?

348
00:20:10,094 --> 00:20:11,288
How dare you

349
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:14,405
There's a phone call

350
00:20:14,453 --> 00:20:15,780
Me?

351
00:20:16,752 --> 00:20:18,859
It's me,Sono.

352
00:20:20,247 --> 00:20:23,850
if that's the case, I'll really head home right away

353
00:20:25,774 --> 00:20:26,845
Thank you for having me

354
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,200
Oh, isn't it still fine?

355
00:20:28,225 --> 00:20:30,271
We need to give you this month's tuition as well

356
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:31,542
anytime is fine.

357
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:34,177
What's wrong?

358
00:20:46,981 --> 00:20:48,021
Welcome home.

359
00:20:48,305 --> 00:20:50,267
He's looking forward to seeing you

360
00:20:57,888 --> 00:21:00,888
I'll prepare the bath

361
00:21:25,185 --> 00:21:25,899
Natsuko.

362
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,005
Papa.

363
00:21:30,157 --> 00:21:31,110
How are you?

364
00:21:33,634 --> 00:21:34,954
Natsuko.

365
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:41,974
This smell...

366
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:43,427
Natsuko's

367
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,002
Today, for the first time, I was allowed to take a bath

368
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,980
and while I was soaking in the hot water,

369
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,566
I just couldn't help but want to see Natsuko

370
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:55,139
I secretly snuck out of the hospital

371
00:21:56,669 --> 00:21:59,069
Have you been discharged yet?

372
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:02,565
So I can't afford to take it.

373
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:04,371
Ok?

374
00:22:05,703 --> 00:22:06,449
You can't

375
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,148
Your body still isn't well enough, is it?

376
00:22:09,596 --> 00:22:13,171
Moreover, the conclusion of the important discussion has not been reached yet

377
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,424
What are you saying?

378
00:22:15,356 --> 00:22:17,834
Are we breaking up? My illness cancels that out

379
00:22:18,719 --> 00:22:22,326
It's been a month, so there's no need to say something boring

380
00:22:22,619 --> 00:22:25,167
But for me, it's important

381
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,430
When you decide on a new wife at your main residence

382
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I can't continue living like this,

383
00:22:35,113 --> 00:22:36,560
Don't make me mess

384
00:22:38,345 --> 00:22:39,165
You know what?

385
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:45,295
I was only thinking about you in that hospital room

386
00:22:47,211 --> 00:22:50,095
I've always wanted to do so many things with you.

387
00:22:50,666 --> 00:22:53,666
but what about you? Have you come to dislike me?

388
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:55,753
Don't get me wrong.

389
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,742
But let's talk first.

390
00:22:57,767 --> 00:22:58,951
Don't be selfish.

391
00:22:59,757 --> 00:23:01,168
Can we talk later.

392
00:23:02,566 --> 00:23:05,566
It's more important that my unauthorized outing doesn't get found out

393
00:23:06,866 --> 00:23:08,395
Listen to what I say

394
00:23:09,606 --> 00:23:10,917
It's strange.

395
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:13,245
It's still noon.

396
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:15,439
We always have no plan.

397
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:17,520
This isn't something that only happens today

398
00:23:19,415 --> 00:23:22,195
Natsuko, come on.

399
00:23:25,165 --> 00:23:27,255
today is fine, you know

400
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
But, husband?

401
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:31,168
Natsuko

402
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,325
Don't you need to go shopping for dinner?

403
00:23:34,936 --> 00:23:36,524
You went to the market, right?

404
00:23:36,598 --> 00:23:38,938
But He said like that.

405
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:41,234
I'm going to department store again.

406
00:23:41,785 --> 00:23:44,785
Take your time

407
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,730
and be careful

408
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,132
She's careful woman

409
00:24:08,268 --> 00:24:08,948
Natsuko

410
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,207
What?

411
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:12,763
What's the hell?

412
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:15,106
Come this way

413
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:18,207
You're so self-centered

414
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:21,566
I think it would be better to resist the natural course of things later on

415
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:27,327
I don't have to do that now.

416
00:24:28,682 --> 00:24:31,478
How about you untie your obi?

417
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,696
No

418
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:33,708
Are you still frustrated?

419
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:36,404
Alright, can I help?

420
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:41,405
Are you alright?

421
00:24:41,437 --> 00:24:43,163
Was that too much?

422
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,224
Should I call a doctor?

423
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,897
No

424
00:24:46,156 --> 00:24:47,757
Can you rub here?

425
00:24:50,375 --> 00:24:51,702
You...

426
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:55,503
It's all about you.

427
00:24:57,423 --> 00:24:58,520
What a nice.

428
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:02,406
You're very bad.

429
00:25:03,532 --> 00:25:05,653
It's been a while since we last met

430
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:17,653
Please be careful with strong things

431
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,576
Dad.

432
00:26:03,652 --> 00:26:04,718
Oh you are here.

433
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:09,581
Patients must follow the hospital rules

434
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,850
If the doctor finds out, it'll be a big deal

435
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:16,730
Everybody's been looking for you

436
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,035
I’m sorry.

437
00:26:18,776 --> 00:26:21,265
I had something I was a bit concerned about

438
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,558
I went to the bank,

439
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,167
It was important that I needed to go.

440
00:26:34,549 --> 00:26:38,558
Maybe I've walked too much, my back hurts

441
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,792
Was there something you needed?

442
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,445
I thought I'd take a look at that

443
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:49,558
What?

444
00:26:52,563 --> 00:26:54,566
Isn't that a wedding invitation?

445
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:55,207
Yes.

446
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:00,147
Oh my, have you already decided on the date?

447
00:27:01,063 --> 00:27:04,063
In this case, it seems better to do it as soon as possible

448
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:07,293
Ms. Taiko has returned home for now on the morning flight

449
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:12,581
Next time, we decided to discuss the detailed arrangements for the wedding

450
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,105
You work very fast.

451
00:27:14,878 --> 00:27:19,402
It's been approved at the executive level.

452
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,800
You should be more aware

453
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,250
Mr. Shoichi, please watch him

454
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:32,130
Well then, I'll head home a bit earlier

455
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,870
She seems very frustrated

456
00:27:41,932 --> 00:27:42,964
Of course

457
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,027
Were you at Kamioka?

458
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,362
Where's cigarette?

459
00:27:55,253 --> 00:27:58,079
I was so pursued and in trouble.

460
00:27:58,103 --> 00:28:00,628
Women can become strict when they turn 40 years old.

461
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,596
Has anything changed at the company?

462
00:28:07,621 --> 00:28:08,956
Not really

463
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,620
I really need you to hold back

464
00:28:13,645 --> 00:28:19,581
I understand, and Natsuko was grateful for what you did

465
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,836
You were the first to inform me about my condition

466
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,800
It was you, wasn't it?

467
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:26,566
You were nice.

468
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,862
Now I half-regret now

469
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,340
It's easier to maintain neutrality regarding your private life

470
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,766
I'm still tired

471
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,776
It's still impossible

472
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,574
What?

473
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:42,410
It's ok.

474
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,370
Why don't we go for golf later

475
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,173
It's been a while

476
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,800
It's good for your health

477
00:28:57,847 --> 00:28:59,230
Thank you very much.

478
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:11,222
Ma'am.

479
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,261
It's sad to be alone, isn't it?

480
00:29:13,286 --> 00:29:14,269
Why?

481
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,644
Because...

482
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,675
I'm shy

483
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:23,222
What's wrong?

484
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:27,832
I'm sorry.

485
00:29:27,945 --> 00:29:30,167
Oh, Kawashima, how unusual!

486
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:33,970
I suddenly wanted to see you.

487
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,339
Do you expand the house?

488
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:41,073
May I come in?

489
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:45,230
The weather is very nice.

490
00:29:45,546 --> 00:29:49,128
You came to see me because Papa asked you right?

491
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:52,465
Don't get me wrong.

492
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,456
I came because I was concerned about you.

493
00:29:55,481 --> 00:29:57,817
There's no need to worry;

494
00:29:57,842 --> 00:30:00,608
I've long since given up

495
00:30:01,222 --> 00:30:05,182
It's no use chasing him.

496
00:30:05,658 --> 00:30:06,441
No way.

497
00:30:07,064 --> 00:30:10,064
The president doesn't hate you and is marrying another wife.

498
00:30:10,749 --> 00:30:12,636
He's just concerned about public opinion

499
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:14,285
He said like that.

500
00:30:14,498 --> 00:30:17,498
It seems like all men say similar things

501
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:22,063
I can start getting involved in work as early as next week

502
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,336
Thank you for your hard work

503
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,534
Thank you

504
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:28,402
but the president seems to be quite considerate, doesn't he?

505
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,245
What kind of expansion will you be doing this time?

506
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,566
Tea house

507
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,238
That's good.

508
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:40,614
You saw this too, right?

509
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,918
This....

510
00:30:47,375 --> 00:30:49,316
This is the invitation to the president's wedding reception

511
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,222
He probably sent me for example.

512
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:54,987
He is very nosy.

513
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,140
No, it's truly surprising

514
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,909
Who did this?

515
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,966
I want to know

516
00:31:04,139 --> 00:31:05,831
At first, I thought it was you

517
00:31:05,856 --> 00:31:07,035
Give me a break

518
00:31:07,684 --> 00:31:09,730
There's no way I would do something like that

519
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:11,488
Is someone making fun of me?

520
00:31:12,597 --> 00:31:14,739
If it comes to this, I'll be stubborn about it

521
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
No matter what anyone says, I'm not going to break up with Papa

522
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:21,756
That's for sure; there's absolutely no need

523
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:25,310
You know, I think I might try to meet that Taeko person

524
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:28,353
That's not good, ma'am

525
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:29,050
Why?

526
00:31:29,075 --> 00:31:30,925
This is not good idea.

527
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,730
It's very dangerous for the two of you to meet.

528
00:31:34,334 --> 00:31:35,870
I think you're very hated

529
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:39,730
Who on earth would make a woman do such a disgraceful thing?

530
00:31:40,152 --> 00:31:44,284
Of course, it's the president's way, but This is not good idea.

531
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,175
Try forgiving the president with this.

532
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:47,876
You will be a problem

533
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,261
What does it mean?

534
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,495
It can't be helped.

535
00:31:52,194 --> 00:31:56,394
Generous people like me are easily made fun of by others.

536
00:31:56,816 --> 00:31:57,683
What's the hell?

537
00:31:58,058 --> 00:31:59,121
Of course.

538
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:04,349
I can't tolerate any more insults than this

539
00:32:05,379 --> 00:32:08,668
If you meet papa, tell him this

540
00:32:09,425 --> 00:32:14,073
If you really love me, please treat me like a human being.

541
00:32:43,097 --> 00:32:44,784
This is the fourth row

542
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:48,495
You remembered him, didn't you?

543
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,628
I came here because I want you to forget him.

544
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,530
It's just about the time the wedding has started

545
00:32:57,886 --> 00:32:59,157
It's too late to regret it now

546
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:00,472
But it can't be helped

547
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:07,730
Forget about that.
What house you bet?

548
00:33:08,777 --> 00:33:12,519
Star Ruby, Papa likes her.

549
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:28,542
Your predictions are excellent

550
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:31,308
I can't believe Star Rubin would win

551
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,988
We got a lot of money

552
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,995
I was able to treat you

553
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,236
I'll enjoy the feast

554
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,237
Where should we go?

555
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,480
How about some Kawagoe cuisine around here?

556
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,987
Be careful

557
00:33:52,518 --> 00:33:53,941
What are you doing?

558
00:33:53,966 --> 00:33:56,261
You're speeding over there

559
00:33:56,654 --> 00:33:59,409
That car was just picked up from a factory.

560
00:33:59,742 --> 00:34:00,938
This one is a brand new car

561
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:02,112
Look at that wound.

562
00:34:02,487 --> 00:34:04,563
The dump truck driver drives recklessly.

563
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,409
Aren't you drinking or something?

564
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:07,070
You idiot

565
00:34:07,095 --> 00:34:08,501
I don't drink from the daytime.

566
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:10,136
Don't assume I'm a woman

567
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,738
I have witnesses

568
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Isn't it because you're wearing colored glasses

569
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:26,590
Kubo teacher.

570
00:34:27,183 --> 00:34:28,394
Nacchan.

571
00:34:28,902 --> 00:34:30,355
Come with me.

572
00:34:30,566 --> 00:34:32,410
It's been ages.

573
00:34:40,182 --> 00:34:45,076
I never thought that you worked at a car repair shop

574
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,472
Could you stop calling me Sensei, please?

575
00:34:47,582 --> 00:34:49,808
Should I call you Kubo-san?

576
00:34:50,144 --> 00:34:51,081
Or Kenji?

577
00:34:52,279 --> 00:34:55,279
You really are a teacher after all

578
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,823
But you've changed, haven't you?

579
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,581
You've become quite impressive

580
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,073
You seem like a bourgeois young lady

581
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:06,170
As I mentioned earlier, that's how I feel about myself

582
00:35:06,470 --> 00:35:07,917
Please don't make a fool of me.

583
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:12,370
But you look happy

584
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,168
Let's drink

585
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:17,167
I haven't asked anything about you at all.

586
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:20,180
I think you're probably married already.

587
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,839
I am a clumsy guy

588
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,964
I still haven't caught a single one

589
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,019
Your ideals are too high?

590
00:35:26,044 --> 00:35:28,308
I'm doing my best to keep up

591
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,480
I can't afford to get married.

592
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,746
I think you have at least one person you like.

593
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,683
you're still so young.
You think you are inconvenient being alone

594
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:37,644
For what?

595
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:39,448
I mean.

596
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,760
You are stupid.

597
00:35:43,221 --> 00:35:44,424
That's silly

598
00:35:44,778 --> 00:35:46,479
I'm like that.

599
00:35:47,484 --> 00:35:52,744
But you are still shy as always, in a way that doesn't change

600
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,980
I still sometimes remember things from the past

601
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,424
It was a short teaching career,

602
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,119
but I have a deep impression of you

603
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,856
You want to become a great geisha and succeed in the future by having to write an essay

604
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,880
There was a time when I was troubled

605
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:11,674
I was scolded quite a bit, wasn't I?

606
00:36:12,565 --> 00:36:16,986
But I was happy about it

607
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,342
Do you remember what happened that night?

608
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:23,049
What do you mean?

609
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,080
You are pretending not to know

610
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,424
You are mean.

611
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:33,222
It was about my most dangerous night

612
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:40,276
Nacchan, Nacchan

613
00:36:42,253 --> 00:36:43,596
Did you see her?

614
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,658
She's not in the hall

615
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,268
Kusumi is waiting for her

616
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:50,579
Oh my god.

617
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:52,706
She might have gone home, so just to be safe,

618
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,886
try calling and see what they say

619
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:54,713
Yes.

620
00:36:56,229 --> 00:36:58,229
What on earth is she doing?

621
00:37:28,276 --> 00:37:29,338
What's that?

622
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:31,126
peach-colored outfit

623
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:32,385
You look good.

624
00:37:32,487 --> 00:37:33,510
Thanks.

625
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,480
I won.

626
00:37:40,557 --> 00:37:42,307
Damn it.

627
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:45,485
I skipped work and came here.

628
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,518
Are you okay if you don't come back?

629
00:37:51,026 --> 00:37:53,632
Please order me tonight

630
00:37:54,452 --> 00:37:56,291
A cheap price is fine too.

631
00:37:57,245 --> 00:37:59,771
Your salary is low, so I'll pay later.

632
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:01,760
Don't say things like that.

633
00:38:02,479 --> 00:38:04,850
I am still an adult

634
00:38:05,336 --> 00:38:10,213
My breasts are small but people say they are nicely shaped.

635
00:38:10,673 --> 00:38:13,673
Speaking of which, you looked the most mature during the physical examination

636
00:38:13,893 --> 00:38:16,385
but that's just part of our business

637
00:38:17,434 --> 00:38:20,434
Naturally, it's surprisingly so

638
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,306
Were you watching me?

639
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,247
Can't be helped, can it?

640
00:38:25,849 --> 00:38:29,729
Then take responsibility for having seen me naked

641
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,252
Please take responsibility for this matter

642
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:32,631
If I took on that responsibility,

643
00:38:32,959 --> 00:38:36,197
I have to marry every woman in my class.

644
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:38,916
But even the teacher...

645
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,182
Eventually, marriage, when will that be?

646
00:38:41,207 --> 00:38:42,081
Yes.

647
00:38:42,503 --> 00:38:43,768
With what kind of person?

648
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,705
What kind of women do you like?

649
00:38:47,104 --> 00:38:48,190
I have no idea.

650
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:51,497
Don't say that, just tell me

651
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:52,869
That's right

652
00:38:54,652 --> 00:38:57,652
Clean, cute, and modest

653
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:01,832
She forgives my selfishness

654
00:39:02,057 --> 00:39:04,557
Am I bad?

655
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:15,322
I'll take you.

656
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,260
No

657
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:18,815
that's a problem. I have some research to do,

658
00:39:19,307 --> 00:39:20,026
No

659
00:39:21,102 --> 00:39:23,208
You are a novice

660
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,276
Go home quietly

661
00:39:29,547 --> 00:39:30,190
What's wrong?

662
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,063
Are you crying?

663
00:39:33,753 --> 00:39:35,283
There's something strange about you tonight

664
00:39:45,807 --> 00:39:47,385
I was a kid.

665
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:53,088
But you knew my true feelings,

666
00:39:53,113 --> 00:39:55,440
and even if they knew, there was nothing to be done about it

667
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,221
That was good in its own way

668
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,791
That's why you can wear such a splendid kimono

669
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:08,373
and adorn your fingers with amazing jewels

670
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,860
Becoming the wife of a man who still can't be independent at this age

671
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,252
and is doing such things

672
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:19,170
You must have managed to keep those beautiful hands from getting chapped

673
00:40:19,787 --> 00:40:23,515
You thinks that I am living a satisfying life?

674
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,111
Well, no one can live a completely fulfilling life every day

675
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,950
You chose your own path,

676
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,046
so don't get distracted

677
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,997
and trip over trivial stones

678
00:40:38,928 --> 00:40:42,231
As expected, you're a teacher; giving lectures is your specialty

679
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,256
Shall I bring beer?

680
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:49,748
Yes.

681
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,046
Well, no, it's fine now

682
00:40:51,093 --> 00:40:52,068
I have to go now

683
00:40:52,093 --> 00:40:53,803
Please stay here.

684
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:55,169
No, really, it's fine,.

685
00:40:55,194 --> 00:40:56,045
I get it.

686
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,740
Please come to my house

687
00:41:03,622 --> 00:41:05,505
I'm going to be scolded by Sakuma-san.

688
00:41:06,395 --> 00:41:08,966
Is it okay to do a little bad thing tonight?

689
00:41:09,497 --> 00:41:10,950
Come over to my place

690
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:15,450
If you don't like my place,
a bar or a nightclub is fine too

691
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:16,919
I will accompany you

692
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,466
After all, we finally met

693
00:41:19,491 --> 00:41:21,490
I don't want to say good bye.

694
00:41:22,786 --> 00:41:25,700
His new wife is in good health.

695
00:41:26,278 --> 00:41:28,224
I wonder if his body can handle it

696
00:41:28,834 --> 00:41:31,834
She has a mole on her face.

697
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:33,021
It means she is compassionate.

698
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:35,607
Yes,that's it.

699
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:39,316
Is this Sakurai?
This tobacco is very good

700
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:45,216
I'm worried that he might not come here anymore.

701
00:41:49,814 --> 00:41:52,529
you know? Natsuko really has to hustle

702
00:41:53,004 --> 00:41:54,568
Did she really say to go to horse racing?

703
00:41:54,701 --> 00:41:55,146
Yes.

704
00:41:55,511 --> 00:41:56,419
Still, it's late

705
00:41:57,875 --> 00:41:59,901
She didn't actually go to see Mount Fuji?

706
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,482
Mount Fuji?

707
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,196
There are times when she get really frustrated

708
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,220
She often come to see Mount Fuji

709
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,760
I don't know how to run this house.

710
00:42:12,354 --> 00:42:16,857
You only have tea, so you must have whiskey, right?

711
00:42:18,199 --> 00:42:20,935
But you know, she rarely serves customers

712
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,490
She puts it in a locked locker.

713
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,856
Just bring it

714
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,796
The key is with the wife,

715
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,575
so she's careful.

716
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,668
I'm sorry.

717
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:33,950
I was treated to a feast at the hotel

718
00:42:33,975 --> 00:42:35,388
Please don't worry

719
00:42:35,592 --> 00:42:36,622
What's the hell?

720
00:42:36,896 --> 00:42:39,355
She's back

721
00:42:40,709 --> 00:42:42,099
I'm home.

722
00:42:47,528 --> 00:42:50,528
You look happy.

723
00:42:51,248 --> 00:42:52,294
Sorry to bother you.

724
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,075
I wanted to see the bar-code dance

725
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,111
Also, it's been a while since I've watched the bicycle race

726
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,626
Shioya is beautiful, isn't it?

727
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,107
I was just teasing at the night market

728
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,490
Alone?

729
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,130
being alone with a nice person

730
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:05,779
I think you've been very busy.

731
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,560
I don't want to hear about his wedding.

732
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:13,099
Of course, I wouldn't do anything

733
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:19,997
But Shoichi, gives you a splendid gift

734
00:43:31,688 --> 00:43:34,286
This must be a top-quality item

735
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:36,326
This is awesome.

736
00:43:36,529 --> 00:43:38,365
Mr. Shoichi said?

737
00:43:39,059 --> 00:43:40,466
He is concerned about your mood

738
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,830
he's quite an observant young man

739
00:43:46,065 --> 00:43:49,065
Papa should learn a lot from him.

740
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,115
Please give my regards and thanks to Mr. Shoichi

741
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,046
Come on, Nacchan, cheer up! It's been a while

742
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:57,458
Let's drink up,

743
00:43:58,187 --> 00:44:00,123
Get the keys

744
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:01,638
It's locker keys.

745
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,740
The whiskey is locked up, right?

746
00:44:03,268 --> 00:44:05,214
How did you know?

747
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:07,404
Yes, I'll take it out

748
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:10,771
You must be properly tired, right?

749
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:13,701
It was magnificent

750
00:44:13,726 --> 00:44:17,193
Many important people from the political world were there.

751
00:44:17,218 --> 00:44:19,275
Come on,Nacchan.

752
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,300
We've been fed up with just tea for a while now

753
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:27,646
We have a new Wife in this house

754
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:31,430
Tomika, you should be a little more careful with your words

755
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:32,708
Where's Taiko?

756
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:34,934
She just went out.

757
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:37,552
Kanako's place?

758
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:39,935
I'm sure something happened again.

759
00:44:40,006 --> 00:44:42,388
She came to talk about Shizu-san.

760
00:44:43,109 --> 00:44:44,995
They're such trivial people

761
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,020
I'm busy but I'm at home on weekends.

762
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,341
I'm going out too.

763
00:44:52,685 --> 00:44:53,638
Where are you going?

764
00:44:55,784 --> 00:44:57,474
We have a guest from Hong Kong.

765
00:44:57,742 --> 00:44:59,536
so I should at least serve a meal.

766
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,845
What's wrong? you are in a hurry

767
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,634
I was shopping at the supermarket

768
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:15,727
a strange noise right behind me

769
00:45:16,168 --> 00:45:17,259
What kind of guy?

770
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:19,197
He was in a dirty state.

771
00:45:20,704 --> 00:45:22,673
Your clothes are torn

772
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:24,993
I can't believe it.

773
00:45:25,763 --> 00:45:27,179
He is a pervert

774
00:45:27,775 --> 00:45:29,345
Be careful!

775
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:31,376
It would be good to report it to the police box later

776
00:45:32,994 --> 00:45:35,994
Ma'am,I'm popular with men

777
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:42,575
You are happy to have your skirt torn

778
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:45,990
but hurry up and change.

779
00:45:59,113 --> 00:46:02,113
Oh Papa

780
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:05,256
I thought you were a pervert.

781
00:46:05,832 --> 00:46:07,279
Isn't it rude to say that?

782
00:46:08,897 --> 00:46:10,203
It's been a while

783
00:46:10,461 --> 00:46:12,797
I was wondering what was going on with that

784
00:46:12,822 --> 00:46:15,258
You concern only the tea room?

785
00:46:15,283 --> 00:46:17,013
Don't say like that.

786
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,786
How is your life?

787
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:21,521
For what?

788
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,427
Your new wife

789
00:46:23,452 --> 00:46:24,928
That's not a big deal.

790
00:46:25,185 --> 00:46:26,334
That's not bad, is it?

791
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:28,169
Please don't tease me

792
00:46:28,194 --> 00:46:30,295
I don't do that.

793
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,596
You've lost a little weight and look very smart

794
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:37,620
I lost 7 pounds

795
00:46:37,645 --> 00:46:41,005
 pounds?
It's the same as when your wife uses

796
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:43,146
She is the daughter of the Koshiba Butter family

797
00:46:43,194 --> 00:46:45,645
I have always been British in everything

798
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:46,950
This isn't something that just started now.

799
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:50,038
Oh, it's true that women like us in UK?

800
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:52,615
This garden is very beautiful.

801
00:46:53,052 --> 00:46:54,798
Please tell me the truth.

802
00:46:56,072 --> 00:46:58,263
Please bring me a cold drink.

803
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,779
What is the reason for losing weight?

804
00:47:02,804 --> 00:47:06,552
Our company has been in a mess, you know

805
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:08,997
Is that all?

806
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:10,443
What do you mean?

807
00:47:10,468 --> 00:47:12,325
I think you know that

808
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,974
Because of Taiko?

809
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,786
Even if I say I'm newlywed,

810
00:47:18,137 --> 00:47:19,654
I have grandchildren

811
00:47:19,826 --> 00:47:21,388
You think so?

812
00:47:21,794 --> 00:47:23,333
That's enough.

813
00:47:23,817 --> 00:47:25,793
I thought I might have a whiskey,

814
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:27,746
but I've already had one long ago

815
00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:29,036
There's no one to drink with,

816
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:32,155
so I can't afford to be extravagant

817
00:47:32,188 --> 00:47:34,404
I send you money every month.

818
00:47:34,431 --> 00:47:37,841
Yes but I've been keeping it aside

819
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:39,107
What do you mean?

820
00:47:40,078 --> 00:47:42,086
I leave the check as it is.

821
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:48,539
Are you leaving now?

822
00:47:49,975 --> 00:47:53,250
I think I'll change into my yukata.

823
00:47:53,275 --> 00:47:54,801
I already took it to the cleaners

824
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,276
It's fine with yours

825
00:47:56,305 --> 00:47:58,118
Welcome back.

826
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:00,065
How are you?

827
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:02,257
Is that all there is?

828
00:48:02,617 --> 00:48:04,969
I bought something at the bargain sale,

829
00:48:05,023 --> 00:48:06,000
is that strange?

830
00:48:06,598 --> 00:48:09,750
I think that would be very sexy for him

831
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,625
It's good for my eyes.

832
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:14,719
What are you talking about?

833
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:19,133
She's a huge difference from us.

834
00:48:19,774 --> 00:48:22,391
You are very eloquent.

835
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:25,109
It's true

836
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:29,160
There are always problems in my house

837
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:34,340
I'm going to take a look at another house.

838
00:48:35,378 --> 00:48:36,210
Come with me.

839
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:38,180
What do you mean? It's ridiculous.

840
00:48:38,766 --> 00:48:40,328
it’s fine to be noisy about it

841
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,476
You came all this way,

842
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:42,797
We can't

843
00:48:43,103 --> 00:48:46,103
You think there is frustration

844
00:48:46,461 --> 00:48:47,938
Women and men are different

845
00:48:47,963 --> 00:48:51,562
Let's go out together

846
00:48:51,743 --> 00:48:52,953
We can't

847
00:48:52,978 --> 00:48:53,867
You're being too rigid

848
00:48:54,622 --> 00:48:56,219
This is our secret

849
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:58,797
We can't

850
00:49:03,086 --> 00:49:04,344
Do you need anything from me?

851
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:09,422
I'm going to that laundromat
to get Yukata

852
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,320
It's fine today

853
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:14,267
I heard Papa is busy, so he'll be back soon

854
00:49:15,024 --> 00:49:15,688
Natsuko

855
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:18,255
Shall we get some eel?

856
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,716
You shouldn't eat such things

857
00:49:21,027 --> 00:49:22,538
I want to take a little nap

858
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,109
He is tired so please give him a massage.

859
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,538
It's a man.

860
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:32,265
A man?  I don't need a male masseuse.

861
00:49:38,890 --> 00:49:41,031
I don't understand where you guys are focusing your attention

862
00:49:41,922 --> 00:49:45,554
If you don't entertain to the bar,

863
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,256
We can't deal.

864
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:49,367
You can't have such old-fashioned ideas.

865
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:55,070
We should deal honestly with others

866
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:57,601
Ok?

867
00:49:58,249 --> 00:49:59,000
That's enough.

868
00:50:01,485 --> 00:50:02,368
What's wrong?

869
00:50:02,601 --> 00:50:03,828
I have business in Muroran

870
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,094
is it a business trip?

871
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,398
When are you going?

872
00:50:07,423 --> 00:50:08,578
It's the evening flight

873
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:12,781
Shall we stop by Sapporo on our way back?

874
00:50:13,747 --> 00:50:16,747
It's been a month, and it's about time you returned

875
00:50:18,350 --> 00:50:21,350
Dad, something happened, didn't it?

876
00:50:23,619 --> 00:50:28,601
Actually,it seems that Taiko has been getting involved with Natsuko

877
00:50:29,438 --> 00:50:31,164
Do you know that maid?

878
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:32,648
Oharu?

879
00:50:34,308 --> 00:50:37,648
Tomiko said she heard the information from the driver.

880
00:50:38,062 --> 00:50:39,906
Please be careful of her.

881
00:50:40,783 --> 00:50:41,820
We both have our struggles.

882
00:50:42,157 --> 00:50:43,680
You and I are different.

883
00:50:45,493 --> 00:50:46,336
Thank you very much.

884
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,406
Could you go for me?

885
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,731
Don't worry about money

886
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:52,101
I'm going now

887
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:53,789
I'm counting on you.

888
00:50:56,619 --> 00:50:58,250
He's it's too much for me.

889
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:05,070
He is very educated

890
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:07,570
It's me.

891
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:09,351
What are my plans for tonight?

892
00:51:09,961 --> 00:51:11,797
Nothing today

893
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:12,852
I get it.

894
00:51:18,649 --> 00:51:19,883
Yes.

895
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:23,515
Is that husband?

896
00:51:24,422 --> 00:51:26,086
your wife?

897
00:51:27,026 --> 00:51:29,822
She just left a little while ago.

898
00:51:30,456 --> 00:51:31,711
Without mentioning the destination

899
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,570
She seemed to be in quite a hurry.

900
00:51:36,958 --> 00:51:38,656
Was she calling a man or a woman?

901
00:51:39,231 --> 00:51:39,831
You don't know?

902
00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:42,746
Check it out.

903
00:51:42,771 --> 00:51:44,035
I'll call you later.

904
00:51:46,356 --> 00:51:48,390
She's useless

905
00:52:13,514 --> 00:52:14,728
Come in.

906
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:17,544
Excuse me

907
00:52:20,966 --> 00:52:22,496
Clean up after the boss leaves.

908
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:24,945
It's ok.

909
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,142
Leave it

910
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:29,342
Who's her?

911
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,880
She's a part-time job worker

912
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:36,449
This is truly modern

913
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,920
Let her keep working.

914
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,476
It's not really a bother, so don't worry

915
00:52:41,506 --> 00:52:42,572
Well then.

916
00:53:06,418 --> 00:53:08,012
That job is dangerous.

917
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:11,176
If you slip, you'll be dead

918
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,186
I have to do what others won't do

919
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,876
I'm a student at a PE university.

920
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:16,326
I'm used to it

921
00:53:16,407 --> 00:53:17,333
PE?

922
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:23,190
Are you able to open your legs and put your head on the floor?

923
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,422
It's easy.

924
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,659
I can do even more amazing things

925
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,656
Well then, I'd like to see it once

926
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:31,933
Feel free to anytime

927
00:53:32,197 --> 00:53:34,097
Shall we have a meal together?

928
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:35,708
I'm starving.

929
00:53:38,105 --> 00:53:39,871
You're so honest.

930
00:53:56,097 --> 00:53:57,771
Welcome.

931
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,115
I've prepared the usual room,

932
00:54:01,189 --> 00:54:02,965
but I wonder if I couldn't accommodate four people?

933
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,760
 It's just two

934
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:07,010
Weren't you together?

935
00:54:07,383 --> 00:54:09,130
What do you mean?

936
00:54:09,716 --> 00:54:11,965
Are you getting with the lady from Kamakura?

937
00:54:12,193 --> 00:54:14,393
Is she here?

938
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,409
Just a moment ago

939
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:17,783
This is not good idea.

940
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,475
I'll come again.

941
00:54:19,559 --> 00:54:20,763
It's ok.

942
00:54:20,788 --> 00:54:23,788
It's not good for me.

943
00:54:30,349 --> 00:54:33,349
and it's a bit unpleasant, so well then!

944
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:42,786
As I hear a lot here at Okawabata,

945
00:54:42,962 --> 00:54:44,338
it seems like I've forgotten about the unpleasant stories,

946
00:54:45,356 --> 00:54:46,720
but it can't be helped

947
00:54:48,093 --> 00:54:49,663
It's a bit tough, isn't it?

948
00:54:51,186 --> 00:54:53,049
Please feel free to speak up

949
00:54:54,026 --> 00:54:57,203
I have made up my mind properly during the call earlier.

950
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,157
Are you sure?

951
00:55:00,503 --> 00:55:01,710
Please pour

952
00:55:07,499 --> 00:55:08,564
How about you?

953
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,799
You are like someone who has been to a hot spring at all,

954
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:27,097
You don't look like one either.

955
00:55:28,797 --> 00:55:30,696
I’m Kanako, born in Canada, and I don’t have to introduce myself that way

956
00:55:31,096 --> 00:55:32,871
But you do know, don’t you?

957
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:38,950
Well then, let's get straight to the point

958
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:40,922
Go ahead.

959
00:55:42,127 --> 00:55:47,986
Actually, you see, Taeko-san knew about you then she returned to Hokkaido.

960
00:55:49,983 --> 00:55:53,392
I suppose some meddlesome person
must have informed her out of loyalty

961
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:56,949
The responsibility that directly connects Taiko-san and my brother

962
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:00,569
I have to tell you

963
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:02,800
Are you saying we should break up?

964
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,226
You're right;

965
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:10,200
a life like this won't last in the end.

966
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,048
I really think it's better to have a proper marriage

967
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,534
If it were you, I'm sure you'd have plenty of chances

968
00:56:17,990 --> 00:56:19,086
If that's the case,

969
00:56:19,110 --> 00:56:20,517
Do you want me to take care of it?

970
00:56:21,488 --> 00:56:23,474
But I am Geisha girl.

971
00:56:24,169 --> 00:56:25,865
You can handle it down there

972
00:56:27,734 --> 00:56:28,927
I wonder if I was praised for something?

973
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:29,832
Of course,

974
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,216
it's unfortunate

975
00:56:33,466 --> 00:56:35,454
I'm no good

976
00:56:36,723 --> 00:56:42,642
I can if Papa allows me to, but being pressured like this by those around me only complicates my feelings

977
00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:47,300
Besides, I really like Papa.

978
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,531
Oh I see

979
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:53,110
But what’s so good about such an old man?

980
00:56:53,135 --> 00:56:55,724
He is twice your age, isn't he?

981
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:58,949
I'm not that different from Taiko

982
00:56:59,786 --> 00:57:02,396
She does not care of his age?

983
00:57:03,135 --> 00:57:04,346
I see.

984
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:07,227
That's interesting

985
00:57:08,013 --> 00:57:09,416
Thank you very much

986
00:57:10,590 --> 00:57:14,498
But please don't bully me too much.

987
00:57:14,914 --> 00:57:16,621
I like you now.

988
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:20,778
Don't make such a scary face?

989
00:57:20,803 --> 00:57:22,698
Please shake my hand.

990
00:57:29,443 --> 00:57:30,789
Your hands are cold.

991
00:57:38,589 --> 00:57:39,676
I feel good...

992
00:57:39,969 --> 00:57:41,788
She's a strategist.

993
00:57:41,986 --> 00:57:43,952
Yes She is

994
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,406
Be careful,

995
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,575
Have some drink?

996
00:57:47,682 --> 00:57:48,420
Thank you

997
00:57:53,897 --> 00:57:54,971
Where's the husband?

998
00:57:55,111 --> 00:57:56,764
We are in trouble.

999
00:57:57,127 --> 00:57:59,723
The person over there had a miscarriage, and I was able to accompany her after all

1000
00:57:59,748 --> 00:58:01,404
Was she pregnant?

1001
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:04,429
Yeah. Men are just doing things behind the scenes.

1002
00:58:05,405 --> 00:58:07,427
He hate wife and He ended up like this,

1003
00:58:08,232 --> 00:58:09,620
You see?

1004
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,775
Don't you know what Papa is doing outside?

1005
00:58:12,983 --> 00:58:14,256
If I keep singing about it,

1006
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:15,894
I'll just get more wrinkles

1007
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,273
It's true that women are like that,

1008
00:58:18,298 --> 00:58:19,071
Yeah.

1009
00:58:43,173 --> 00:58:44,789
Are you okay?

1010
00:58:45,033 --> 00:58:48,000
I don't get tired easily from things like this

1011
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,490
You're looking cool

1012
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:53,547
That's something to celebrate!

1013
00:58:53,714 --> 00:58:55,160
What's the hell?

1014
00:58:57,857 --> 00:58:59,570
I'm tired.

1015
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:09,180
Stay with me tonight.

1016
00:59:09,257 --> 00:59:10,490
You may get collapse

1017
00:59:10,709 --> 00:59:12,055
I don't mind

1018
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,088
Then let's go all out

1019
00:59:22,787 --> 00:59:24,118
How about this?

1020
00:59:24,298 --> 00:59:25,585
It suits you.

1021
00:59:27,183 --> 00:59:30,183
This is good for you.

1022
00:59:30,343 --> 00:59:31,609
But it's expensive, isn't it?

1023
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:32,413
Can this really sell?

1024
00:59:32,437 --> 00:59:35,192
It's still cheaper than buying at a local store,

1025
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:39,785
but it's a good business idea you've come up with

1026
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,726
This person is in charge of procurement

1027
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:42,376
while I handle sales

1028
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,216
If I just dress nice, they'll buy.

1029
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,436
If that's the case, I guess I have to buy something too

1030
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:51,321
Thank you for your cooperation for our wedding.

1031
00:59:55,004 --> 00:59:58,004
Hello.

1032
00:59:58,895 --> 00:59:59,795
Who?

1033
01:00:00,101 --> 01:00:01,088
Excuse me.

1034
01:00:06,005 --> 01:00:06,759
Hello.

1035
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:08,100
is there something you need?

1036
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:09,347
Are you wife?

1037
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:10,133
Yes.

1038
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:12,728
could you let me clean the windows?

1039
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:15,332
Do you clean window?

1040
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:15,796
Yes.

1041
01:00:16,442 --> 01:00:17,902
Are you a part-timer?

1042
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:19,050
 Yes, that's right

1043
01:00:19,806 --> 01:00:21,452
But there are only a few windows, and my family can clean them,

1044
01:00:21,703 --> 01:00:22,958
so it's fine

1045
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,926
Please don't say that, let me wipe it off

1046
01:00:26,009 --> 01:00:27,235
in that outfit?

1047
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:29,248
I'll change into work cloth.

1048
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:38,327
Papa.

1049
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:40,262
Papa?

1050
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:44,801
Papa.

1051
01:00:47,715 --> 01:00:48,449
Hello?

1052
01:00:48,549 --> 01:00:49,282
Oh you.

1053
01:00:49,909 --> 01:00:51,791
It would be bad if these guys found out

1054
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:53,525
I won't make such a mistake.

1055
01:00:53,642 --> 01:00:55,321
I came here to avoid being found

1056
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:58,806
I came up the back stairs,

1057
01:01:00,061 --> 01:01:01,744
Hey, just wait in the apartment.

1058
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,900
No way, I can't let Natsuko-san win

1059
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,266
Did you meet her?

1060
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:09,556
I just went there.

1061
01:01:09,581 --> 01:01:10,987
She was very nice.

1062
01:01:11,307 --> 01:01:12,353
But I'm a little jealous

1063
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:12,979
What?

1064
01:01:13,157 --> 01:01:14,408
Kamiyama Natsuko.

1065
01:01:14,939 --> 01:01:17,486
Natsuko-san really love you.

1066
01:01:17,643 --> 01:01:18,158
Yes.

1067
01:01:18,454 --> 01:01:20,833
You are acting like nice.

1068
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:24,188
But you are really popular

1069
01:01:24,716 --> 01:01:26,166
Do you like me?

1070
01:01:26,494 --> 01:01:27,057
Yes.

1071
01:01:27,315 --> 01:01:28,221
Same here.

1072
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:30,845
Since I started liking you

1073
01:01:30,870 --> 01:01:31,970
I haven't been able to notice any other men at all

1074
01:01:31,995 --> 01:01:35,142
But younger people probably prefer younger men

1075
01:01:35,167 --> 01:01:38,595
The other day I was hit on, but I turned him down

1076
01:01:41,410 --> 01:01:42,705
How many girls do you have?

1077
01:01:43,661 --> 01:01:44,955
Don't say bullshit.

1078
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:48,595
But there is no limit to the number of girls, right?

1079
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:50,189
You say some interesting things.

1080
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:54,110
I intend not to lose to Natsuko-san

1081
01:01:54,557 --> 01:01:56,276
But I feel sorry for her.

1082
01:01:56,401 --> 01:01:56,752
Why?

1083
01:01:57,658 --> 01:01:58,849
There's really no freedom.

1084
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,424
She is not recognized as an individual

1085
01:02:01,572 --> 01:02:03,416
She has a lot of freedom.

1086
01:02:03,712 --> 01:02:07,142
She seems to be in a cage

1087
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:09,283
You think so?

1088
01:02:09,728 --> 01:02:11,556
I also want a house.

1089
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:18,142
But at that time, it is still my house, which means my personality dominate every corner of the room.

1090
01:02:18,758 --> 01:02:21,634
Natsuko's house is all about what you want, after all

1091
01:02:21,751 --> 01:02:24,751
In my case, You will be treated as a guest

1092
01:02:25,057 --> 01:02:26,291
You did something bad.

1093
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,396
It's okay

1094
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:30,420
They haven't noticed anything

1095
01:02:30,924 --> 01:02:32,190
Look.

1096
01:02:36,010 --> 01:02:39,010
Hello,it's me.

1097
01:02:40,276 --> 01:02:40,744
What?

1098
01:02:41,131 --> 01:02:44,963
There's a problem.
When Taeko returned from Hokkaido

1099
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:47,720
She collapse on her way back from Hokkaido

1100
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:50,791
What collapsed? What's happening?

1101
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:52,502
You don't know?

1102
01:02:52,892 --> 01:02:55,088
Shoichi is accompanying her?

1103
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:58,066
Alright, then I'll head to the hospital right away;

1104
01:02:58,090 --> 01:02:58,963
this is serious

1105
01:02:59,244 --> 01:03:00,026
It's boring.

1106
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,065
What?

1107
01:03:01,674 --> 01:03:02,315
I can't stay with you tonight.

1108
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:04,098
I don't know how she is

1109
01:03:05,205 --> 01:03:08,205
I might not be able to join you again.

1110
01:03:08,258 --> 01:03:09,565
You're asking for too much again

1111
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:10,705
Then kiss me

1112
01:03:10,934 --> 01:03:13,934
Can I do a silly American movie imitation ?

1113
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:17,440
It can't be helped.

1114
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:20,665
Hello?

1115
01:03:21,210 --> 01:03:22,236
Oh Shoichi.

1116
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:23,869
What's going on?

1117
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:27,079
She appears to be pregnant

1118
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:29,275
She made a baby.

1119
01:03:30,447 --> 01:03:32,502
So you guys
have had another baby,

1120
01:03:32,527 --> 01:03:33,353
that's wonderful!

1121
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:35,384
How's Taiko now?

1122
01:03:35,476 --> 01:03:36,882
You're in the hospital now, right?

1123
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,180
That Ms Taeko and you have had a baby

1124
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:43,737
Are you sure?

1125
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:46,688
Yes, it's true.
Congratulations.

1126
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,306
Can you come here right away?

1127
01:03:51,674 --> 01:03:53,541
Oh no..my baby.

1128
01:03:59,422 --> 01:04:02,422
Kiss me,papa

1129
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,377
Isn't everyone coming?
Oh my god.

1130
01:04:06,565 --> 01:04:07,861
Hide here.

1131
01:04:11,979 --> 01:04:13,221
Come in.

1132
01:04:18,998 --> 01:04:20,431
I don't have any plans for today?

1133
01:04:20,713 --> 01:04:22,057
at least not at the moment

1134
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,806
I'm going out for a bit now

1135
01:04:25,465 --> 01:04:27,845
Well then, that's fine

1136
01:04:29,315 --> 01:04:31,291
Get the car.

1137
01:04:44,998 --> 01:04:47,998
I heard from Shoichi.

1138
01:04:48,974 --> 01:04:51,111
I was worried because you
didn't come back for a long time

1139
01:04:52,550 --> 01:04:54,086
Well, I'm glad about that

1140
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,955
So, is it all settled

1141
01:04:57,338 --> 01:04:59,213
Can I have a baby?

1142
01:05:00,197 --> 01:05:00,970
What?

1143
01:05:02,659 --> 01:05:05,659
I will give birth if you want.

1144
01:05:06,046 --> 01:05:10,306
Now that we have a child, I hope you will take care of her.

1145
01:05:10,447 --> 01:05:11,104
Her?

1146
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:14,041
What do you mean?

1147
01:05:14,838 --> 01:05:16,627
You are pretending not to understand

1148
01:05:17,391 --> 01:05:18,390
Of course, I'm talking about Natsuko Kamioka,

1149
01:05:21,730 --> 01:05:24,436
You will break up with me, won't you?

1150
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:27,461
At this point, I would like a clear answer,

1151
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,416
You give vague responses

1152
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:33,546
We're breaking up

1153
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:35,476
You really promise me, don't you?

1154
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:39,330
You shouldn't think that I'm saying this

1155
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:41,424
the baby in my belly is saying something.

1156
01:05:41,994 --> 01:05:47,697
I don't want my kids to say they have two moms.

1157
01:05:48,488 --> 01:05:51,488
But you really do take responsibility, don't you?

1158
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:55,360
But do you really have a bay?

1159
01:05:55,892 --> 01:05:58,608
go ahead and touch it

1160
01:05:58,733 --> 01:06:01,733
I can tell just from being stabbed from above?

1161
01:06:01,822 --> 01:06:03,557
Just touch it.

1162
01:06:09,729 --> 01:06:10,799
I’m sorry.

1163
01:06:11,310 --> 01:06:13,496
You had an appendicitis operation.

1164
01:06:13,521 --> 01:06:16,521
I'm glad, congratulations!

1165
01:06:23,096 --> 01:06:24,799
Take it off.

1166
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,674
But that's not good

1167
01:06:30,284 --> 01:06:32,330
Why are you teasing me?

1168
01:06:32,526 --> 01:06:36,291
You are impatient and always does whatever you want

1169
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,314
There's no mood.

1170
01:06:38,627 --> 01:06:39,822
Because I'm young.

1171
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:41,697
Damn it.

1172
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:52,884
I don't even have enough money to surround myself with a deluxe apartment

1173
01:06:54,299 --> 01:06:56,104
Just keep it up.

1174
01:06:57,220 --> 01:07:00,220
When I get to be as old as Sakuma?

1175
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,658
I'll refuse it

1176
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:06,740
Even if I keep you

1177
01:07:07,170 --> 01:07:10,447
A young man like me is not good enough for you

1178
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:17,822
Hey, I don't like that old man's photo,

1179
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:24,463
Come on.

1180
01:07:29,455 --> 01:07:30,354
Come on.

1181
01:07:51,572 --> 01:07:52,463
Who?

1182
01:07:52,744 --> 01:07:53,690
That old man?

1183
01:07:55,502 --> 01:07:56,799
Hide yourself.

1184
01:07:57,168 --> 01:07:58,580
Where to hide?

1185
01:07:58,605 --> 01:08:02,830
Under the bed.
I'll cleverly take him outside.

1186
01:08:09,372 --> 01:08:12,372
The old man's photo

1187
01:08:14,635 --> 01:08:15,471
Yes.

1188
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:17,268
Hide yourself.

1189
01:08:17,527 --> 01:08:18,619
It's cold,

1190
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:34,119
Did I surprise you?

1191
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,666
Mind if I come in for a bit?

1192
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:38,026
Please.

1193
01:08:57,104 --> 01:08:58,658
How did you know here?

1194
01:09:00,963 --> 01:09:03,580
You dropped this, didn't you?

1195
01:09:05,356 --> 01:09:07,392
I searched for it quite a while.
Oh you got it.

1196
01:09:07,509 --> 01:09:10,455
I was thinking of delivering it right away,

1197
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,299
but I thought you might pick this up.

1198
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:13,939
so I'm sorry for the trouble

1199
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:17,720
There is something I want to ask you before I return it.

1200
01:09:18,455 --> 01:09:19,401
What is it?

1201
01:09:19,975 --> 01:09:22,871
You see, I happened to look inside this

1202
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,252
Then this came out.

1203
01:09:26,565 --> 01:09:28,354
You knew about Sakuma, didn't you?

1204
01:09:31,733 --> 01:09:37,758
Seeing where Sakuma's belongings are, it seems
like you might not just be acquaintances

1205
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:41,100
If I misunderstood, please forgive me

1206
01:09:41,570 --> 01:09:44,570
Since when have you been involved with Sakuma?

1207
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,197
If you stay silent, I won't understand

1208
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:56,877
But You have a future together, so you shouldn't be with Sakuma.

1209
01:09:57,880 --> 01:10:00,880
Do you really love him,

1210
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:04,456
Do you truly love Sakuma?

1211
01:10:07,666 --> 01:10:08,726
What about you?

1212
01:10:09,766 --> 01:10:11,432
Well,I don't dislike him.

1213
01:10:12,063 --> 01:10:12,936
That's about it?

1214
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:13,836
Yes.

1215
01:10:14,653 --> 01:10:17,029
But I might come to like it even more from now on

1216
01:10:20,329 --> 01:10:22,402
Please don't worry about it.
It's a cat, you know

1217
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,682
Sakuma didn't know animals at all

1218
01:10:24,726 --> 01:10:26,719
I didn't know.

1219
01:10:27,969 --> 01:10:31,262
You only understand that much about that person, huh?

1220
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:33,026
Do you know more?

1221
01:10:34,026 --> 01:10:35,617
It's been 5 years now

1222
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,771
The passage of time isn't the issue

1223
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:44,146
You know, I'm much younger than you, but I'm a good people watcher.

1224
01:10:46,106 --> 01:10:49,106
I also researched Sakuma in a short period of time.

1225
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,656
So this is the result of that research;

1226
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:55,320
he is the most typical Japanese man, isn't he?

1227
01:10:55,683 --> 01:10:57,989
He has an exceptionally strong desire for business,

1228
01:10:58,413 --> 01:10:59,899
He has ulterior motives for women.

1229
01:11:00,550 --> 01:11:02,170
I'm strong against that kind of person

1230
01:11:02,970 --> 01:11:07,283
I want to get a lot of money from men who play around with women.

1231
01:11:08,861 --> 01:11:10,297
Even you know that?

1232
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:14,220
You don't really love that old man
from the bottom of your heart

1233
01:11:14,502 --> 01:11:15,635
Tell me.

1234
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:18,939
I'm different.

1235
01:11:20,619 --> 01:11:21,346
so that's love?

1236
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:23,197
Yes.

1237
01:11:27,197 --> 01:11:28,244
Is it strange?

1238
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:29,616
It's comedy

1239
01:11:30,484 --> 01:11:31,509
It's old.

1240
01:11:31,802 --> 01:11:34,752
old, old, old? Is it bad?

1241
01:11:34,955 --> 01:11:35,612
Shouldn't it be miserable?

1242
01:11:36,031 --> 01:11:39,806
Is there really a need to love for someone you
can't even officially marry?

1243
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:43,134
Let's work together.

1244
01:11:43,728 --> 01:11:46,728
We'll just work together to get money from him.

1245
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:50,535
After that, we'll just marry the person
we like the most

1246
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:51,283
How about that?

1247
01:11:53,387 --> 01:11:54,683
you're angry?

1248
01:11:55,176 --> 01:11:57,822
It seems I don't need to listen to you any longer

1249
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:00,623
You are innocent and simple

1250
01:12:00,868 --> 01:12:03,040
But you might lose your mistress job.

1251
01:12:05,158 --> 01:12:07,174
I heard that a child is going to be born at his home

1252
01:12:11,268 --> 01:12:12,776
You didn't know that?

1253
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,296
He is currently with his wife,

1254
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,466
and he was not able to come back here

1255
01:12:21,491 --> 01:12:23,440
Let him play properly,Mrs. Natsuko

1256
01:12:52,588 --> 01:12:53,604
Saeko

1257
01:13:13,057 --> 01:13:14,322
What's wrong?

1258
01:13:14,347 --> 01:13:17,072
Mom and the Master argue about his wife

1259
01:13:17,572 --> 01:13:19,666
Master got angry and said he was going to break up with Mama

1260
01:13:20,112 --> 01:13:21,526
She took the fruit knife

1261
01:13:21,710 --> 01:13:22,463
Did she stab him with a fruit knife?

1262
01:13:23,729 --> 01:13:24,900
what happened to the master?

1263
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:26,548
he was a carried by ambulance

1264
01:13:26,838 --> 01:13:28,033
he's serious case

1265
01:13:31,930 --> 01:13:34,930
Mom called 110 herself right away

1266
01:13:37,947 --> 01:13:39,432
Oh Saeko.

1267
01:13:50,965 --> 01:13:53,965
Thank you for your hard work

1268
01:13:57,322 --> 01:13:58,487
Oh Nacchan.

1269
01:14:02,259 --> 01:14:04,970
What's wrong with a pale face?

1270
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Ah, wait a moment, I have work to do soon

1271
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:15,744
I'm thinking that if a reasonably priced apartment comes up, I might consider it

1272
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:17,978
It's a waste to do live alone

1273
01:14:19,010 --> 01:14:20,046
But I'm sorry

1274
01:14:20,070 --> 01:14:22,236
You came all this way for me

1275
01:14:22,823 --> 01:14:25,823
I don't want anything other than this.

1276
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:27,923
Are you okay to drink so much?

1277
01:14:30,576 --> 01:14:31,759
I'm very used to it

1278
01:14:32,657 --> 01:14:34,525
You should drink too, teacher

1279
01:14:34,550 --> 01:14:36,160
I can't drink.

1280
01:14:38,703 --> 01:14:41,703
I can't help but drink tonight

1281
01:14:42,724 --> 01:14:45,724
where you said Saeko?

1282
01:14:48,762 --> 01:14:51,762
I never thought she would do something like that.

1283
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:57,853
When the time comes, women don't know what to do.

1284
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,244
You same?

1285
01:14:59,830 --> 01:15:02,181
I am also a woman.

1286
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:03,820
That's scary

1287
01:15:05,582 --> 01:15:06,995
I feel bad.

1288
01:15:07,480 --> 01:15:08,986
Can I untie?

1289
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,246
Go ahead.

1290
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:11,236
take it easy

1291
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:13,155
Excuse me.

1292
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:18,800
Are you alright?

1293
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:36,926
Teacher.

1294
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:43,530
You said when we met the other
day that I looked happy.

1295
01:15:46,062 --> 01:15:47,516
Do you really think so?

1296
01:15:48,301 --> 01:15:48,861
Yeah.

1297
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:53,612
Well, I tell you a nice story

1298
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:56,082
About My New Year's Day

1299
01:15:57,071 --> 01:15:58,318
About your New Year's Day?

1300
01:15:58,728 --> 01:16:01,728
That's Natsuko's New Year's Day

1301
01:16:04,520 --> 01:16:06,823
I wake up alone on New Year's Day

1302
01:16:08,423 --> 01:16:10,376
My partner is a maid.

1303
01:16:13,093 --> 01:16:15,297
When that maid goes out to play,

1304
01:16:16,233 --> 01:16:19,233
I will be all alone in the house

1305
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:23,240
Of course, I don't want to see people coming for New Year's greetings either

1306
01:16:24,076 --> 01:16:27,914
A cheerful shopkeeper at the vegetable store don't come.

1307
01:16:30,014 --> 01:16:34,419
Neighborhood kids are surrounded by their parents,

1308
01:16:34,970 --> 01:16:37,970
squealing and playing with kites and flying kite.

1309
01:16:39,026 --> 01:16:42,026
Sometimes I have trouble dealing with drunken customers

1310
01:16:43,610 --> 01:16:44,990
But you know, teacher

1311
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:49,230
Am I just sitting quietly at home?

1312
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,821
Even so, I'm happy?

1313
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:03,225
I eat freshly cooked rice facing my husband and his wife.

1314
01:17:04,357 --> 01:17:10,458
I am the wife And you are my husband

1315
01:17:11,966 --> 01:17:14,205
I often have such dreams like this.

1316
01:17:15,370 --> 01:17:16,940
If it's a dream, that's fine

1317
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:19,344
Can't that be true?

1318
01:17:20,403 --> 01:17:22,158
Why not?

1319
01:17:26,275 --> 01:17:27,341
You see?

1320
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:29,306
Just look

1321
01:17:31,515 --> 01:17:33,522
Can you endure this room for three days?

1322
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:36,169
I'll clean it and make it nice

1323
01:17:36,428 --> 01:17:38,274
I can do that.

1324
01:17:38,746 --> 01:17:43,926
Do you think you can live on my meager salary after getting used to a luxurious lifestyle?

1325
01:17:45,516 --> 01:17:49,044
Even buying one side dish for dinner requires consulting my wallet every time

1326
01:17:49,130 --> 01:17:55,073
I am prepared. What I want now is a love.

1327
01:17:55,316 --> 01:18:00,383
while living a poor life, The love might fade away

1328
01:18:02,013 --> 01:18:04,062
If love disappears, that would truly be miserable

1329
01:18:06,813 --> 01:18:09,813
I don't want you to go through that kind of experience now

1330
01:18:10,580 --> 01:18:12,846
You don't like me, do you?

1331
01:18:13,086 --> 01:18:16,995
You don't like a woman like me,right?

1332
01:18:17,342 --> 01:18:18,495
That's not true.

1333
01:18:19,286 --> 01:18:23,354
I really don't have the confidence to make you happy.

1334
01:18:23,953 --> 01:18:26,291
Saying something so spineless

1335
01:18:27,650 --> 01:18:29,661
You were strong.

1336
01:18:31,226 --> 01:18:33,508
Be my teacher again like in the old days

1337
01:18:34,706 --> 01:18:35,806
Teacher.

1338
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:43,694
Give me courage

1339
01:18:44,871 --> 01:18:47,171
I can't live like this anymore.

1340
01:19:09,740 --> 01:19:11,646
I don't want to go home tonight.

1341
01:19:11,689 --> 01:19:15,561
But until you have clearly received permission from Sakuma.

1342
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:19,313
we are both adults

1343
01:19:22,389 --> 01:19:26,878
It's okay to stay like this? Please hold me tight

1344
01:19:52,366 --> 01:19:53,399
Welcome back.

1345
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,782
He came last night.

1346
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:05,710
I told him you were at Lunar's mom's place.

1347
01:20:51,196 --> 01:20:52,516
Where were you?

1348
01:21:00,573 --> 01:21:01,916
Who were you with?

1349
01:21:14,197 --> 01:21:15,010
Say something.

1350
01:21:16,482 --> 01:21:18,424
So you were with Lunar's mom?

1351
01:21:18,470 --> 01:21:19,733
Don't lie about that,

1352
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,249
just look at this

1353
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:31,600
Natsuko, is it okay to lie.

1354
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:34,889
Who were you with?

1355
01:21:38,330 --> 01:21:40,248
I visited Mr.Kubo.

1356
01:21:41,009 --> 01:21:43,575
So you came back in the morning?

1357
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:45,436
is he your first love man?

1358
01:21:46,490 --> 01:21:49,115
Are you trying to make me jealous by cheating?

1359
01:21:49,811 --> 01:21:51,006
you are so dirty.

1360
01:21:51,357 --> 01:21:52,912
Don't get me wrong.

1361
01:21:53,308 --> 01:21:57,145
It's ridiculous to say that a man and a woman can share a room and nothing happened

1362
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:58,404
it was nothing happen

1363
01:21:58,755 --> 01:22:00,615
I'm sure you're lying.

1364
01:22:08,306 --> 01:22:09,395
Call Kubo

1365
01:22:10,255 --> 01:22:11,114
I meet him

1366
01:22:11,758 --> 01:22:14,434
what if you meet him?

1367
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:17,956
you will be with him too

1368
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,044
We'll discuss it among the three of us and come to a conclusion

1369
01:22:31,820 --> 01:22:35,646
Did you come home in the morning again?

1370
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:42,720
Ms. Taeko is going back to Hokkaido again

1371
01:22:46,590 --> 01:22:47,166
But, big brother,

1372
01:22:47,190 --> 01:22:49,232
Do you like Natsuko that much?

1373
01:22:49,978 --> 01:22:54,278
Is it hard for you to break up with her?

1374
01:22:57,055 --> 01:23:01,738
At this age, I still can't grasp the feelings of men.

1375
01:23:05,267 --> 01:23:06,509
Kawashima is here.

1376
01:23:07,110 --> 01:23:08,180
Get her throgh

1377
01:23:10,274 --> 01:23:11,774
Do you mind if you go home?

1378
01:23:13,398 --> 01:23:16,398
I will go home even if you don't tell me to

1379
01:23:17,570 --> 01:23:19,594
But let me make this clear:

1380
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:23,130
I am on Taeko's side until the very end

1381
01:23:24,009 --> 01:23:24,970
See?

1382
01:23:34,641 --> 01:23:35,524
How was she?

1383
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:39,618
I hear she will definitely visit.

1384
01:23:40,180 --> 01:23:42,686
I see, that's at a tiny repair shop

1385
01:23:42,710 --> 01:23:44,567
I heard he is a public servant there,

1386
01:23:44,796 --> 01:23:46,566
but what kind of man is he?

1387
01:23:46,998 --> 01:23:49,052
He had a good physique

1388
01:23:49,277 --> 01:23:51,075
He's quite a handsome guy, isn't he?

1389
01:23:55,296 --> 01:23:58,296
However, he doesn't really have much life skills, does he?

1390
01:23:59,960 --> 01:24:01,786
You also got in touch with Natsuko, didn't you?

1391
01:24:02,095 --> 01:24:03,095
Of course.

1392
01:24:13,270 --> 01:24:14,258
Ma'am.

1393
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:19,540
The car has arrived, but

1394
01:24:31,530 --> 01:24:34,530
it seems that a bad cold is trending this year

1395
01:24:36,210 --> 01:24:39,071
I'm glad to hear you are doing well.

1396
01:24:40,265 --> 01:24:42,641
thanks to that, he hasn't fallen ill at all

1397
01:24:43,990 --> 01:24:46,313
Your condition should be very good.

1398
01:24:48,280 --> 01:24:49,852
it is windy now

1399
01:24:52,680 --> 01:24:53,626
Wanna drink?

1400
01:25:02,012 --> 01:25:04,656
women don't keep time at all.

1401
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:10,625
Here it is.

1402
01:25:23,420 --> 01:25:24,536
You're late

1403
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:27,601
I’m sorry.

1404
01:25:34,165 --> 01:25:37,060
Natsuko. Come here and sit down.

1405
01:25:46,620 --> 01:25:51,287
Now that everyone is here, let's get to the questions

1406
01:25:52,742 --> 01:25:56,301
First, I'd like to hear Mr. Kubo's determination

1407
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,058
Speaking of determination?

1408
01:25:58,819 --> 01:26:03,250
I heard from her that you intend to marry Natsuko

1409
01:26:04,057 --> 01:26:04,623
Right?

1410
01:26:05,435 --> 01:26:07,051
Ask him.

1411
01:26:08,504 --> 01:26:09,184
Tell me.

1412
01:26:10,263 --> 01:26:11,936
Of course, I have those feelings.

1413
01:26:12,473 --> 01:26:13,369
That is not a lie

1414
01:26:14,703 --> 01:26:20,907
However, the one who must make up their mind is you, Natsuko

1415
01:26:23,765 --> 01:26:25,196
Will you come to my place?

1416
01:26:26,540 --> 01:26:29,540
Or will you stay at him?

1417
01:26:29,747 --> 01:26:31,599
That's up to Natsuko.

1418
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:34,381
But suppose

1419
01:26:36,114 --> 01:26:38,055
Natsuko chose you

1420
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,176
In that case,

1421
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:45,126
From my perspective, I have no choice but to treat you as
a thief for taking someone else's things without permission

1422
01:26:45,150 --> 01:26:46,116
Please wait a moment

1423
01:26:46,780 --> 01:26:49,780
You say it's someone else's, but humans are not objects

1424
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:51,547
Of course, that's right

1425
01:26:52,950 --> 01:26:57,399
However, I have cherished and protected Nasuko for five years

1426
01:26:58,270 --> 01:26:59,547
I would like you to consider that effort

1427
01:27:00,630 --> 01:27:02,608
Isn't she more important than material things

1428
01:27:03,550 --> 01:27:06,550
or even property?

1429
01:27:09,386 --> 01:27:11,322
I see women as property

1430
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:12,771
That's in the past

1431
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:19,646
Now that's not a problem even a child, or a grandchild,

1432
01:27:20,599 --> 01:27:23,388
They are treasures more important than any property.

1433
01:27:26,633 --> 01:27:29,633
If we seek peace in this world today,

1434
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:36,678
True peace among humans must be based on truth.

1435
01:27:39,450 --> 01:27:42,450
You came here to threaten this old man's peace

1436
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:46,530
Of course, you are free to love Natsuko,

1437
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:50,460
but you disrupted my room for that

1438
01:27:51,773 --> 01:27:53,453
Still, Are you okay with it?

1439
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:56,899
My words might be a bit harsh

1440
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:07,830
Seeing that there is no response, it seems
that Mr Kubo has understood my feelings.

1441
01:28:09,680 --> 01:28:11,679
Natsuko, what on earth is going on with you?

1442
01:28:13,720 --> 01:28:16,720
It seems you've underestimated me a bit too much

1443
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,712
Did you think I would allow you to marry him?

1444
01:28:21,469 --> 01:28:25,880
Did you think I would let it go in front of him?

1445
01:28:27,163 --> 01:28:29,278
 I realize now that I was indeed naive

1446
01:28:29,887 --> 01:28:30,664
Isn't that right?

1447
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:32,520
But don't get me wrong.

1448
01:28:33,865 --> 01:28:39,890
I had been relying too much on others.

1449
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,919
I have been living for a long time relying on others' help

1450
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:54,580
That habit became ingrained, and I couldn't do anything without relying on others.

1451
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:00,416
To say goodbye to you

1452
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:03,440
I felt that I needed Mr. Kubo's power

1453
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:11,610
But He only lent me half of his strength

1454
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:16,489
Teacher!

1455
01:29:17,422 --> 01:29:18,708
To be honest,

1456
01:29:19,552 --> 01:29:22,552
I really resented you

1457
01:29:23,597 --> 01:29:26,597
You won't listen to my request

1458
01:29:27,123 --> 01:29:28,873
I thought you were a cold person.

1459
01:29:32,179 --> 01:29:35,179
But now I finally understood.

1460
01:29:37,370 --> 01:29:43,927
Natsuko, are you going to Kubo-kun's place?

1461
01:29:45,568 --> 01:29:46,240
No.

1462
01:29:48,513 --> 01:29:49,779
Are you with me as before?

1463
01:29:50,468 --> 01:29:51,225
I don't like it either

1464
01:29:56,734 --> 01:30:00,421
I've really been taken care of for a long time.

1465
01:30:02,511 --> 01:30:07,343
but I'm tired of living with the help of others

1466
01:30:09,310 --> 01:30:11,026
I want to try living on my own strength

1467
01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:12,777
What are you saying?

1468
01:30:13,890 --> 01:30:15,664
What exactly do you think you can do?

1469
01:30:17,039 --> 01:30:20,307
You'll only get hurt.

1470
01:30:21,880 --> 01:30:22,848
It could be.

1471
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:28,136
But at that time, I won't rely anyone.

1472
01:30:29,690 --> 01:30:32,690
I cry alone and wipe my tears alone

1473
01:30:35,110 --> 01:30:38,110
Natsuko, what about you?

1474
01:30:38,764 --> 01:30:39,447
Papa.

1475
01:30:40,248 --> 01:30:42,107
Natsuko will try walking again

1476
01:30:44,227 --> 01:30:44,804
Natsuko.

1477
01:31:00,771 --> 01:31:02,341
Thank you very much.

1478
01:31:15,537 --> 01:31:16,521
Driver.

1479
01:31:17,083 --> 01:31:21,238
Anywhere is fine, just go to a place where I can see Mount Fuji.

1480
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:46,976
THE END

00:00:14,077 --> 00:00:21,918
Ojosan / Young Miss (1961)

3
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:21,179
Excuse me, sir, a little more to the right.

4
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,499
Where's Kasumi?

5
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,704
I have no idea.

6
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:28,865
I'll find her.

7
00:01:29,218 --> 00:01:30,711
Just call her.

8
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,625
Hey! Kasumi!

9
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:41,833
This is a company photo, so let's get along and shoot.

10
00:01:42,274 --> 00:01:43,828
Sorry to make you waiting.

11
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,337
We already have a good reputation in the company for our pictures.

12
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:54,662
We went to the U.S. last year, so they think we're a bright, open, Americanized family.

13
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:59,834
I'm so happy to be in the sun.

14
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,792
Kasumi is here.
Shall we take the photo?

15
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:06,199
I'm not much of a photographer.

16
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,349
Why Sawai is not here today?

17
00:02:08,966 --> 00:02:10,812
You like salmon roe?

18
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:14,232
I like salmon roe.

19
00:02:14,654 --> 00:02:19,348
You know, usually you eat it like this.
I learned a very nice way to eat it the other day.

20
00:02:19,843 --> 00:02:20,803
I see.

21
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:26,341
My brother has finally become a common husband.

22
00:02:26,366 --> 00:02:27,362
Excuse me, a little more to the right.

23
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:30,708
Excuse me, a little more to the right.

24
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,795
Smile a little more.

25
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:37,561
Smile a little more.

26
00:02:37,586 --> 00:02:38,448
Ma'am.

27
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:40,687
Sushi has arrived.

28
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:44,731
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:45,513
Thank you very much

30
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:48,873
Let's have some sushi and do an interview.

31
00:02:48,898 --> 00:02:49,649
Please.

32
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:52,829
I have to go out.

33
00:02:53,163 --> 00:02:55,770
From now on?
It's Sunday.

34
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:57,530
We're all here.

35
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:00,760
I promised Ochiyo I'd study for the exam with her.

36
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:03,579
It can't be helped.

37
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,321
I'll be back in time for dinner.
Have a good evening.

38
00:03:23,279 --> 00:03:26,799
I'm impressed about you.
How you can study here.

39
00:03:27,688 --> 00:03:29,548
I might have an arranged marriage.

40
00:03:29,648 --> 00:03:30,389
It's good.

41
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:31,053
No way.

42
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:31,706
Why?

43
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,079
You don't have to worry about me?

44
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,738
That's Juliette's line.

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,106
The next line is from Juliette.

46
00:03:37,179 --> 00:03:39,579
That's Juliette's line.

47
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:42,381
I don't want to meet a guy I don't know.

48
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,480
It can't be helped.
It's an arranged marriage.

49
00:03:44,505 --> 00:03:47,521
If I want to get married, I want a love marriage.

50
00:03:47,734 --> 00:03:49,068
That's too boring.

51
00:03:50,068 --> 00:03:51,055
It's like a drama.

52
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:54,175
I read that in a women's magazine.

53
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,582
Marriage for love is the fastest way to a perfect marriage.

54
00:03:57,649 --> 00:04:00,055
There you go again with your superficial knowledge.

55
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,042
You know, when I read that, it hit me.

56
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:07,725
My mom had an arranged marriage.
My mom demanded a perfect marriage so much that my dad cheated on her and ran away from home.

57
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,847
But I don't think that's all the fault of arranged marriages.

58
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,305
So you're going to get married in an arranged marriage?

59
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:14,405
Of course I would, if I had the chance.

60
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,900
It's funny, isn't it?

61
00:04:17,162 --> 00:04:19,095
It's like a lottery and dramatic.

62
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,119
I'm bad luck in lottery

63
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:23,312
You could win third prize at least.

64
00:04:23,449 --> 00:04:25,282
That's why I'm going to do.

65
00:04:26,051 --> 00:04:28,824
I'd like to win third prize at least.

66
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:35,328
I don't wanna go home.

67
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:37,367
You're not kid.

68
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:39,721
We can't go too far.

69
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,954
Let's go to Izu.

70
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,547
They'd be surprised.

71
00:04:42,687 --> 00:04:43,514
I'll buy you some milk.

72
00:04:44,157 --> 00:04:45,124
Maybe we should get some sandwiches.

73
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:48,301
Look, There are too only lovers on board.

74
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:50,245
They're going back from Atami or Yugawara.

75
00:04:50,484 --> 00:04:52,158
Shall we really take a trip too?

76
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,597
No way.
If we do that, we'll get caught in the middle of a manhunt!

77
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:06,352
Come here.

78
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:08,525
What's wrong?

79
00:05:12,849 --> 00:05:14,062
You know him?

80
00:05:14,929 --> 00:05:18,495
He's Sawai.
He works for this company with our father.

81
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:23,105
He's one of three guys who often come over to our house on Sundays.

82
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:28,695
I don't wanna leave.

83
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:35,450
Don't cry.

84
00:05:35,823 --> 00:05:37,177
People are watching you.

85
00:05:45,696 --> 00:05:46,503
Sawai.

86
00:05:49,746 --> 00:05:50,546
Let's go.

87
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,593
Thank you.

88
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,569
Don't thank me.
I just saved your trouble.

89
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:01,349
See you.

90
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:02,042
Kasumi.

91
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:09,540
Kasumi.

92
00:06:11,726 --> 00:06:13,406
You've been daydreaming again, haven't you?

93
00:06:29,051 --> 00:06:29,858
They left.

94
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,251
They scared me.

95
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:33,042
People are not always what they seem.

96
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:39,296
I told you about my birthday party.
He's supposed to be at that party.

97
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,444
If he comes, I'll ask him a lot of questions.

98
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,077
Come on, let's dance!
Don't be shy.

99
00:06:54,756 --> 00:06:55,787
Yes, please.

100
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:06,490
Oh, and just in case you're wondering.
Are you sure there's no one here you like?

101
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,545
Why?
Did you find anyone nice?

102
00:07:08,936 --> 00:07:11,334
Are you into Sawai?

103
00:07:11,436 --> 00:07:13,256
He's playboy.

104
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,436
I'm kind of curious.
I can't wait to see how he turns out.

105
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:22,240
He is very serious when he comes to my house.

106
00:07:22,694 --> 00:07:26,608
3rd prize, 2nd prize, 1st prize, maybe

107
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,577
He's coming.

108
00:07:32,874 --> 00:07:34,468
Please dance with me,Kasumi.

109
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:42,746
Let's dance too.

110
00:07:46,778 --> 00:07:49,699
It's been a year since I left the company.

111
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,199
You've changed a lot, haven't you?

112
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:54,840
You were the director's secretary.
You look wonderful now.

113
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,737
Are you relieved that the exam is over?

114
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,557
No way,
I don't think schoolwork is very important.

115
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:04,862
So your goal is to have a family life?

116
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,323
I'm not into that too.

117
00:08:06,409 --> 00:08:07,307
Why?

118
00:08:07,393 --> 00:08:12,354
I'm a sucker for the dramatic.
I'm not interested in a mediocre life.

119
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:15,651
Dramatic?
That's so you.

120
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:21,469
Keep dancing.

121
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:29,555
I bragged that I was having a birthday party for my daughter at a restaurant in Shinbashi.
The madam brought a bottle of champagne.

122
00:08:30,162 --> 00:08:33,912
She said, "Please take it home and give it to everyone!"

123
00:08:34,286 --> 00:08:35,450
My wife will bring it.

124
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:37,708
That's awesome, isn't it?

125
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:46,111
Shall I open it?

126
00:08:47,689 --> 00:08:49,580
It's fine, it's been chilled for a while.

127
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:06,960
Please have fun,
I'll change my clothes.

128
00:09:07,187 --> 00:09:09,015
Enjoy yourself.

129
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:15,256
He's a good father.

130
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:18,420
He's talking so loudly, like he's trying to teach us a lesson or something, it's like a company party.

131
00:09:19,624 --> 00:09:21,014
He's very black-hearted.

132
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:22,006
Cheers.

133
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,715
Serve me.

134
00:09:29,793 --> 00:09:30,504
It tastes good.

135
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:36,722
I saw you at Tokyo station.

136
00:09:38,043 --> 00:09:38,621
So what?

137
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:40,488
You are easy to forget.

138
00:09:44,822 --> 00:09:46,267
Could you explain it a little more?

139
00:09:46,564 --> 00:09:51,563
Second clue.
She got off the train on her way home from Atami.

140
00:09:52,368 --> 00:09:54,134
Did you see us?

141
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:56,689
I thought she had the nerve to get on a crowd.

142
00:09:56,714 --> 00:10:00,064
Oh my god.
I have to admit.

143
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:02,158
She is a geisha named Beniko.

144
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:03,892
I don't want to know more than that.

145
00:10:04,087 --> 00:10:07,509
But that dramatic scene was very appealing to me.

146
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:10,173
Could you be more specific?

147
00:10:10,329 --> 00:10:11,783
But here..

148
00:10:15,446 --> 00:10:16,829
Shall we dance?

149
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:26,861
You can tell me all the details, but you never know when the director might show up here.

150
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:28,072
Is it such a secret?

151
00:10:28,097 --> 00:10:30,314
It's a secret. He's a hard man to deal with.

152
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:32,728
Let's talk about it some other time, some other place.

153
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:35,204
Sure.
But I'll make you a deal.

154
00:10:36,142 --> 00:10:36,876
What kind?

155
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,829
I'll tell you everything if you keep it a secret from your father.

156
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:41,072
Ok.

157
00:10:41,408 --> 00:10:42,376
Promise me?

158
00:10:44,033 --> 00:10:45,673
How about Sunday this time?

159
00:10:45,915 --> 00:10:47,376
Okay, I'll take you up on it.

160
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:49,204
You're a very dignified man, aren't you?

161
00:10:59,466 --> 00:11:03,278
We are also wearing the same color clothes.

162
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,440
How late do you need to be home today?

163
00:11:05,846 --> 00:11:07,112
I can't take my time.

164
00:11:07,588 --> 00:11:10,987
I am planning to go to a concert with a friend and then go home soon.

165
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:12,815
I feel sorry for your parents because they are so strict.

166
00:11:13,549 --> 00:11:14,447
Are you hungry?

167
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:16,220
You haven't had lunch yet?

168
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:19,119
No,
I've been watching a movie.

169
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:20,737
Where?

170
00:11:21,033 --> 00:11:22,369
I know a good place.

171
00:11:24,057 --> 00:11:24,815
Welcome.

172
00:11:25,354 --> 00:11:28,635
The seats on the second floor are full.

173
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,885
Here's ok.

174
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:31,143
Make yourself at home.

175
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:34,369
You're bad boy.

176
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:35,409
Me?

177
00:11:35,698 --> 00:11:38,401
You went to the second floor with Beniko.

178
00:11:38,683 --> 00:11:40,526
You're pursuing me.

179
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:43,933
But first, let me ask you something.
Are you a friend of mine or are you a detective?

180
00:11:44,276 --> 00:11:46,487
Which is it?
Let me ask you.

181
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,862
Don't act like that.

182
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:50,979
I can't tell anything.

183
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,425
If you don't talk to me, I'll tell your father.

184
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:57,565
Call me Kei-chan.
Then I can call you Kasumi.

185
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:59,237
Fine.
I give you permission.

186
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:02,339
So where do I begin with my confession?

187
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:05,323
First, explain how that day turned out so dramatic.

188
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:07,409
Well, it wasn't that dramatic.

189
00:12:08,058 --> 00:12:11,089
I'd been in Atami since Saturday, and we'd spent the night together, and we'd finally said goodbye.

190
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:14,933
And then we comes back to Tokyo Station... and she said  she doesn't want to say goodbye.

191
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:17,659
I had no choice but to go out to eat with her.

192
00:12:18,206 --> 00:12:19,886
So you're back together again.

193
00:12:20,479 --> 00:12:23,839
No way.
We broke up over dinner.

194
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:26,209
Really?

195
00:12:26,498 --> 00:12:27,889
Of course I'm sure.

196
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,842
But she was crying.

197
00:12:32,529 --> 00:12:33,569
Yeah.

198
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:35,529
Are you jealous of me?

199
00:12:36,834 --> 00:12:38,209
I'm not.

200
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,014
I'm talking about the food. .

201
00:12:41,288 --> 00:12:42,788
Yes, it's done.

202
00:12:49,834 --> 00:12:51,834
But how did you come to know the geisha?

203
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:54,045
Well, I have to tell the story.

204
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,483
When I was a student, I got into a fight in a nightclub.

205
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:01,413
I ended up getting into a fight with him outside the store.

206
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:06,303
He had 5 friends and I wanted to run away.
And she showed up.

207
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:09,167
She took my hand and we were in the car in no time at all.

208
00:13:09,917 --> 00:13:13,652
There was another Geisha and her fat, funny husband in the car.

209
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,495
I like your personality.

210
00:13:18,995 --> 00:13:22,948
Would you like to go to Atami with us?

211
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,862
Ok?

212
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:26,823
She's into you.

213
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:28,862
Please go with her

214
00:13:29,581 --> 00:13:31,659
Please come with us.

215
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:34,159
You also want to be with a woman, right?

216
00:13:34,557 --> 00:13:35,276
But.

217
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,339
You hate me?

218
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:38,503
I like you.

219
00:13:40,263 --> 00:13:41,192
I like you.

220
00:13:41,217 --> 00:13:44,497
It was fun.
It's a bit like a melodramatic movie.

221
00:13:44,942 --> 00:13:46,263
You made it up, didn't you?

222
00:13:46,591 --> 00:13:47,630
No way.

223
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,185
Because it's too well done.

224
00:13:49,349 --> 00:13:51,270
That's how it is between a man and a woman.

225
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,630
I've had this experience more times than I can count.

226
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,364
No way.

227
00:13:54,497 --> 00:13:55,161
It's true.

228
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,700
But my current state of mind is that I wanted a girlfriend.

229
00:13:58,739 --> 00:13:59,388
Like you.

230
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:02,427
You told me there are many women.

231
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,458
There's a difference between a girl and a girlfriend.
I can get a girl in a minute.

232
00:14:06,778 --> 00:14:07,614
I can't trust you.

233
00:14:08,528 --> 00:14:09,856
I'll show it now.

234
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:10,974
Really?

235
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:25,585
Are you a student?

236
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,905
Of course I'm a student.

237
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,132
It's okay even if you are a student.

238
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,663
What's the hell?

239
00:14:31,764 --> 00:14:37,584
I'm older than you.
Sorry.

240
00:14:37,921 --> 00:14:40,210
Your attitude is so cute.

241
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:41,173
Coffee please.

242
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:48,040
This jacket is very cool.

243
00:14:48,065 --> 00:14:49,509
You think so?

244
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:50,837
You like me?

245
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,345
You're nice.

246
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:56,916
Wanna hang out?

247
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:57,447
Ok.

248
00:14:57,472 --> 00:14:58,260
Where do you want to go?

249
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:00,806
Let's have a night out.

250
00:15:01,002 --> 00:15:02,595
I really like you.

251
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:18,734
Do you need something?

252
00:15:18,844 --> 00:15:20,805
You're alone?
Hangout with me

253
00:15:32,914 --> 00:15:34,368
Did you hear something just now?

254
00:15:34,672 --> 00:15:37,829
maybe Kasumi is back.

255
00:15:38,493 --> 00:15:42,844
Actually, the director asked me today if Kasumi marry to Maki.

256
00:15:43,352 --> 00:15:44,204
Maki?

257
00:15:44,532 --> 00:15:49,008
I hear Director's taken a shine to Maki because they're from the same prefecture.

258
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:52,977
That's good, it was Maki, and I think it's a good idea.

259
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:55,813
But does she intend to get married?

260
00:15:56,047 --> 00:15:57,180
I'm home.

261
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:00,837
Welcome back.

262
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:01,861
Sorry I'm late.

263
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:02,657
Welcome back.

264
00:16:03,118 --> 00:16:04,868
How was the concert?

265
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,900
It was fun.

266
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:08,650
Didn't she wear a kimono?

267
00:16:08,962 --> 00:16:13,025
But she didn't want to wear a kimono.

268
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:14,665
I see.

269
00:16:16,122 --> 00:16:16,942
Is that baked?

270
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:18,661
I'm not jealous.

271
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,583
That fish.

272
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:23,286
This..

273
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:26,286
what did you do wrong?

274
00:16:27,536 --> 00:16:31,200
Oh...I'm surprised.

275
00:16:55,727 --> 00:16:56,633
That's dirty.

276
00:16:57,696 --> 00:16:58,750
For what?

277
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:02,327
It's nothing.

278
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:04,928
You said something.

279
00:17:05,053 --> 00:17:06,553
You said something.

280
00:17:08,803 --> 00:17:12,085
Sometimes unexplainable wonders happen in the world.

281
00:17:12,983 --> 00:17:16,147
When I went to America, mediumship was all the rage.

282
00:17:17,374 --> 00:17:18,858
Anyway..

283
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:26,255
Are you still not going to marry for the time being?

284
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:28,435
I don't care.

285
00:17:31,177 --> 00:17:32,810
Where she's gone?

286
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:44,565
What do you think about Maki?

287
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:46,979
He's your candidate of choice?

288
00:17:47,034 --> 00:17:50,276
I'm going to leave it up to you.

289
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:58,034
But most of all, I want you to have a spiritually happy marriage.

290
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,909
But what do you mean by happy?

291
00:18:01,675 --> 00:18:05,542
Peace.
And quiet love.

292
00:18:06,175 --> 00:18:08,761
It's not being dramatic at all.

293
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:10,284
It's good.

294
00:18:10,985 --> 00:18:17,321
After all, marriage is a long venture.
If it makes you happy, it doesn't have to be Maki.

295
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:20,727
But you must promise me this.

296
00:18:21,336 --> 00:18:25,266
If you find a young man you like, I want you to report him to me immediately.

297
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:28,774
And I will find out who he is.

298
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:33,641
If he passes, I will bless you all.

299
00:18:34,336 --> 00:18:35,852
OK?

300
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:40,032
OK.
But now I don't have a man like that.

301
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,094
So please wait.

302
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:45,571
I don't force you.

303
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,028
I have a phone call from Mrs. Tamura.

304
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:59,082
She said thank you for coming today.

305
00:18:59,541 --> 00:19:01,798
I haven't met her yet. She's so polite.

306
00:19:02,994 --> 00:19:05,775
Answer the phone.

307
00:19:16,149 --> 00:19:17,579
Hello?

308
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,509
Are you Kasumi?

309
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,970
Hold on.

310
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:25,087
It's me.
Sorry for the last time.

311
00:19:25,774 --> 00:19:28,532
She's a madam at restaurant.

312
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,306
I asked her to pretend as Tamura's madam.

313
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:34,571
You're bad.
I'm upset.

314
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:38,274
Why?
Because you wouldn't believe me, so I got the girl and I showed her to you.

315
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:42,313
I felt bad for her, so we ate okonomiyaki together.

316
00:19:42,477 --> 00:19:48,001
I'm not asking you that.
After you left, I was seduced by certain men.

317
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:54,048
Most men think you're too conservative.

318
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,970
Anyway, I'll see you soon.
When you call me at the office, please use the name Tamura to call me.

319
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:06,592
He's so bad.

320
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:14,272
They're staring at us.

321
00:20:14,905 --> 00:20:17,170
They're from the food department.
That's disgusting.

322
00:20:17,748 --> 00:20:21,186
They are always talking about calories, vitamins.
They wear a lot of makeup.

323
00:20:21,514 --> 00:20:23,467
I wonder if they're wearing makeup with vitamins.

324
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:25,123
Let's go there.

325
00:20:29,071 --> 00:20:33,782
So last Sunday was the first of many memorable dates for you.

326
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:36,360
It wasn't a date.
I was just listening to him.

327
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:37,837
So it's a date.

328
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:41,055
You're an idiot.
A date is something that only two people in love do.

329
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,555
You two are in love now.

330
00:20:43,798 --> 00:20:45,516
Why you think so?

331
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:49,962
They say love begins with a mental strip.

332
00:20:50,368 --> 00:20:51,813
What's that?

333
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:58,391
Sawai confided in you.
You peeked into his secret parts.

334
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:01,347
He's just talking on his own.

335
00:21:01,372 --> 00:21:05,558
He wants to peek at his secret parts
You want to peek.

336
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:13,097
It says in the book that only when a man and a woman develop a taste for stripping from a spiritual to a physical relationship does a man and a woman fall in love.

337
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:14,878
In a women's magazine?

338
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,230
It's a psychoanalytical book.

339
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:19,626
Come.

340
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:27,751
They say that a woman should never reveal her secret parts.

341
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:32,290
They say you should always wear a mystical veil over your bed, even when you're married.

342
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:34,954
Is that even in the psychoanalysis book?

343
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:36,868
This is from a women's magazine.

344
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,673
Don't make fun of me.

345
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:42,563
That's not why I confided in you.

346
00:21:43,829 --> 00:21:47,290
I'm thinking of turning down his offer.

347
00:21:47,962 --> 00:21:49,727
You're going on a second date already?

348
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:51,993
He said we'd go skating.

349
00:21:54,384 --> 00:21:56,477
Well, we can't be outdone.

350
00:21:57,306 --> 00:21:59,852
What do you mean?

351
00:22:01,446 --> 00:22:07,235
Actually, you know, this past Sunday was the first date for me and Maki as well, a memorable one.

352
00:22:09,602 --> 00:22:10,579
I'm sorry.

353
00:22:11,181 --> 00:22:13,102
So did you have a mental strip down too?

354
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:14,384
No at all.

355
00:22:14,696 --> 00:22:20,876
I've been trying to get him to take his clothes off too.
He seems to have developed a sense of shame, and he doesn't want to take off his clothes.

356
00:22:20,999 --> 00:22:23,242
That's a little weird.

357
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:27,867
Anyway, let's go skating together.
I'll call him and ask him.

358
00:22:29,179 --> 00:22:32,593
Can you come over?
I made you one of my good ones.

359
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:33,789
What did you make?

360
00:22:34,257 --> 00:22:36,023
Clothes for Skating.

361
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:48,507
I believe the other day the director spoke to your father....

362
00:22:50,234 --> 00:22:52,046
Didn't your father say something about me?

363
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,992
I heard it.

364
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,609
I'm waiting for your answer.

365
00:22:58,234 --> 00:23:00,242
My father made me promise...

366
00:23:00,781 --> 00:23:03,531
If I like someone, I should tell him right away.

367
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,609
He's a sensible guy.

368
00:23:05,874 --> 00:23:07,804
He's going to investigate before he approves.

369
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:09,085
He's going to investigate me?

370
00:23:09,437 --> 00:23:11,882
Teach me,Maki.

371
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,249
Teach me,Maki.

372
00:23:18,234 --> 00:23:21,249
Ready? 1.2.

373
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:23,132
I feel scared.

374
00:23:23,157 --> 00:23:24,273
Watch out!

375
00:23:24,382 --> 00:23:26,460
What are you doing?
You are stupid.

376
00:23:29,539 --> 00:23:30,921
You hit her.

377
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:33,874
What's the hell?

378
00:23:34,406 --> 00:23:35,679
What?

379
00:23:36,078 --> 00:23:37,257
What's wrong?

380
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:40,476
What is this, a fight?
All right, let's get loud.

381
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,843
Come on!

382
00:23:48,815 --> 00:23:50,768
Please wait over there.

383
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,026
Let's go.

384
00:23:52,627 --> 00:23:55,495
Bring it on!

385
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:02,601
Are you alright?

386
00:24:02,969 --> 00:24:03,484
I'm alright.

387
00:24:04,125 --> 00:24:05,539
Where are you going?

388
00:24:06,297 --> 00:24:06,601
Oh.

389
00:24:06,626 --> 00:24:07,109
What's wrong?

390
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,219
I only have 50 yen.

391
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:12,163
My bag was taken by Kasumi...

392
00:24:12,188 --> 00:24:14,594
Please drive as far as you can go for 50 yen.

393
00:24:15,547 --> 00:24:17,930
Please go to Higashi Ginza

394
00:24:19,755 --> 00:24:22,646
I'm home.
Mom, pay for the cab.

395
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:28,075
Please come in.

396
00:24:28,138 --> 00:24:30,927
Mom, pay for the cab.
Please come in.

397
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,549
Tend to his wounds.

398
00:24:33,729 --> 00:24:36,073
Please come in.

399
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,010
Please come in.

400
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:45,401
Sorry to interrupt.

401
00:24:45,426 --> 00:24:49,682
Don't worry.
My mom's a little wary of men.

402
00:24:49,707 --> 00:24:51,526
My father is cheating.

403
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,729
is this fine?

404
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:56,276
She's my mom.
This is Maki.

405
00:24:56,518 --> 00:24:58,174
Nice to meet you.

406
00:24:58,456 --> 00:25:03,370
I've always wanted to meet you.

407
00:25:03,395 --> 00:25:05,643
I have a phone call from Kasumi Fujisawa.

408
00:25:05,668 --> 00:25:07,331
I'll be back in a minute.

409
00:25:07,753 --> 00:25:09,058
Please come in.

410
00:25:09,714 --> 00:25:14,542
I was worried about you.
How come you didn't have any money?

411
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:19,523
Are you with Maki?
Have fun.

412
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,453
We're just leaving.

413
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,906
I'm trying to think of something to say to Mother, so I'm having Kei-chan come up with an excuse.

414
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:44,246
Hello, tickets?

415
00:25:44,364 --> 00:25:46,223
I'm just buying the program.

416
00:25:53,309 --> 00:25:57,192
Suppose you were with Ochiyo.
It's like that melodroma you hate.

417
00:26:07,713 --> 00:26:09,424
You know her?

418
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:10,720
Yes.

419
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:13,580
Hi.

420
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:18,585
I'll take you home.

421
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,032
Is she one of the your girls?

422
00:26:23,192 --> 00:26:23,739
Kind of.

423
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:26,551
She's still looking.

424
00:26:26,576 --> 00:26:27,404
I don't care.

425
00:26:33,453 --> 00:26:34,306
Welcome.

426
00:26:35,113 --> 00:26:37,526
I'll give you some gifts.

427
00:26:37,747 --> 00:26:40,647
Thanks.
Kasumi wouldn't visit you?

428
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,008
She said she was visiting you from college on Saturday.

429
00:26:45,796 --> 00:26:47,089
Maybe we've crossed paths.

430
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:50,246
She told me she visited you often these days.

431
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:51,946
No?

432
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:55,707
Yes she is vising me often.

433
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,644
This pickle... a long, thin cucumber... pickled with sake lees or something...

434
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:04,124
This is awesome.

435
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:39,225
What do you wanna talk?

436
00:27:40,664 --> 00:27:43,051
Actually, I'm depressed.

437
00:27:43,384 --> 00:27:44,344
Why?

438
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:47,531
A woman threatens me if I don't marry her.

439
00:27:48,479 --> 00:27:52,646
Okay, okay.
The woman with the long hair outside the movie theater the other night?

440
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:56,464
Yes. She's a woman named Asako from a supply store on Miyuki Rd.

441
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:59,828
I'm tired of it, and she keeps trying to scare me.

442
00:28:00,618 --> 00:28:02,258
You didn't handle her?

443
00:28:02,584 --> 00:28:03,444
Yeah..

444
00:28:03,664 --> 00:28:05,284
That's bad.

445
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,517
Have a seat.

446
00:28:12,589 --> 00:28:14,829
Hey, you don't have to worry.

447
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:19,309
Women often say they're going to die. It's just a threat.

448
00:28:19,897 --> 00:28:21,790
But she is serious.

449
00:28:22,437 --> 00:28:27,557
Don't think too much.
No one fall in love a man like you.

450
00:28:30,883 --> 00:28:32,716
I feel a little better now.

451
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:39,651
Don't do that.

452
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:42,158
We're such weird friends.

453
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:43,318
Why?

454
00:28:43,857 --> 00:28:46,750
When I see you, I have this habit of confiding in you about everything.

455
00:28:47,658 --> 00:28:49,518
I feel something weird.

456
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:51,084
Something tells me.

457
00:28:51,232 --> 00:28:53,092
Don't think too much.

458
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:55,599
We're just normal friend.

459
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:59,511
But we're lying about something.

460
00:29:00,647 --> 00:29:03,621
Everything you've said has been a lie?

461
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,647
It could be.

462
00:29:13,951 --> 00:29:16,491
You are kind of weird today.

463
00:29:17,125 --> 00:29:19,638
Don't think too much.

464
00:29:20,298 --> 00:29:22,145
I'm going to be weird too.

465
00:29:38,412 --> 00:29:39,212
What are you looking at?

466
00:29:40,184 --> 00:29:41,924
That fountain.

467
00:29:42,171 --> 00:29:42,877
Same here.

468
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,484
You were talking about that woman...

469
00:29:49,604 --> 00:29:50,897
I don't wanna talk about her.

470
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,125
If you want to get away from that woman, there is a way.

471
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:55,678
You're going to do something.

472
00:29:56,666 --> 00:29:59,592
I feel sorry for her at the time, but it's the best way to give up.

473
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:01,211
What?

474
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,804
Why don't you just get married?

475
00:30:04,239 --> 00:30:05,185
with someone.

476
00:30:07,421 --> 00:30:08,661
For example, with me.

477
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,901
Oh, my God. I can't believe I'm going to marry you.
You're not kidding, are you?

478
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,562
Okay, let's get married.

479
00:30:16,921 --> 00:30:18,188
I feel weird.

480
00:30:18,243 --> 00:30:19,150
Don't worry.

481
00:30:19,476 --> 00:30:20,256
But..

482
00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:29,009
So you're saying you kissed him twice?

483
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:32,017
I don't know.
I didn't count it.

484
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,653
So did you do it more?

485
00:30:34,153 --> 00:30:34,720
No.

486
00:30:36,452 --> 00:30:39,086
Anyway, let's get serious.
What did it feel like to kiss him?

487
00:30:40,354 --> 00:30:43,067
I don't know what it felt like.

488
00:30:43,693 --> 00:30:44,326
Did you feel good?

489
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:47,372
I don't know, but it felt like I was getting hot and my body was evaporating.

490
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,232
Oh my god.

491
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:53,747
That's good to know,
Then what happened next?

492
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,060
Next?

493
00:30:55,406 --> 00:30:58,946
Talk to me!
I'm going to use it as a reference.

494
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,069
Then what happened next?

495
00:31:04,116 --> 00:31:06,429
Then we went to eat okonomiyaki.

496
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:10,386
I'm going to make an offer to your father tomorrow.

497
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,196
Don't do that.

498
00:31:11,296 --> 00:31:13,376
Why?
Keep it until you finish college?

499
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:16,043
I don't care to quit college.

500
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:19,710
I promised my dad I'd tell him if I ever met someone I liked.

501
00:31:19,776 --> 00:31:20,583
Then do it.

502
00:31:21,084 --> 00:31:22,904
That's where he'll look into it.

503
00:31:23,477 --> 00:31:24,424
Don't scare me.

504
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:25,391
Really.

505
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,567
What are you going to do?

506
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,774
Are you serious?

507
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:31,087
Of course I am.

508
00:31:31,112 --> 00:31:33,287
I don't know what to do.

509
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:35,706
Leave it to me.

510
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:37,341
Yes.

511
00:31:37,545 --> 00:31:38,732
In exchange, I have a condition.

512
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:39,240
What?

513
00:31:39,873 --> 00:31:44,379
From now on, you will not hide anything from me, either before or after our marriage.

514
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:46,472
You all have to confide in each other.

515
00:31:46,963 --> 00:31:47,543
Ok.

516
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:48,573
Really?

517
00:31:48,877 --> 00:31:52,090
I want to marry you tomorrow.

518
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:53,468
Even now.

519
00:31:58,067 --> 00:31:59,420
Why you are impressed?

520
00:31:59,513 --> 00:32:03,333
That's pretty good for Kasumi.
But what about that supply store's girl problem?

521
00:32:03,603 --> 00:32:10,023
That's actually what's bothering me.
If our father hears about it, of course he'll say no.

522
00:32:11,094 --> 00:32:14,048
So we're going to have the wedding ceremony as soon as possible.

523
00:32:14,218 --> 00:32:20,451
That's dangerous.
Instead of that, go see that Asako-san and ask her to give up on Kei-chan.

524
00:32:26,605 --> 00:32:30,552
Here it is.
There's a woman here. Is she Asako?

525
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:33,287
I don't wanna do it.

526
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,920
Why?

527
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:35,194
I don't wanna meet her.

528
00:32:35,294 --> 00:32:37,000
It can't be helped.

529
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,794
I'm checking her.

530
00:32:40,348 --> 00:32:41,374
Welcome.

531
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,054
Looking for a gift?

532
00:32:45,161 --> 00:32:45,954
For your dad?

533
00:32:46,251 --> 00:32:46,758
No.

534
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:48,898
For young man.

535
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:52,959
How about this?

536
00:32:56,332 --> 00:32:57,185
How about this?

537
00:33:08,248 --> 00:33:09,801
I bought Maki a present.

538
00:33:09,992 --> 00:33:11,098
Was she?

539
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:16,091
She's nice.I asked her who you were, just in case.
Would you like to meet her?

540
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:17,546
I don't wanna meet her.

541
00:33:18,446 --> 00:33:21,219
I just called and arranged to meet Kei-chan.

542
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:25,177
It was good you didn't meet her.

543
00:33:27,076 --> 00:33:27,976
Yeah.

544
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:29,989
You think so?

545
00:33:30,642 --> 00:33:31,342
Yeah.

546
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:35,392
You got a better idea that your dad wouldn't have to investigate me?

547
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,453
Cartoonishly good idea.

548
00:33:37,602 --> 00:33:39,442
I haven't got it.

549
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:41,455
He's giving me a headache.

550
00:33:42,133 --> 00:33:45,080
I leave it to you.

551
00:33:46,379 --> 00:33:49,993
Why don't you have him look into Kei-chan, and maybe He won't find out.

552
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,935
I don't think so.
He often calls our office.

553
00:33:54,048 --> 00:33:54,695
I see.

554
00:33:54,981 --> 00:33:57,314
I won't give my father time to check Kei-chan out.

555
00:33:57,732 --> 00:33:59,478
Well, we'll ask him permission on the spot.

556
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:04,808
Ok let's get started!

557
00:34:04,852 --> 00:34:06,246
You're too simple.

558
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:20,342
I went to shopping.

559
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,556
Be more polite.

560
00:34:23,454 --> 00:34:26,908
Didn't Kasumi say something about stopping somewhere today?

561
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:29,347
Yes, she said she was going to visit her brother.

562
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,154
I see.

563
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:32,380
To Asamichi.

564
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,151
Hello?

565
00:34:50,905 --> 00:34:51,832
Are you Kasumi?

566
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:54,749
Welcome.
It's unusual you visit us.

567
00:34:54,924 --> 00:34:55,891
I happened to come here.

568
00:34:56,164 --> 00:34:58,951
Anyway thanks for coming.

569
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:02,257
Come on in, we have just the cake for you.
You want coffee?

570
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:03,230
I'll have tea.

571
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:04,727
I'll heat some water.

572
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:08,871
I'll answer.

573
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:10,824
Hello?

574
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,379
Hey, Kasumi. I didn't know you were there.

575
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,522
I knew you'd be there.

576
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:23,894
I just wanted you to leave early before it gets too late.

577
00:35:26,222 --> 00:35:27,889
Say hello to Akiko.

578
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:32,080
I guess I was wrong.

579
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:39,588
Oh you.

580
00:35:40,062 --> 00:35:40,802
What can I do for you?

581
00:35:42,105 --> 00:35:43,305
Sawai is coming here?

582
00:35:44,011 --> 00:35:45,945
I'll get ready..

583
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,060
I agree.

584
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,607
Really?

585
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:58,095
I knew Sawai well when he worked with me.
I'm sure he's perfect for you.

586
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,738
Thank you, sister.

587
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:04,124
I was thinking maybe it was.

588
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:05,788
Why?

589
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,876
I met him at birthday party.
I know exactly what you mean.

590
00:36:09,286 --> 00:36:11,766
So you guys have figured it out by now?

591
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:13,160
Just me.

592
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:15,333
Our family don't know about it.

593
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,667
I'm relieved.

594
00:36:17,447 --> 00:36:18,920
Have a eat.

595
00:36:21,842 --> 00:36:26,509
If our family disagrees, will you support us?

596
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:28,001
Of course I would.

597
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:29,874
Please.

598
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:32,914
I'm on your side.

599
00:36:37,503 --> 00:36:39,430
Why he suddenly is coming.

600
00:36:39,536 --> 00:36:41,536
He might be visiting for asking money.

601
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,076
I'm home.

602
00:36:43,303 --> 00:36:44,023
Welcome back.

603
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:45,655
No way.

604
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:51,122
Maybe he should ask my husband to play matchmaker.

605
00:36:51,354 --> 00:36:56,276
It would make sense to bring the fiancée along.

606
00:36:59,409 --> 00:37:00,283
He's here.

607
00:37:02,242 --> 00:37:04,275
Please answer.

608
00:37:12,718 --> 00:37:13,872
Welcome back.

609
00:37:15,365 --> 00:37:16,238
Welcome.

610
00:37:16,532 --> 00:37:17,438
Excuse me.

611
00:37:19,912 --> 00:37:20,846
Come in.

612
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:24,319
Wait in the room.

613
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,039
Serve him a beer.

614
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:40,806
I wanna kiss you.

615
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:44,527
Please don't worry.

616
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,795
You're so cute, I could eat you.

617
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:53,963
You have to be serious.

618
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:56,945
It's cold, isn't it?

619
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:58,092
Welcome.

620
00:38:02,035 --> 00:38:05,862
He says he has something important to discuss with me.
Please get out.

621
00:38:18,416 --> 00:38:19,642
What do you mean?

622
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:21,449
Well...

623
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:25,792
I'd like to have your daughter.

624
00:38:27,146 --> 00:38:29,252
What are you talking about?

625
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,727
What happened?

626
00:38:40,551 --> 00:38:42,678
He's here to borrow some money.

627
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,843
Serve him another beer.

628
00:38:55,770 --> 00:39:00,364
I see what you mean.

629
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:06,782
I'll have to discuss these issues with my wife.
Wait a minute, please.

630
00:39:07,469 --> 00:39:08,722
Excuse me.

631
00:39:21,206 --> 00:39:22,319
He's here to borrow some money?

632
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:24,152
No at all.

633
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:29,549
I'm sure he'll come back and investigate about you and get back to you.

634
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:32,352
Don't worry.
But I worry.

635
00:39:32,592 --> 00:39:34,919
You're a jerk.
That doesn't make me feel any safer.

636
00:39:37,885 --> 00:39:39,885
I'll drink this if I have to.

637
00:39:40,191 --> 00:39:41,038
Are you dying?

638
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:43,036
Don't tell anyone, but it's got sugar in it.

639
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,329
You can't deceive him.

640
00:39:45,088 --> 00:39:46,708
But he's late.

641
00:39:47,381 --> 00:39:48,934
I'll go to see him.

642
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:09,380
I had my staff check it out, and here's Sawai-kun and Maki-kun's report.
Take a look.

643
00:40:18,064 --> 00:40:18,711
Really?

644
00:40:19,124 --> 00:40:20,991
We have no chance.

645
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:26,423
I don't have a choice in the matter, and I don't care if it's a act,
I'll take sugar or whatever.

646
00:40:44,429 --> 00:40:49,009
You're such a bad girl.
You never tell me anything.

647
00:40:49,361 --> 00:40:52,128
I'm so glad.

648
00:40:56,409 --> 00:41:00,202
Let's have party.
Prepare the food.

649
00:41:00,227 --> 00:41:01,246
I'll get it.

650
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:02,324
Kasumi.

651
00:41:03,324 --> 00:41:04,244
Yes.

652
00:41:07,871 --> 00:41:10,531
You have good eyes for men.

653
00:41:11,037 --> 00:41:14,890
Of the three, your father and I trusted Maki the most.

654
00:41:15,331 --> 00:41:19,431
Your father just showed me the report about him.

655
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:23,121
Sawai is super good.

656
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,920
Keep eye on the food.

657
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:29,800
His relationships with women are spotless.
And he's got 150000 yen in the bank at such a young age.

658
00:41:31,481 --> 00:41:33,928
The report is so nice.

659
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:52,549
Here.

660
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,863
Let's have a seat.

661
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:02,423
It's a nice view.

662
00:42:02,943 --> 00:42:06,450
Is it?
It's too dark for me.

663
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:08,678
We're such weird friends.

664
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:09,625
Why?

665
00:42:10,198 --> 00:42:14,058
When I see you, I have this habit of confiding in you about everything.

666
00:42:14,142 --> 00:42:16,296
I feel something weird.

667
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:18,873
Don't think too much.

668
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:22,840
But we're lying about something.

669
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
You are kind of weird today.

670
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,747
You think so?

671
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:31,897
I'm going to be weird too.

672
00:42:32,045 --> 00:42:33,445
I'm going to be weird too.

673
00:42:33,627 --> 00:42:34,247
Maki.

674
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:35,160
Chieko.

675
00:42:42,861 --> 00:42:45,121
I have to cook Okonomiyaki.

676
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:51,746
So, what about the wedding?

677
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,620
I don't care if it's tonight or anytime soon.

678
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:56,353
Don't rush.

679
00:42:56,378 --> 00:43:00,772
Maybe sooner would be better.

680
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:04,528
I can't wait long.

681
00:43:04,603 --> 00:43:07,823
What about college, you got a year left?

682
00:43:08,089 --> 00:43:09,056
I could quit.

683
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,319
She's proactive.

684
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:13,286
Have a eat.

685
00:43:13,945 --> 00:43:26,601
Maki has already been living with a woman at a bar in Ginza for a year and and they have continued their de facto marital relationship.

686
00:43:27,209 --> 00:43:30,689
He's a dreadful man.

687
00:44:22,255 --> 00:44:26,942
You'll see me when you're married to her.

688
00:44:31,693 --> 00:44:33,760
I like younger women like you.

689
00:44:34,181 --> 00:44:36,455
I don't like a girl over 20.

690
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:46,944
I'll never leave from you.

691
00:44:47,847 --> 00:44:52,187
If you marry someone behind my back, I'll kill you or I'll die.

692
00:45:22,279 --> 00:45:22,973
Kei-chan.

693
00:45:31,882 --> 00:45:33,569
Oh you.

694
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,297
Please treat me nice.

695
00:45:39,031 --> 00:45:42,144
You won't wake up.

696
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:49,457
From now on, don't ever cheat on me.

697
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:51,754
I know.

698
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:55,481
You smell good.

699
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,719
How about you take a bath?

700
00:46:00,407 --> 00:46:01,868
And after we eat, we'll go for a walk.

701
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:05,047
You are naked.

702
00:46:06,414 --> 00:46:09,445
Don't look at me.

703
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:18,235
Oh Ochiyo?

704
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:20,813
Good morning.
I thought you were still sleeping.

705
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:24,578
Because...

706
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,078
Was he nice to you this morning?

707
00:46:29,461 --> 00:46:32,922
Very.
I wasn't afraid of him.

708
00:46:34,203 --> 00:46:37,094
No, I don't know.
No, you don't.

709
00:46:37,797 --> 00:46:40,672
What's wrong?
What did Kei-chan? do to you?

710
00:46:44,313 --> 00:46:47,250
Don't provoke me, it'll make me sad.

711
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,482
I have to go.
I wish you all the best.

712
00:47:04,823 --> 00:47:08,612
Maki?
I'm sorry. Secretary, Maki please.

713
00:47:13,143 --> 00:47:14,300
She killed herself.

714
00:47:14,362 --> 00:47:17,050
She was heartbroken.
She left a suicide note.

715
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:20,367
She died?

716
00:47:20,468 --> 00:47:21,687
She tried to kill herself.

717
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,689
I was relieved

718
00:47:42,463 --> 00:47:43,220
What's wrong?

719
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:44,674
It's nothing.

720
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,970
Sawai.

721
00:47:49,244 --> 00:47:51,236
She was heartbroken.

722
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,431
I know what it's like to die of rejection.

723
00:47:56,213 --> 00:47:58,299
I want to die, too.

724
00:47:59,845 --> 00:48:02,135
I was just kidding.

725
00:48:03,096 --> 00:48:04,573
That's what I thought at the time.

726
00:48:05,893 --> 00:48:07,424
Is she your wife?

727
00:48:10,307 --> 00:48:12,159
Congratulations.

728
00:48:12,596 --> 00:48:17,291
I came here by chance.

729
00:48:17,455 --> 00:48:19,120
What a coincidence.

730
00:48:19,729 --> 00:48:22,323
Come here,dad.

731
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:24,409
See you.

732
00:48:30,499 --> 00:48:32,640
What happened to you?

733
00:48:33,241 --> 00:48:35,577
I thought she was Asako.

734
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,218
You don't have to worry about that.

735
00:48:38,296 --> 00:48:39,851
Look at the Beniko.
She is fine.

736
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:42,460
Yeah.

737
00:48:43,179 --> 00:48:45,968
Promise me you won't worry about that anymore.

738
00:49:08,855 --> 00:49:10,012
You're gonna be late.

739
00:49:40,547 --> 00:49:42,008
Oshiyo, How are you?

740
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:44,946
I'm fine.
I'm very busy.

741
00:49:45,547 --> 00:49:48,016
Oh, of course I'm having fun.

742
00:49:48,493 --> 00:49:51,618
How much one of your eggs?

743
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:54,047
Egg?
Just a minute.

744
00:49:54,422 --> 00:49:56,626
Mom, how much is one egg around here?

745
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:57,266
Egg?

746
00:50:00,055 --> 00:50:02,422
How much is one egg around here?

747
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:06,352
Egg?
about 14 yen.

748
00:50:06,547 --> 00:50:08,180
13yen.

749
00:50:09,701 --> 00:50:11,099
It's 13yen.

750
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,412
Thirteen yen?
Wow, that's expensive!

751
00:50:13,779 --> 00:50:16,552
I found a store that sells four for 50 yen

752
00:50:17,763 --> 00:50:18,701
I go there every day!

753
00:50:19,185 --> 00:50:22,021
Why so many eggs?
Okay, I get it.

754
00:50:23,818 --> 00:50:25,935
You're newlyweds, so you drink every day?

755
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,053
I use eggs in many ways. Boil them, fry them...

756
00:50:29,474 --> 00:50:34,053
He has a lot of ingredients these days, so I'm trying to feed him nutritious food.

757
00:50:38,381 --> 00:50:40,826
Excuse me.

758
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:46,170
How is Kasumi?

759
00:50:46,748 --> 00:50:47,936
She's fine.

760
00:50:48,865 --> 00:50:55,279
Would you like to have a party with us this Christmas?

761
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:56,482
That's good.

762
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:58,537
Try talking to her about it.

763
00:50:59,154 --> 00:51:00,607
I think she'll be happy.

764
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:02,545
Sorry to bother you.

765
00:51:09,455 --> 00:51:13,502
Salt and pepper to taste.

766
00:51:22,999 --> 00:51:25,569
He came back too early.

767
00:51:25,976 --> 00:51:26,960
Welcome back.

768
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,935
Kei-chan is not here?

769
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:34,833
Who are you?

770
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,966
Tell him I am Asako.

771
00:51:43,098 --> 00:51:44,934
I'll wait for him.

772
00:52:01,043 --> 00:52:05,254
They say a thief is more than a victim in that he's full of fear.

773
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:07,473
I must stay strong.

774
00:52:09,387 --> 00:52:11,762
I'll turn on the stove.Take off your coat.

775
00:52:33,094 --> 00:52:35,344
Please, read this.

776
00:52:41,274 --> 00:52:43,563
You got married last month?

777
00:52:44,938 --> 00:52:46,587
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.

778
00:52:47,563 --> 00:52:49,446
You did nothing wrong.

779
00:52:52,436 --> 00:52:53,045
Where are you going?

780
00:52:53,514 --> 00:52:56,959
I'll go get the laundry.
I'll have to ask you for the permission?

781
00:53:37,568 --> 00:53:38,825
Welcome back.

782
00:53:39,348 --> 00:53:40,325
Why did you let her in the house?

783
00:53:40,396 --> 00:53:42,904
She forced her way into the house.

784
00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:47,794
I'm going to make pork stew tonight, so please let me know after you talk to her.

785
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:57,688
Why did you come?

786
00:53:57,805 --> 00:53:58,876
I wanted to make sure.

787
00:53:59,251 --> 00:54:02,266
I was in shock.
I couldn't sleep.

788
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:03,891
I'm sorry.

789
00:54:04,126 --> 00:54:06,360
You're a coward.

790
00:54:06,462 --> 00:54:10,008
You should have gotten married after you told me.

791
00:54:10,196 --> 00:54:13,415
You threatened me with death.

792
00:54:13,813 --> 00:54:14,782
You bastard!

793
00:54:15,055 --> 00:54:16,180
What do you want me to do?

794
00:54:16,844 --> 00:54:17,813
 What are you looking at?

795
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:21,626
There's nothing to be done.
I had a glimmer of hope before I came here.

796
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:27,048
I feel better now that I'm here.
And now that I've met you...

797
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:29,032
Are you leaving?

798
00:54:29,368 --> 00:54:31,282
Are you leaving?

799
00:54:32,048 --> 00:54:33,102
I'm sorry to bother you.

800
00:54:54,562 --> 00:54:55,523
See you.

801
00:55:03,083 --> 00:55:06,755
I'm going back through that door.

802
00:55:06,865 --> 00:55:08,201
She's in danger.

803
00:55:11,247 --> 00:55:12,740
Close the door.

804
00:55:34,516 --> 00:55:36,414
I'm sorry to bother you.

805
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:39,508
You should send her.

806
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:40,133
You're right.

807
00:55:40,297 --> 00:55:40,977
Don't worry.

808
00:55:41,391 --> 00:55:42,891
I've had enough of your pretense of kindness.

809
00:55:43,195 --> 00:55:44,242
Don't say that.

810
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:47,531
I'll be alright.
I'll go home alone. I'll live on my own.

811
00:55:48,352 --> 00:55:49,367
But.

812
00:55:49,392 --> 00:55:52,422
If you come, I'll scream on the stairs.

813
00:55:53,047 --> 00:55:57,008
I'll scream your name out loud.

814
00:55:59,166 --> 00:56:00,470
Is she ok?

815
00:56:01,174 --> 00:56:02,236
I'm sorry I bothered you.

816
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:06,494
Don't say that.
Let's eat early.

817
00:56:11,398 --> 00:56:12,796
Are you starving?

818
00:56:13,179 --> 00:56:17,038
I don't feel like eating right now.

819
00:56:17,757 --> 00:56:19,062
You are too weak.

820
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:21,085
What's this?

821
00:56:21,343 --> 00:56:24,140
Your sister brought me a Christmas present from the office today.

822
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:25,202
This is for you.

823
00:56:25,227 --> 00:56:26,710
What's that?

824
00:56:29,438 --> 00:56:31,032
This is awesome.

825
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:38,235
I wonder what she'll do now.

826
00:56:39,547 --> 00:56:41,055
That's what I was just thinking about.

827
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,547
Maybe I should have sent her home after all.

828
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:46,407
She's in danger.

829
00:56:46,563 --> 00:56:49,524
 I should've just grabbed her and taken her to the hospital.

830
00:56:50,235 --> 00:56:51,532
But she's not sick.

831
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:52,454
So, the police?

832
00:56:53,258 --> 00:56:55,282
I wonder if the police will give her protection.

833
00:56:55,485 --> 00:56:57,157
Does she have any relatives?

834
00:56:58,187 --> 00:56:59,976
And it's none of my business.

835
00:57:00,499 --> 00:57:02,757
What should we do...

836
00:57:03,515 --> 00:57:04,616
I feel worry.

837
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:06,523
Do you have any ideas?

838
00:57:14,288 --> 00:57:15,381
Excuse me.

839
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,702
You really look like a wife.

840
00:57:19,795 --> 00:57:22,749
we have been waiting for you for a long time.

841
00:57:22,842 --> 00:57:24,467
There's so much to talk about !

842
00:57:24,616 --> 00:57:28,405
But I'll start with Kasumi's story.
Why did you call me?

843
00:57:28,569 --> 00:57:30,077
I'll tell you later.

844
00:57:30,631 --> 00:57:33,194
As a matter of fact, Asako was at our home the other day.

845
00:57:33,389 --> 00:57:35,108
She finally showed up.

846
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:42,772
But I'm glad it didn't become a big problem.

847
00:57:43,147 --> 00:57:46,280
Not really.
I get nervous every morning when I read the paper.

848
00:57:46,366 --> 00:57:47,350
Why?

849
00:57:47,499 --> 00:57:49,670
I wonder why there's an article about Asako's suicide.

850
00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:51,866
You think too much.

851
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,655
I want to hear your story.

852
00:57:56,131 --> 00:58:00,483
It's Christmas Eve tonight.
I'm thinking of having an all-nighter with Maki.

853
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:01,992
all-nighter?

854
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:06,203
I'm really into him.

855
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:07,859
What do you mean?

856
00:58:10,562 --> 00:58:11,797
You can't sleep with him.

857
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,047
It's ok.

858
00:58:13,148 --> 00:58:13,859
That's bad.

859
00:58:14,304 --> 00:58:16,984
Why?

860
00:58:17,383 --> 00:58:21,859
Actually. I never told you this, but...

861
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:25,320
Don't be offended.

862
00:58:26,304 --> 00:58:29,453
Maki's been living with a woman for about a year.

863
00:58:29,968 --> 00:58:32,039
That's a lie.

864
00:58:32,578 --> 00:58:35,531
It's true.
The detective took full responsibility for the report

865
00:58:35,556 --> 00:58:39,484
You're a big talker, aren't you?
What right do you have to investigate Maki?

866
00:58:39,517 --> 00:58:40,757
Don't get me wrong.

867
00:58:40,782 --> 00:58:42,304
It's none of your business.

868
00:58:42,593 --> 00:58:46,234
If you have time to check on Maki-san, why don't you keep a closer eye on your own precious husband?

869
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,828
What's wrong with Kei-chan?

870
00:58:50,195 --> 00:58:52,734
I'm appalled.
When did Kasumi become such an idiot?

871
00:58:54,524 --> 00:59:00,868
That Asako didn't know about your marriage until recently.
That's because Kei-chan acted like he was single.

872
00:59:01,087 --> 00:59:05,532
And the reason she didn't kill herself after you yelled at her...
Kei-chan talked her into getting back together with you.

873
00:59:06,087 --> 00:59:07,532
I don't think he would do that.

874
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:08,696
You think so?

875
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:10,009
Yeah.

876
00:59:10,524 --> 00:59:12,501
He has come home every day since we got married.

877
00:59:12,728 --> 00:59:16,798
How stupid can you be?
The other day Kasumi called and said he's been working late.

878
00:59:17,298 --> 00:59:22,368
Lately, lunchtime affairs are all the rage among office workers.

879
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:25,571
You make him eat eggs every day and you feel stupid.

880
00:59:26,235 --> 00:59:32,548
Maki said your sister was very close to Kei-chan when she was single.

881
00:59:32,876 --> 00:59:36,095
You two are a man and a woman, so be careful.

882
00:59:36,462 --> 00:59:38,595
You never know, you might have enemies among your own people.

883
00:59:46,459 --> 00:59:47,139
You want some?

884
00:59:47,342 --> 00:59:48,482
No thanks.

885
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:50,342
Just one cup.

886
00:59:50,367 --> 00:59:51,607
That's enough.

887
00:59:53,714 --> 00:59:55,066
You want some?

888
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:10,110
You are very black-hearted.
I won't be fooled.

889
01:00:14,524 --> 01:00:18,649
I think it's strange to have a party outside on Christmas Eve.

890
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:23,391
In America, Christmas Eve is a family affair.

891
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:25,399
Please give me more wine.

892
01:00:25,532 --> 01:00:30,040
It's fine to celebrate at home. But if you drink too much, you won't get anywhere.

893
01:00:44,634 --> 01:00:46,181
I have to go.

894
01:00:46,408 --> 01:00:48,548
Take that.

895
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:50,760
Take that.

896
01:00:50,900 --> 01:00:52,283
One for Kasumi.

897
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,361
For Kasumi, too?

898
01:00:56,830 --> 01:01:01,580
Because I'm really sorry to Kasumi for doing this.

899
01:01:16,776 --> 01:01:18,776
Won't you dance?

900
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,550
Let's dance.

901
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:23,112
I don't want.

902
01:01:24,542 --> 01:01:25,182
What's wrong?

903
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:26,768
Are you sick?

904
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,018
Are you sick?

905
01:01:29,604 --> 01:01:31,221
I'm not.

906
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:34,206
Anyway, let's play a record.

907
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:35,987
I don't like it without music.

908
01:01:36,471 --> 01:01:38,495
Akiko, put on a record.

909
01:01:39,448 --> 01:01:41,667
I have a record in my room.

910
01:01:58,810 --> 01:02:01,685
Please think about it seriously.

911
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:30,500
I don't know why he laughed.

912
01:02:31,453 --> 01:02:33,117
I don't like the idea of he laughing at hisself.

913
01:02:34,312 --> 01:02:37,680
I'm sure he's just trying to impress some other girl when I'm not looking.

914
01:02:43,476 --> 01:02:44,242
I'm off.

915
01:02:46,117 --> 01:02:48,132
I knew it. You misunderstood me, didn't you?

916
01:02:48,157 --> 01:02:48,835
Misunderstood what?

917
01:02:48,945 --> 01:02:50,179
Your sis worried about you.

918
01:02:50,453 --> 01:02:53,898
She said you were suspicious of us.
I told her that's not true.

919
01:02:54,320 --> 01:02:58,523
And she says, "You can't be so optimistic.
She said, "You've got to really think about it.

920
01:02:58,835 --> 01:03:02,593
And then you come down the stairs... and you put on a record.
Were you crying?

921
01:03:02,812 --> 01:03:04,273
You'll be late.

922
01:03:04,374 --> 01:03:05,687
Okay, bye.

923
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:08,882
I'm off.

924
01:03:39,051 --> 01:03:39,824
Excuse me.

925
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:43,871
This is the candy I forgot to give you last night.

926
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,254
You scared me.

927
01:03:46,972 --> 01:03:48,566
Come in.

928
01:03:48,605 --> 01:03:52,715
I was told not to talk to you long.

929
01:03:53,918 --> 01:03:55,066
I get it.

930
01:03:57,191 --> 01:03:59,738
Your husband has been coming home late lately.

931
01:04:01,222 --> 01:04:01,839
Why?

932
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:08,495
There are rumors that he has an affair with a woman at the bar.

933
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:12,251
Is that true?

934
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:17,454
Oops..
But I thought I'd better warn you.

935
01:04:18,883 --> 01:04:20,797
I'm leaving.

936
01:04:21,305 --> 01:04:25,118
Don't you dare tell your mother what you just said.

937
01:04:25,748 --> 01:04:27,068
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

938
01:04:52,026 --> 01:04:53,409
That's what I thought.

939
01:04:55,565 --> 01:04:56,807
There's a phone call for you.

940
01:04:57,026 --> 01:04:58,276
Thank you very much.

941
01:04:59,151 --> 01:05:00,807
Kasumi? It's me.

942
01:05:01,573 --> 01:05:03,401
I'm going to be home a little late today.

943
01:05:03,729 --> 01:05:06,706
You said you'd be home early.

944
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:07,893
Why?

945
01:05:08,268 --> 01:05:11,174
Because I have to take care of something.

946
01:05:11,542 --> 01:05:14,034
What errands? It's not for the company, is it?

947
01:05:14,635 --> 01:05:15,956
What kind of errands?

948
01:05:16,127 --> 01:05:18,135
It's none of your business.

949
01:05:21,987 --> 01:05:24,619
Ok I get it...

950
01:05:34,523 --> 01:05:35,289
Who?

951
01:05:36,343 --> 01:05:37,132
It's me.

952
01:05:38,578 --> 01:05:39,460
KASUMI

953
01:05:41,257 --> 01:05:42,023
Come in.

954
01:05:49,927 --> 01:05:51,286
I just thought I'd stop by.

955
01:05:52,364 --> 01:05:54,442
Going on a trip or something?

956
01:05:56,356 --> 01:05:58,255
Yes, with Chieko.

957
01:05:59,848 --> 01:06:01,302
So Keiichi will be lonely.

958
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,333
I'm currently working on this, so please wait a moment.

959
01:06:09,973 --> 01:06:14,591
I think he'd be happier without me.

960
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:22,345
Am I intruding?

961
01:06:23,916 --> 01:06:24,595
Why?

962
01:06:25,025 --> 01:06:26,533
But you keep looking at your watch.

963
01:06:26,775 --> 01:06:30,736
No, it's time for the stock market broadcast.

964
01:06:30,892 --> 01:06:35,564
I bought my first stock yesterday.
I thought it might go down.

965
01:06:38,274 --> 01:06:39,532
I see.

966
01:06:48,881 --> 01:06:52,725
You have something to worry about?

967
01:06:55,537 --> 01:06:59,709
That's what I thought.
I knew you were crying last night.

968
01:07:00,545 --> 01:07:01,514
I was worried about you.

969
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:04,694
I was doubting your relationship.

970
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:11,967
I knew it.
It was hard for me.  Because I like you.

971
01:07:13,233 --> 01:07:14,459
I'm sorry.

972
01:07:16,725 --> 01:07:19,069
I'm glad we got it all straightened out.

973
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:22,264
You know what?

974
01:07:24,577 --> 01:07:26,452
Kei-chan seems to be having an affair with someone.

975
01:07:27,647 --> 01:07:28,475
with who?

976
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:32,709
With a bar girl.
Your bros saw them.

977
01:07:33,537 --> 01:07:36,389
Your bros said that last night?

978
01:07:38,295 --> 01:07:39,280
I can't believe it.

979
01:07:39,506 --> 01:07:44,272
What did your brother say about her?

980
01:07:44,913 --> 01:07:50,561
He said he sometimes saw them together at a bar in Ginza these days.

981
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,053
What bar?

982
01:07:52,913 --> 01:07:53,905
I didn't ask that much.

983
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:54,842
What's she like?

984
01:07:55,757 --> 01:07:57,303
I heard she had long hair.

985
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,194
She must be Asako.

986
01:08:02,108 --> 01:08:05,616
Is she tall and thin?

987
01:08:05,780 --> 01:08:07,694
Yes.
Your brother said so too?

988
01:08:09,327 --> 01:08:10,303
No..

989
01:08:10,913 --> 01:08:12,608
So you saw her?

990
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:14,038
Yes.

991
01:08:14,374 --> 01:08:15,444
When?
Where?

992
01:08:16,233 --> 01:08:21,428
I only saw them together in Ginza 10 days ago.

993
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:24,233
That's what I thought.

994
01:08:26,014 --> 01:08:28,030
Asako's turned to be bar girl.

995
01:08:30,491 --> 01:08:31,663
Please don't hate me.

996
01:08:32,022 --> 01:08:38,374
I never thought I'd be able to live with you for so long.

997
01:08:39,428 --> 01:08:42,132
I played a strange role this time.

998
01:08:43,108 --> 01:08:46,186
I think you are lucky to have a friend like Sawai.

999
01:08:46,905 --> 01:08:47,702
Thank you very much.

1000
01:08:48,608 --> 01:08:49,194
I was sorry.

1001
01:08:50,116 --> 01:08:54,178
Never mind.
I told you I didn't care.

1002
01:09:10,776 --> 01:09:11,713
Welcome.

1003
01:09:14,730 --> 01:09:20,894
Ms. Asako, who used to work here, where is she working now?

1004
01:09:21,058 --> 01:09:25,027
She's  still working here.
Asako, you have a guest.

1005
01:09:28,651 --> 01:09:30,776
Oh Sawai's wife.

1006
01:09:32,713 --> 01:09:34,666
Are you going on a trip?

1007
01:09:35,009 --> 01:09:37,400
I have something to say to you.

1008
01:09:37,425 --> 01:09:42,994
I'm just about to go home too.
Let's have a coffee.

1009
01:09:43,533 --> 01:09:45,612
Hold on.

1010
01:09:54,010 --> 01:09:57,198
I did meet your husband 10 days ago.

1011
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:03,940
We came to this coffee shop after work.
I had something to consult with him

1012
01:10:07,192 --> 01:10:08,527
What do you want to consult with me?

1013
01:10:08,752 --> 01:10:10,979
I'm thinking of getting married.

1014
01:10:11,352 --> 01:10:13,192
With who?

1015
01:10:14,177 --> 01:10:16,510
Mr. Kawakami, an architectural engineer.

1016
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:21,630
He didn't get married until he was 35 because he was busy working on the dam.

1017
01:10:22,921 --> 01:10:24,375
He is a regular customer of my shop.

1018
01:10:25,195 --> 01:10:27,601
It's been 3 months since I met him.

1019
01:10:28,175 --> 01:10:30,689
At first I was dating him because I was lonely.

1020
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:34,248
I went to your apartment the other day,right?

1021
01:10:35,029 --> 01:10:40,276
At that moment I felt you were no longer my concern.

1022
01:10:41,230 --> 01:10:44,490
After that, I started to understand Kawakami's charm.

1023
01:10:45,485 --> 01:10:48,678
So I decided to restart.

1024
01:10:49,275 --> 01:10:54,042
I'm thinking of telling him everything about you before I respond with his proposal.

1025
01:10:54,552 --> 01:10:55,785
About me?

1026
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:58,756
I don't care but...

1027
01:10:59,359 --> 01:11:01,079
I think you should not tell him.

1028
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:04,161
That's a common response.

1029
01:11:04,922 --> 01:11:07,668
But I don't think it should be hidden.

1030
01:11:07,925 --> 01:11:10,125
I want him to know my true feelings.

1031
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:11,527
I know how you feel but..

1032
01:11:11,802 --> 01:11:13,055
What do you think?

1033
01:11:13,087 --> 01:11:14,722
I think you should not tell him...

1034
01:11:15,372 --> 01:11:17,978
I have no idea.

1035
01:11:18,085 --> 01:11:21,518
I have to reply to him soon.

1036
01:11:21,725 --> 01:11:22,998
It's too sudden.

1037
01:11:23,218 --> 01:11:30,477
I was very confused and decided to talk to you.

1038
01:11:30,882 --> 01:11:32,195
What do you think?

1039
01:11:33,142 --> 01:11:35,515
Oh my god..

1040
01:11:36,939 --> 01:11:37,586
Oh.

1041
01:11:39,734 --> 01:11:43,817
I couldn't wait for you to reply.

1042
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:47,270
He’s My male friend,Sawai.

1043
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:48,821
I'm Kawakami.

1044
01:11:48,908 --> 01:11:49,681
Nice to meet you.

1045
01:11:50,496 --> 01:11:51,489
I'm leaving.

1046
01:11:51,522 --> 01:11:52,968
Please stay here.

1047
01:11:53,069 --> 01:11:55,389
But I'm on the way working.

1048
01:11:56,163 --> 01:11:57,083
See you.

1049
01:12:03,155 --> 01:12:04,308
He looks nice.

1050
01:12:05,312 --> 01:12:08,652
I want to tell you something before I reply to you.

1051
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:09,925
What?

1052
01:12:10,388 --> 01:12:12,735
About my past.

1053
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:17,074
Hold on.
I think you should not tell me...

1054
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,695
I'm not going to marry your past.

1055
01:12:22,115 --> 01:12:23,748
I'm going to marry you from now on.

1056
01:12:24,271 --> 01:12:29,238
You don't need to tell me about your past, and I don't need to listen.

1057
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:33,548
I want to hear your reply about marriage.

1058
01:12:34,208 --> 01:12:35,035
Kawakami...

1059
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:46,554
Oh I see.

1060
01:12:48,608 --> 01:12:50,901
He's so nice.

1061
01:12:51,283 --> 01:12:53,263
Yes he is.

1062
01:12:53,752 --> 01:12:56,172
He is the most wonderful man in the world.

1063
01:12:58,298 --> 01:12:59,272
What's wrong?

1064
01:13:00,986 --> 01:13:04,326
Do you think this bag is a travel bag?

1065
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,527
I left the letter and left the house.

1066
01:13:11,069 --> 01:13:12,729
It seems Kei is having an affair with someone.

1067
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:13,522
With whom?

1068
01:13:14,255 --> 01:13:15,562
A bar girl.

1069
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:20,636
I thought that woman was you.

1070
01:13:21,175 --> 01:13:23,655
I heard that the woman has long hair.

1071
01:13:24,187 --> 01:13:26,940
I thought I'd give him to you.

1072
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:29,527
No way.
Kei-chan is nice.

1073
01:13:30,130 --> 01:13:38,375
I don't think your husband would ever cheat under any circumstances.

1074
01:13:39,101 --> 01:13:41,094
He really loves you.

1075
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:45,580
Don't doubt him and go home quickly.

1076
01:13:46,721 --> 01:13:48,588
There were 2 people who saw them.

1077
01:13:49,394 --> 01:13:50,954
At Ginza and bar.

1078
01:13:54,729 --> 01:13:57,876
I'm sorry I wasn't able to meet you on Christmas Eve because I was busy.

1079
01:13:59,184 --> 01:14:01,064
I heard that you live with a woman.

1080
01:14:01,835 --> 01:14:02,528
Really?

1081
01:14:02,701 --> 01:14:03,501
I’m sorry.

1082
01:14:03,601 --> 01:14:05,308
Just as it was written in a women's magazine.

1083
01:14:05,334 --> 01:14:05,841
I’m sorry.

1084
01:14:05,866 --> 01:14:09,784
A woman can only love one man, but a man can love many women.

1085
01:14:09,888 --> 01:14:12,214
A man can only love one woman too.

1086
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:12,694
You are lair.

1087
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:14,236
At least I am.

1088
01:14:14,491 --> 01:14:17,798
I was thinking of breaking up with my girlfriend and proposing to you.

1089
01:14:17,950 --> 01:14:20,037
Don't make any more excuses

1090
01:14:20,271 --> 01:14:22,365
You want to have an affair during your lunch break, right?

1091
01:14:22,411 --> 01:14:22,985
What do you mean?

1092
01:14:23,071 --> 01:14:23,791
This is written.

1093
01:14:23,890 --> 01:14:24,417
In a women's magazine?

1094
01:14:24,444 --> 01:14:25,357
In a weekly magazine

1095
01:14:25,382 --> 01:14:28,138
Do you believe everything you read in magazines?

1096
01:14:28,163 --> 01:14:30,645
I believe it.
Kei might be cheating too.

1097
01:14:30,711 --> 01:14:32,758
No way,
Sawai is good man.

1098
01:14:32,994 --> 01:14:38,354
He's pretending to be my girl's lover right now for me.

1099
01:14:38,593 --> 01:14:41,460
He also lent me money.

1100
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:43,841
Really?

1101
01:14:44,418 --> 01:14:47,164
Sawai told me to make you happy.

1102
01:14:48,059 --> 01:14:51,492
Oh my god.
This is all the fault of the women's magazines and the weeklies.

1103
01:14:51,585 --> 01:14:51,945
What's wrong?

1104
01:14:52,038 --> 01:14:55,185
I have to go apologize to her right away.
Come with me.

1105
01:15:00,146 --> 01:15:02,759
I have to apologize you.

1106
01:15:13,541 --> 01:15:19,901
Dear Keiichi,
I'm going on a trip so don't look for me. Kasumi.

1107
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:32,037
Hello?

1108
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,370
Oh Keiichi?

1109
01:15:36,863 --> 01:15:38,089
That's what I thought.

1110
01:15:39,946 --> 01:15:40,859
Actually..

1111
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:46,769
She's an idiot.

1112
01:15:47,195 --> 01:15:49,669
What should I do if she commits suicide?

1113
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:51,597
No way.

1114
01:15:52,382 --> 01:15:55,436
I'll call my dad and tell him about it.
I'll be there soon.

1115
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:57,987
Stay strong.

1116
01:16:13,058 --> 01:16:13,758
Kasumi.

1117
01:16:14,677 --> 01:16:16,724
why couldn't you believe me?

1118
01:16:17,114 --> 01:16:18,754
Get your hands off of me!

1119
01:16:22,805 --> 01:16:24,658
why did you doubt me?

1120
01:16:25,353 --> 01:16:27,866
There are many reasons.
You withdrew 100,000 yen.

1121
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:31,923
I lent the money to Maki.

1122
01:16:35,393 --> 01:16:37,093
Why did you smile when you looked in the mirror this morning?

1123
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:39,686
Did I smile when I looked in the mirror this morning?

1124
01:16:39,896 --> 01:16:41,036
you were laughing.

1125
01:16:41,156 --> 01:16:42,049
I don't remember about that.

1126
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,918
you were laughing.

1127
01:16:54,051 --> 01:16:54,958
Ouch.

1128
01:17:02,187 --> 01:17:06,327
It's true that I lent Maki 100,000 yen.
He wanted to marry Chieko, so he gave her to her as alimony.

1129
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,948
He had a girlfriend who lived with him.

1130
01:17:09,649 --> 01:17:12,856
What I didn't tell you about it.
I thought you would tell Chieko-san.

1131
01:17:15,292 --> 01:17:17,126
I met Maki and Ochiyo.

1132
01:17:17,747 --> 01:17:18,807
I've heard a lot about you too.

1133
01:17:19,943 --> 01:17:20,883
You're nice man.

1134
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:22,660
What's the hell?

1135
01:17:22,866 --> 01:17:27,659
I want to live a quiet and peaceful life.

1136
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:29,706
Really?

1137
01:17:31,352 --> 01:17:32,606
Yes for sure.

1138
01:17:33,463 --> 01:17:35,703
You are a very ordinary woman.

1139
01:17:36,756 --> 01:17:38,749
Yes I am.

1140
01:17:43,926 --> 01:17:46,399
I don't wanna stay in the corner.

1141
01:17:59,366 --> 01:18:00,186
Oh my god.

1142
01:18:22,327 --> 01:18:22,880
Oh.

1143
01:18:24,256 --> 01:18:24,790
Oh.

1144
01:18:26,796 --> 01:18:27,737
You guys too?

1145
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:38,683
Congratulations.

1146
01:18:47,312 --> 01:18:55,362
THE END

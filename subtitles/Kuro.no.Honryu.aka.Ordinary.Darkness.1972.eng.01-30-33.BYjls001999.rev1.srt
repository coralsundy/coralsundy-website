2
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:25,094
This is a complete marriage fraud

3
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:30,531
He said he would get married with her for three years, but he changed his mind

4
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:34,625
Let me explain what fraud is

5
00:00:35,008 --> 00:00:38,156
Fraud is when someone cheats you out of your property or things.

6
00:00:38,852 --> 00:00:41,680
Did she get the money deceived by the man?

7
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:44,680
She hasn't taken money

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,117
She lost the most precious thing in her life to that man.

9
00:00:48,249 --> 00:00:54,593
In that case, you can file a civil claim against him for alimony.

10
00:00:55,812 --> 00:01:01,804
Decide if you really want to sue him or settle him

11
00:01:01,944 --> 00:01:03,929
Then let me know

12
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:05,687
You know what

13
00:01:06,694 --> 00:01:11,069
In this case it is difficult to expect legal sanctions

14
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:12,827
Anyway

15
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:15,554
Please be careful not to do this again

16
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:20,562
Be careful that your daughter is not deceived by men in the future.

17
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:25,514
What I want to say is, You should have an eye for men.

18
00:01:26,202 --> 00:01:27,366
Sorry I'm busy

19
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,171
What should we do after all?

20
00:01:29,593 --> 00:01:32,593
Decide if you really want to sue him or settle him

21
00:01:32,773 --> 00:01:33,921
Then I will take care of you

22
00:01:43,616 --> 00:01:46,804
It's been a while since I've had a visitor, but it's like someone came to me for life advice.

23
00:01:47,546 --> 00:01:49,843
They should be on a TV show.

24
00:01:51,116 --> 00:01:51,773
Sensei

25
00:01:52,343 --> 00:01:53,632
About the case

26
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:55,882
Can't I quit the office yet?

27
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,257
Wait for a whole

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,234
Wait until someone else joins the company

29
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:15,428
The Black Torrent

30
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:44,390
Mmm...

31
00:03:54,249 --> 00:03:55,030
Ah...

32
00:03:57,898 --> 00:03:58,694
Ah...

33
00:04:00,632 --> 00:04:01,288
Ah...

34
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,257
Urrrr...

35
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:18,273
Calm judgment for men

36
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,538
Have a cognitive eye

37
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:24,593
It's like a textbook

38
00:04:28,015 --> 00:04:32,093
But I got this result

39
00:04:32,718 --> 00:04:33,288
But

40
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,741
I'm not going to end up with such a poor lawyer

41
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:37,015
You want to say like that?

42
00:04:38,124 --> 00:04:40,546
I've been hearing that line from you for three years.

43
00:04:45,843 --> 00:04:49,366
You want to be a first-class lawyer

44
00:04:53,366 --> 00:04:58,038
And if given the chance, You'd like to take Dr. Wakamiya's daughter as your wife.

45
00:05:00,663 --> 00:05:01,655
Takeshi-san

46
00:05:03,132 --> 00:05:05,882
Lately I'm thinking like that

47
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:10,632
There is no future even if one woman works at a law firm

48
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:13,811
I want to have a small clothing store in Roppongi

49
00:05:16,327 --> 00:05:17,390
But it's not good

50
00:05:18,475 --> 00:05:20,030
It doesn't make sense to be with you

51
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:21,288
Let's go home

52
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,788
Today I got a call from the lawyer's association

53
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:25,984
Yes

54
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:29,210
It was a contact of the public defender

55
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,866
I will see them tomorrow

56
00:05:42,054 --> 00:05:44,671
It'll be a boring incident anyway.

57
00:05:54,304 --> 00:05:55,773
This is a troublesome problem

58
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:56,491
Yeah

59
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,140
Why you have come here?

60
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,913
I have no work

61
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:01,577
I'll be a court-appointed attorney and make some extra money.

62
00:06:02,554 --> 00:06:03,124
To where?

63
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,687
The district court

64
00:06:03,788 --> 00:06:04,648
Ah sensei

65
00:06:05,109 --> 00:06:06,851
I also go to the district court

66
00:06:07,023 --> 00:06:07,827
Leave it to you

67
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:08,437
See you then

68
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:17,046
Hi

69
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:17,554
Good morning

70
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,827
Wakamiya sensei is here

71
00:06:18,984 --> 00:06:19,538
He is here?

72
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,085
Yes

73
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:22,632
His daughter too

74
00:06:28,413 --> 00:06:29,460
Good morning

75
00:06:29,655 --> 00:06:30,468
Where is Wakamiya sensei ?

76
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:31,905
He is in the back

77
00:06:39,468 --> 00:06:40,460
Ah,Sensei

78
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,616
It's been a whole

79
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:42,312
Hi

80
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:45,132
Please come to Denenchofu once in a while

81
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:45,663
Yes

82
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:49,554
I think this case is difficult

83
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,898
But our lawyer association has to take charge of this case

84
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:56,515
That's right

85
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,984
If it is a public defender, the reward is small

86
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,851
It would be nice if someone handle this case...

87
00:07:05,499 --> 00:07:06,155
Ms.

88
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:08,249
What is the case he just said?

89
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:09,835
This is..

90
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:13,413
This is the Abe group of companies incident that appeared in the newspaper a month ago.

91
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,882
Abe group of companies?

92
00:07:26,554 --> 00:07:29,851
He says the case is a no-win proposition.

93
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:33,405
This is an obvious murder case

94
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:39,937
This case appeals

95
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:45,530
Robbery Murder Fujie Kaizuka

96
00:07:46,218 --> 00:07:47,694
25 years old

97
00:07:48,148 --> 00:07:49,171
Arraignment

98
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:55,632
The accused was around 6:00 pm on May 15, 1972.

99
00:07:56,194 --> 00:08:01,061
In the mountains of Okuishi-cho, Nishitama-gun, Tokyo

100
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:07,217
She invited Tatsuhiko Abe, the head of the department, whom she happened to know.

101
00:08:08,327 --> 00:08:10,859
She had sex with him and demanded money

102
00:08:11,335 --> 00:08:15,804
She found out he had a lot of money.
So she wanted to rob him of money

103
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,812
She robbed him of money and pushed him out of the valley

104
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:23,546
She killed him with it

105
00:08:24,453 --> 00:08:25,835
For the reasons

106
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:29,070
It's only fair that the defendant receive the maximum penalty.

107
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:30,757
I am not guilty

108
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:32,500
I didn't do anything

109
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,460
And Article 46 of the Penal Code

110
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,905
I was on that day...

111
00:08:36,992 --> 00:08:40,843
That day was the evening of May 16th when Abe was killed?

112
00:08:41,617 --> 00:08:43,179
Defendant is sentenced to death

113
00:08:43,906 --> 00:08:44,601
Yes

114
00:08:45,718 --> 00:08:50,921
I went to buy a camera film in front of the station for work at the inn that day

115
00:08:52,296 --> 00:08:53,703
The time was just 5 o'clock

116
00:08:59,132 --> 00:09:03,375
Our cook was on holiday that day and the inn didn't take any guests.

117
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:25,125
It's about 2 km to the station

118
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,320
I arrived in front of the station around 5:30

119
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:37,328
Two films, please.

120
00:09:37,353 --> 00:09:38,125
Yes

121
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:52,210
Here are they

122
00:09:52,335 --> 00:09:52,789
How much?

123
00:09:53,054 --> 00:09:54,242
800 yen please

124
00:09:54,267 --> 00:09:55,531
Can I have a receipt?

125
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:55,937
OK

126
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:02,945
Here it is

127
00:10:03,359 --> 00:10:04,296
Thank you

128
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:07,406
Here is the change, 200yen

129
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:08,273
Thank you

130
00:10:08,515 --> 00:10:09,257
Thank you

131
00:10:09,687 --> 00:10:10,804
Are you Fujie?

132
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:17,773
Are you Shinku-inn's Fujie,right?

133
00:10:19,031 --> 00:10:19,648
Yes...

134
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:21,882
You don't remember me?

135
00:10:22,382 --> 00:10:23,156
You are cold

136
00:10:24,647 --> 00:10:26,975
Oh..You stayed us before..

137
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,617
Yes, I'm Abe

138
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:30,851
Your inn is closed today?

139
00:10:31,054 --> 00:10:34,773
Right,There is also road construction and Our cook is holiday today

140
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,069
I see

141
00:10:36,234 --> 00:10:37,242
That's too bad

142
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:38,210
Where are you going?

143
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:39,781
To Sekiote. it's far?

144
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,757
It takes 5mins by car

145
00:10:42,093 --> 00:10:44,031
I see, then I will go on foot

146
00:10:44,179 --> 00:10:44,562
Really?

147
00:10:45,203 --> 00:10:47,195
I'm on a diet

148
00:10:47,539 --> 00:10:48,632
I need to walk

149
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,671
So I have come here by train

150
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:53,460
Can you show me around?

151
00:10:53,796 --> 00:10:55,265
Ok no problem

152
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,867
Then did you go back the way you came?

153
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,046
Yes

154
00:11:43,484 --> 00:11:46,773
I was separated from Mr. Abe in front of the suspension bridge

155
00:11:47,484 --> 00:11:48,171
Wait

156
00:11:50,062 --> 00:11:50,625
Good

157
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:52,664
Let's review it

158
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:57,562
This is the Shinju-inn where you have worked

159
00:11:58,796 --> 00:12:03,546
You headed towards the station from here

160
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:07,195
You went to a souvenir shop in front of the station to buy a camera film

161
00:12:07,953 --> 00:12:09,632
The train arrived while you were waiting

162
00:12:09,992 --> 00:12:12,773
This train arrived at 5:35

163
00:12:13,101 --> 00:12:15,031
You also checked the time by the store's clock

164
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:16,710
This is correct so far

165
00:12:17,726 --> 00:12:19,476
You paid and got the receipt

166
00:12:20,226 --> 00:12:23,882
It took 5 minutes in the meantime,so 5:20

167
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,039
Then you met with Abe right away

168
00:12:26,671 --> 00:12:28,187
How long did you talk with him?

169
00:12:29,593 --> 00:12:32,625
I think 4-5 mins at most

170
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,234
So let's say 5:45...

171
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,546
Then you went to the five-way road directly?

172
00:12:40,507 --> 00:12:45,289
So It took 15,6 mins to go back to the five-way road

173
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,054
You arrived here around 6:00

174
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:50,203
You turned right here

175
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:51,718
You went to until the suspension bridge

176
00:12:52,796 --> 00:12:55,703
There is about 200 meters from this suspension bridge to the five-way road.

177
00:12:55,929 --> 00:12:57,398
Even if you walked slowly, it took 5 mins

178
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:00,468
So.. at 6:05

179
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:03,453
You were supposed to be in front of the suspension bridge

180
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,265
You separated with Abe here, right?

181
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,250
Yes

182
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,140
Then?

183
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,883
As I said at Police station

184
00:13:13,789 --> 00:13:16,765
After you saw him off, you were under the bridge

185
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,961
You were under the bank

186
00:13:19,031 --> 00:13:20,101
It's true

187
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:24,375
If you stay under this suspension bridge for half an hour, I'm sure someone was watching you.

188
00:13:24,531 --> 00:13:26,805
I was sitting behind a tree

189
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:29,469
So no one noticed me

190
00:13:30,531 --> 00:13:33,187
Police suspect this 30 minutes

191
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,421
In the last 30 minutes you invited Abe to have sex, robbed him of money and killed him

192
00:13:40,768 --> 00:13:43,541
You really didn't go to this murder scene?

193
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,440
How many times I repeat this..

194
00:13:48,213 --> 00:13:48,799
OK

195
00:13:50,143 --> 00:13:53,244
You were under the suspension bridge

196
00:13:54,635 --> 00:13:57,205
Thinking about various things

197
00:13:58,908 --> 00:14:00,432
What you had a hard time until today

198
00:14:01,401 --> 00:14:02,698
What you will do in the future

199
00:14:04,065 --> 00:14:06,463
You were thinking about that

200
00:14:08,151 --> 00:14:08,666
Is that right?

201
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,854
Then you got up and tried to go home

202
00:14:15,924 --> 00:14:18,541
That's where Abe's fountain pen fell,right?

203
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,104
Yes

204
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:25,026
The fountain pen had an initial called TA dug.

205
00:14:25,401 --> 00:14:27,651
I quickly realized that it was Mr. Abe's

206
00:14:30,158 --> 00:14:31,674
Then It started raining

207
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,471
At 6:55 you returned to the inn in the rain

208
00:14:35,924 --> 00:14:39,198
The person at the inn was checking the time because your return was late

209
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:40,853
Is that right?

210
00:14:42,237 --> 00:14:45,901
My clothes were wet so I went back to my room and changed my clothes

211
00:14:46,205 --> 00:14:48,862
Your colleague Sumiko Morimoto saw it,right?

212
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,877
Speaking of what, Sumie returned here in hurry

213
00:14:54,299 --> 00:14:57,073
She was out of breath and her face was deep blue

214
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:02,190
She changed into jeans when I entered the waiting room

215
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:07,877
There was a wet kimono in the corner of the room and she had her hair fixed

216
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,963
She never answered whatever I asked

217
00:15:11,533 --> 00:15:13,432
She has a gloomy personality

218
00:15:14,494 --> 00:15:16,651
We searched this room

219
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:20,198
Abe's fountain pen was found in the accused's dressing box

220
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:23,377
We found 50,000 yen in her handbag

221
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:29,065
The accused says that this 50,000 yen is the saved money

222
00:15:29,565 --> 00:15:32,260
I think it's strange to put a lot of money in a handbag

223
00:15:33,143 --> 00:15:37,268
Normally, people keep money they don't use in a savings account.

224
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:43,135
Defendant during 30 minutes of crime time

225
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:46,346
She says she killed time under the bridge

226
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:48,549
But there is no proof

227
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:54,580
She says she got wet in the rain and washes all her clothes that day,

228
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:57,323
including her underwear

229
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:03,994
This is an act to eliminate semen after the accused has sex with Abe

230
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:07,565
This is clearly evidence destruction

231
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:19,557
What do you think of yesterday's prosecutor's opening statement?

232
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:22,510
Abe fell from here

233
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:25,401
Fumie Kaizuka didn't come here but

234
00:16:26,112 --> 00:16:29,104
The prosecution is assuming she has come

235
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,552
The only evidence on the prosecution side is Abe's fountain pen in her handbag

236
00:16:36,482 --> 00:16:38,568
Something is wrong with the prosecution's statement

237
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:43,591
Why did the prosecution prosecute without complete evidence?

238
00:16:44,693 --> 00:16:45,958
That is the problem

239
00:16:48,396 --> 00:16:52,005
Mr. Abe's company's political contribution is hundreds of millions of yen per year.

240
00:16:53,075 --> 00:16:55,919
I don't think the prosecution has moved because of that

241
00:16:56,802 --> 00:17:00,083
They treat the dead Abe as a completely well-meaning person

242
00:17:00,474 --> 00:17:03,958
They have decided that there is no possibility of suicide or negligence

243
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,778
They have decided that the criminal is Fujie

244
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,099
Let me review it

245
00:17:12,646 --> 00:17:15,896
I try to find out the mistakes on the prosecution side

246
00:17:22,357 --> 00:17:28,153
Next,The accused's fountain pen is the only physical evidence

247
00:17:28,551 --> 00:17:33,622
Now,Judiciary Prosecutor's Fifth Statement of Statement

248
00:17:33,724 --> 00:17:37,841
And I would like you to recall the transcript of the first trial.

249
00:17:38,966 --> 00:17:44,083
The accused guided him to the suspension bridge as requested by the victim

250
00:17:45,044 --> 00:17:49,732
The accused explained the directions to the inn where the victim stayed here.

251
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:55,403
Victim put out a fountain pen and wrote directions in a notebook

252
00:17:57,232 --> 00:18:00,364
He was focused on explaining with her

253
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,364
He could have accidentally dropped his fountain pen.

254
00:18:04,967 --> 00:18:11,991
What I want to say is The fountain pen may not be involved in crime

255
00:18:12,936 --> 00:18:13,921
And also

256
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:18,967
The accused has brought the fountain pen back to the inn

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,108
As a criminal's psychology

258
00:18:23,553 --> 00:18:28,709
Psychologically proves that you brought back what you used for the crime

259
00:18:29,905 --> 00:18:33,006
Even if it's expensive

260
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:36,342
The criminal expected the police to pursue

261
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:40,834
It's normal psychology not to take those things home.

262
00:18:42,483 --> 00:18:47,780
Secondly, the prosecution says that the defendant is guilty of a crime

263
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:52,092
Round trip time from the inn to the station

264
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:56,155
Well...at normal speed

265
00:18:57,295 --> 00:19:00,522
It takes about 1 hour for the round trip

266
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:03,600
Look at the map

267
00:19:04,889 --> 00:19:06,545
According to the prosecution's claim

268
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:11,491
It took her 1 hour and 55 minutes to get to this store and back.

269
00:19:11,694 --> 00:19:14,444
55 minutes is excess time

270
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,655
Defendant and victim arrived at the bridge at 6:03

271
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:22,803
They crossed the suspension bridge and turned right on Third Road

272
00:19:23,116 --> 00:19:24,678
And they arrived at the crime scene

273
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:29,663
It takes 12 minutes at normal speed from the bridge to the crime scene

274
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:34,803
The distance from the crime scene to the inn is about 2 km

275
00:19:34,881 --> 00:19:35,780
so I takes 30mins

276
00:19:36,256 --> 00:19:37,022
Therefore

277
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:42,163
We have to deduct 42 minutes from that excess time of 52 minutes

278
00:19:42,499 --> 00:19:43,350
It's gonna be 13 mins

279
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:49,366
During these 13 minutes, the accused must have sex with the accused and take the money.

280
00:19:49,874 --> 00:19:51,749
And She had to push him into the valley

281
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,178
This can't be done in 13 minutes

282
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:58,327
Moreover The accused wore a kimono on the day

283
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,654
So She walked slower than normal speed

284
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,092
It's common to think that way

285
00:20:04,647 --> 00:20:08,467
The 13 minutes used to commit the crime will be further reduced.

286
00:20:08,866 --> 00:20:10,631
More important than that

287
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:15,374
That the defendant said he left the victim on a bridge.

288
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:16,530
Judge

289
00:20:17,194 --> 00:20:18,616
Prosecutor Please

290
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:25,358
The defense attorney said the victim left the defendant at the foot of the bridge.

291
00:20:25,842 --> 00:20:29,170
Attorneys claim not to hand over to the crime scene

292
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:33,811
We have witnesses on that matter

293
00:20:49,163 --> 00:20:52,788
This is a floor plan near the site.
Where do you live?

294
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:55,999
I live in front of the suspension bridge

295
00:20:56,749 --> 00:20:59,170
Did you meet the accused on the day of the case?

296
00:20:59,647 --> 00:21:01,170
I didn't but

297
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,600
I saw her

298
00:21:02,811 --> 00:21:05,022
That's May 15th for sure?

299
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:05,991
Yes

300
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:13,327
I returned to Gunma's parents' house on the 16th of the next day

301
00:21:13,352 --> 00:21:14,678
So I remember well

302
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:16,866
What time did you see her?

303
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:19,639
It was past 6 pm

304
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:22,022
Why did you remember the time ?

305
00:21:22,303 --> 00:21:26,717
Because my eldest son watches children's news on TV at 6 o'clock.

306
00:21:27,022 --> 00:21:30,577
What did her look like?

307
00:21:31,045 --> 00:21:34,108
After I watched the new with him

308
00:21:34,522 --> 00:21:36,522
I went out to clean up the store sign

309
00:21:43,186 --> 00:21:44,616
At that time, I was

310
00:21:45,022 --> 00:21:48,280
I thought she was an employee of the inn

311
00:21:49,006 --> 00:21:50,725
I didn't care at all

312
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,764
Why you lied?
You said you crossed the suspension bridge

313
00:21:56,999 --> 00:21:58,045
I crossed the suspension bridge

314
00:21:59,209 --> 00:22:02,827
But I parted with Abe after I crossed the suspension bridge

315
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:04,147
Give me a break

316
00:22:05,022 --> 00:22:08,147
You said you didn't cross the suspension bridge, that you left him at the foot of the bridge.

317
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:11,038
After the witnesses appeared you said you crossed the bridge and then you left him

318
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,171
Do you approach the crime scene every time a witness appears?

319
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:17,749
I really broke up with him after I crossed the bridge.

320
00:22:18,452 --> 00:22:22,038
But If I crossed the bridge, I'll be closer to the crime scene.

321
00:22:22,608 --> 00:22:23,772
I thought it would be a disadvantage

322
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:25,358
Give me a break

323
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,069
You should have said it from the beginning

324
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,639
A new witness has come out

325
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:35,264
What?

326
00:22:35,968 --> 00:22:37,077
No good, don't do that!

327
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:42,718
I'm Yano

328
00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:45,546
What is the new testimony?

329
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,593
Please tell me

330
00:22:49,866 --> 00:22:51,600
As the prosecutor says

331
00:22:52,522 --> 00:22:57,077
The man's screams, as heard by Kiyoko Kosaka, who was arraigned by the defense, were

332
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,046
It cannot be determined whether it belongs to the victim Abe

333
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,124
But It cannot be said that it is not Abe's

334
00:23:06,475 --> 00:23:08,788
Because it was the day of the incident

335
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:11,616
There is no evidence that it is not Abe

336
00:23:12,272 --> 00:23:18,796
From the situation, I think it's a scream that Abe fell off the cliff.

337
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:21,616
Therefore, this defense counsel

338
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:23,624
A new witness, Kiyoko Kosaka

339
00:23:23,968 --> 00:23:27,374
She went to visit her husband at a general hospital near the scene

340
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,632
On her return way

341
00:23:29,077 --> 00:23:32,804
Just before she gets on the bus in front of the hospital at 6:50

342
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:36,936
She heard the man scream

343
00:23:37,569 --> 00:23:42,085
This testimony should be emphasized

344
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:46,475
Therefore

345
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:49,741
At the crime time claimed by the prosecution

346
00:23:50,514 --> 00:23:54,514
The accused was at the suspension bridge at 6:03 with the victim

347
00:23:54,772 --> 00:23:58,889
The accused crossed the bridge and was at the crime scene at 6:15

348
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:03,569
It is said that she committed the crime in 13 minutes and returned to the inn.

349
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:05,436
In this case

350
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:09,350
The time when the accused pushed the victim to the bottom of the valley

351
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:13,921
It must be between 6:15 and 6:28

352
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,975
But the new witness hears his scream at 6:50

353
00:24:20,132 --> 00:24:21,671
What does this meaning?

354
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:26,093
If the prosecutor claims it is not the victim Abe scream

355
00:24:26,483 --> 00:24:29,014
Show confirmation that it is not Abe's voice

356
00:24:29,819 --> 00:24:31,038
According to the record

357
00:24:31,577 --> 00:24:35,350
The time when the accused returned to the inn is 6:55

358
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:39,296
The time when Abe fell into the valley is 6:50.

359
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,827
In doing so

360
00:24:41,952 --> 00:24:46,264
The accused has to return to the inn in 5 mins

361
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:48,131
To do so

362
00:24:49,054 --> 00:24:56,522
She had to run 2000 M at a speed of 15 seconds

363
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,147
Moreover she dressed Kimono at that day

364
00:25:00,389 --> 00:25:04,287
If she ran at a speed of 100 M 15 seconds

365
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:12,554
She ran like this way

366
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:15,913
It's not funny

367
00:25:16,796 --> 00:25:20,335
This is the behavior of the accused on the day of the crime claimed by the prosecutor.

368
00:25:21,593 --> 00:25:22,389
Secondly

369
00:25:23,077 --> 00:25:27,280
I will explain the life of Tatsuhiko Abe

370
00:25:28,382 --> 00:25:31,718
I'm not going to hurt the victim

371
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:36,764
But it ’s important in this case, so I will explain it.

372
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:41,202
That is different from the facts stated by the prosecutor

373
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:46,179
His personal life was a little troubled.

374
00:25:46,913 --> 00:25:47,639
Judge

375
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:50,335
Attorneys should continue to make statements

376
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,694
He was on May 14th, the day before his death

377
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:59,046
He stopped by his new lover

378
00:25:59,607 --> 00:26:02,193
This is his new lover

379
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:06,054
He stayed overnight at her house and came to Okutama the next day

380
00:26:06,663 --> 00:26:08,350
This means

381
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:14,905
The prosecutor said he only had a few thousand yen

382
00:26:15,358 --> 00:26:17,960
So the prosecutor determined that the accused had robbed the rest of the money.

383
00:26:18,421 --> 00:26:22,382
Also in that his underwear had a small amount of semen on it

384
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,132
The prosecutor has ruled that this means he had sex with the defendant.

385
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:27,374
I doubt this

386
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:30,593
He stayed at his lover's house the day before

387
00:26:31,054 --> 00:26:33,475
He gave the woman money

388
00:26:33,616 --> 00:26:36,264
I think he had sex with the woman

389
00:26:38,804 --> 00:26:42,210
If you argue, please show the rationale

390
00:26:43,733 --> 00:26:48,757
Prosecutors allege that the accused invited the victim

391
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:52,639
Prosecutors allege that the accused had sex with him and robbed him of money

392
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:55,944
There are discrepancies on these points.

393
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:58,905
That's all

394
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:01,670
By the points of the defense counsel

395
00:27:02,209 --> 00:27:08,256
There was no fact that the accused, Fumie Kaizuka, killed the subject and robbed him of the money.

396
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,217
The victim just fell

397
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:17,569
the accused, Fumie Kaizuka is not guilty

398
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:54,225
Stand up

399
00:28:01,686 --> 00:28:02,475
Sit down

400
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:10,311
Please come forward near,the accused, Fumie Kaizuka

401
00:28:20,748 --> 00:28:27,998
From now on, I will hand down the murder-robbery judgment against the accused.

402
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:39,897
the accused, Fumie Kaizuka is not guilty

403
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:51,342
The reason 1.
The accused is after the first trial

404
00:28:52,053 --> 00:28:54,248
She denies the crime in this case

405
00:28:54,795 --> 00:29:00,217
Especially at 5 pm on May 15, 1967

406
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:04,827
She has an alibi for that time

407
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:11,491
The court made a statement about the accused's alibi

408
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,522
The court adopts the defense counsel's allegations

409
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,186
As a result, the defendant was found not guilty.

410
00:29:19,428 --> 00:29:24,631
Firstly on May 15, 1967

411
00:29:24,889 --> 00:29:27,897
The court considered the accused's actions

412
00:29:38,741 --> 00:29:39,592
Cheers!

413
00:29:39,725 --> 00:29:40,702
Cheers!

414
00:29:48,772 --> 00:29:51,405
Thank you for this time

415
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,623
You did your best

416
00:29:55,444 --> 00:29:59,217
Everyone is mentally unstable during normal detention

417
00:29:59,608 --> 00:30:03,100
Everyone has the illusion of truth.

418
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,202
I was most worried about it

419
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:06,717
You did your best

420
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:07,647
I'm sure you had a hard time

421
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:08,475
Sensei

422
00:30:09,303 --> 00:30:11,725
You're forgetting one other woman who had a hard time.

423
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,756
Sorry

424
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,202
Ms. Kaizuka has a patience award, and you have a special merit award.

425
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:22,866
It was hard when I went to the site of Okutama with you

426
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:23,780
That's right

427
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,327
The witness you found was very effective

428
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:33,866
It seems I did nothing

429
00:30:33,952 --> 00:30:36,327
You worked good too

430
00:30:36,952 --> 00:30:39,936
And You will move to a new company

431
00:30:42,866 --> 00:30:46,694
I'll have her work in the office instead of you.

432
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:48,991
Me?

433
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:51,553
You can't work at that inn, right?

434
00:30:51,639 --> 00:30:54,514
But it seems to me difficult work

435
00:30:55,225 --> 00:30:56,147
I can't handle it

436
00:30:56,334 --> 00:31:00,709
Don't worry, you just serve tea,clean the office, and get bored

437
00:31:00,764 --> 00:31:03,022
Then you kill time near the coffee shop

438
00:31:04,225 --> 00:31:04,936
You bad

439
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,280
Oh,You laughed!

440
00:31:10,256 --> 00:31:12,108
I saw her laugh for the first time

441
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:14,678
So it was decided

442
00:31:15,694 --> 00:31:20,920
She will stay near the inn tonight, but We have to find her new apartment

443
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,959
Please enjoy drinking

444
00:31:31,123 --> 00:31:33,178
I called to book your inn just before

445
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:36,397
You forget all and take a rest

446
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:39,373
Thank you for everything

447
00:31:39,655 --> 00:31:44,224
I think you should move slowly later

448
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:45,795
Yes

449
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:52,827
I don't have much luggage

450
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,584
Oh here it is

451
00:32:03,506 --> 00:32:04,389
Good night

452
00:32:05,686 --> 00:32:06,584
Sensei

453
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:08,037
What?

454
00:32:10,717 --> 00:32:14,498
Oh don't worry, I have already paid the accommodation fee

455
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,420
It's not that

456
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:16,858
No? So what?

457
00:32:18,217 --> 00:32:22,670
How much does a lawyer fee cost?

458
00:32:23,092 --> 00:32:24,436
Did you worry about it?

459
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,459
As you may know, I don't have enough money

460
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:30,600
So

461
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:31,342
So?

462
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:33,162
So

463
00:32:34,475 --> 00:32:36,405
There is nothing I give you

464
00:32:37,561 --> 00:32:38,905
So...I...

465
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,342
You can sleep with me if you like

466
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,194
Ms.Kaizuka

467
00:32:47,116 --> 00:32:49,467
I'm not drunker

468
00:32:49,702 --> 00:32:50,686
I'm serious

469
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:54,162
if you like

470
00:32:54,834 --> 00:32:55,928
You are stupid

471
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:59,912
I'm not thinking of getting money from you

472
00:33:00,256 --> 00:33:01,764
You should take a rest, good night

473
00:33:03,522 --> 00:33:04,530
But sensei...

474
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,311
If we quarrel in front of the inn, we look weird

475
00:33:09,139 --> 00:33:10,428
Please come to our office tomorrow

476
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:13,748
We should talk about future

477
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:15,311
Yes

478
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:18,397
Have a good dream

479
00:33:43,366 --> 00:33:43,967
Another one?

480
00:33:44,998 --> 00:33:45,725
You came early

481
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:46,326
Yes

482
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:47,146
I didn't expect it

483
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,764
I thought you would stay somewhere

484
00:33:50,514 --> 00:33:52,217
You've been dumped by a woman.?

485
00:33:52,242 --> 00:33:53,233
I dumped her

486
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:54,678
You are cool play boy

487
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:06,467
Keep your change

488
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:08,155
Oh you are leaving now?

489
00:34:08,303 --> 00:34:11,178
I have plans with another woman.

490
00:34:11,248 --> 00:34:12,006
With Whom?

491
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:14,076
The person closest to me

492
00:34:15,764 --> 00:34:17,647
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

493
00:34:36,201 --> 00:34:38,436
What do you think about the prosecution's abandonment of appeal?

494
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:41,436
I was confident that I would win even if I fought in the Supreme Court

495
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:42,936
Is this the first time for you?

496
00:34:43,131 --> 00:34:45,850
This is the first time for a public defender

497
00:34:46,061 --> 00:34:47,444
Public defender is not profitable

498
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,334
You know very well

499
00:34:50,366 --> 00:34:52,248
This week's issue of our magazine headlines

500
00:34:52,475 --> 00:34:55,436
A gentle lawyer who takes over the former defendant

501
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:56,991
Do you think this is fine?

502
00:34:57,031 --> 00:34:57,810
Leave it to you

503
00:34:57,835 --> 00:34:59,412
I will make a good story and write an article

504
00:35:00,162 --> 00:35:02,287
These days, all the incidents are boring.

505
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,701
Then see you, have a nice day

506
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:15,701
You are like big star

507
00:35:16,006 --> 00:35:17,467
I should have take a charge of it

508
00:35:18,748 --> 00:35:19,358
Excuse me

509
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:20,803
Yes

510
00:35:23,256 --> 00:35:25,100
Please copy this

511
00:35:25,366 --> 00:35:25,842
Yes

512
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:28,740
When you copied it, Put it on the cutting machine.

513
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:29,358
Yes

514
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,006
Please write as carefully as possible

515
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:32,350
Yes

516
00:35:32,475 --> 00:35:33,506
Be careful about mis-writing

517
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:33,998
Yes

518
00:35:35,116 --> 00:35:38,022
I didn't notice but She is beautiful

519
00:35:38,771 --> 00:35:39,740
You think so?

520
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:41,553
Your attitude is not so good

521
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:43,498
But it's good she is here

522
00:35:44,506 --> 00:35:46,053
Do not make a fool of me

523
00:35:46,483 --> 00:35:49,459
I just hired her because she doesn't have a job

524
00:35:49,905 --> 00:35:51,756
I'm just kidding

525
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:54,295
Well...

526
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,873
So Can I reply to Mr.Yamakura about the case?

527
00:35:59,998 --> 00:36:00,936
Yes please

528
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:02,631
I'm not sure if I am good enough

529
00:36:02,717 --> 00:36:06,131
You just have to take on the corporate lawyer

530
00:36:06,826 --> 00:36:08,037
You can earn a lot

531
00:36:09,772 --> 00:36:10,537
Oh yeah

532
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:14,701
Wakamiya-Lawyer are interested in you after the case

533
00:36:15,436 --> 00:36:18,139
Your future may be bright

534
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,014
Please drink

535
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:33,014
This is something small but We would like to congratulate you

536
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:35,256
Thank you

537
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,623
I was talking about you when I talked to Kitagawa-kun of Nitto Bank today

538
00:36:42,522 --> 00:36:44,967
He really likes you

539
00:36:48,326 --> 00:36:54,678
I told him that you were my trainee before

540
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,358
Then he also likes me

541
00:36:58,264 --> 00:36:59,522
Thank you

542
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:03,834
Thank you for your work

543
00:37:05,967 --> 00:37:06,498
Please

544
00:37:06,694 --> 00:37:07,248
Tomoko

545
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:07,717
What?

546
00:37:08,194 --> 00:37:12,623
Yano also worked hard and became a first-class lawyer.

547
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,107
Congratulations

548
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:15,881
Not at all

549
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,084
You guys overestimate me

550
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:22,295
I was just lucky at the work

551
00:37:22,616 --> 00:37:24,436
I don't think it's my ability

552
00:37:25,553 --> 00:37:26,303
I see

553
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,420
She was expecting you all the time

554
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:30,405
What?

555
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,811
You grew up before I knew it

556
00:37:34,069 --> 00:37:35,116
You mean!

557
00:37:39,623 --> 00:37:44,584
You are a first-class lawyer now, your job will be more difficult.

558
00:37:44,811 --> 00:37:46,670
Please do your best from now on

559
00:37:47,217 --> 00:37:48,170
I know that

560
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:50,521
Daughter and I are expecting you

561
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:51,991
Thank you

562
00:37:52,545 --> 00:37:53,709
Can I eat?

563
00:37:54,116 --> 00:37:55,061
No no no

564
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,740
Can I eat?

565
00:37:58,061 --> 00:37:58,928
No no

566
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,319
Can I eat?

567
00:38:02,694 --> 00:38:04,944
Can I eat?

568
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:08,045
No, like this

569
00:38:08,201 --> 00:38:09,748
like this?

570
00:38:09,944 --> 00:38:11,811
Can I eat?

571
00:38:12,241 --> 00:38:12,842
Good evening

572
00:38:13,014 --> 00:38:13,600
Oh

573
00:38:13,694 --> 00:38:15,694
Do you eat ? because I got a gift

574
00:38:15,912 --> 00:38:17,201
Thank you

575
00:38:17,772 --> 00:38:18,951
Feel free to ask me if you need something

576
00:38:19,045 --> 00:38:21,420
Don't worry about that

577
00:38:21,445 --> 00:38:23,725
If you are in trouble, please feel free to tell me

578
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:24,209
See you

579
00:38:24,342 --> 00:38:25,451
Thank you

580
00:38:33,974 --> 00:38:34,568
Sensei

581
00:38:35,428 --> 00:38:36,522
Did you get used to it a little?

582
00:38:37,022 --> 00:38:37,764
Yes

583
00:38:38,162 --> 00:38:40,373
Everyone is very kind

584
00:38:40,398 --> 00:38:41,717
That's good to hear

585
00:38:45,194 --> 00:38:48,733
I'm sorry there is nothing here

586
00:38:48,758 --> 00:38:50,991
I will bring some beers from next door

587
00:38:51,405 --> 00:38:53,108
Don't worry about that

588
00:38:53,171 --> 00:38:54,396
But I feel sorry

589
00:38:54,553 --> 00:38:55,248
Please wait

590
00:39:27,233 --> 00:39:28,983
I got some snacks too

591
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,147
Please drink

592
00:39:44,678 --> 00:39:45,405
Thank you

593
00:39:49,311 --> 00:39:53,116
You used to work at an inn so you're used to it

594
00:39:53,514 --> 00:39:54,405
Sensei

595
00:39:55,209 --> 00:39:57,959
Please do not talk about the inn

596
00:39:57,997 --> 00:40:00,020
I didn't mean that

597
00:40:00,451 --> 00:40:01,006
I'll have this

598
00:40:06,694 --> 00:40:07,436
What?

599
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:10,623
I'm sorry

600
00:40:11,803 --> 00:40:13,451
I was very worried

601
00:40:14,201 --> 00:40:15,748
I thought you were angry

602
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,233
I was angry?

603
00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:17,975
For what?

604
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,100
Because

605
00:40:21,123 --> 00:40:27,201
I told you a dirty thing when you saw me off at the inn...

606
00:40:27,983 --> 00:40:29,084
A dirty thing?

607
00:40:30,116 --> 00:40:31,326
Did you tell me anything?

608
00:40:32,405 --> 00:40:36,186
I wanted to thank you

609
00:40:38,256 --> 00:40:39,334
I was stupid

610
00:40:40,443 --> 00:40:42,560
I couldn't tell anything but a dirty thing

611
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,123
Please forgive me

612
00:40:45,491 --> 00:40:47,358
You don't have to worry about it

613
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:52,412
At that time, we both had the feelings of a defense counsel and a defendant.

614
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:56,936
After the trial we are a man and woman

615
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:04,530
Don't you feel that way anymore?

616
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:06,420
I still feel

617
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,366
I'm stupid so

618
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:13,225
I can't say it well

619
00:41:15,248 --> 00:41:16,443
I'm stupid so

620
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:19,694
I'm stupid so

621
00:41:35,709 --> 00:41:36,764
Kaizuka-kun

622
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:38,069
Sensei

623
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,889
Kaizuka-kun

624
00:41:49,412 --> 00:41:50,155
I want you

625
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:51,912
Sensei

626
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:55,162
I want you too

627
00:42:22,975 --> 00:42:24,006
I...

628
00:42:24,694 --> 00:42:27,834
I expected this to happen

629
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:29,405
Kaizuka-kun

630
00:42:29,882 --> 00:42:34,162
I'm on the side of a weak person like you

631
00:42:59,282 --> 00:43:00,688
I feel happy

632
00:43:01,712 --> 00:43:05,462
I'm not thinking about the future

633
00:43:05,899 --> 00:43:07,969
It's Ok if I'm happy now

634
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,110
I'm happy now...

635
00:43:10,821 --> 00:43:11,829
Sensei

636
00:43:14,446 --> 00:43:19,149
But now we're the focus.

637
00:43:19,743 --> 00:43:21,743
So we have to be careful

638
00:43:22,008 --> 00:43:22,633
Ok?

639
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:24,282
I know

640
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:31,626
But I want to cook and wash your underwear as a woman

641
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:34,204
That's what I hope

642
00:43:35,165 --> 00:43:38,204
Don't think stupid

643
00:43:38,508 --> 00:43:39,352
You want to be an Idol?

644
00:43:39,626 --> 00:43:40,782
No

645
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:45,524
I won't be selfish so Don't leave me

646
00:43:46,399 --> 00:43:50,587
I want to support you from the shadows.

647
00:43:51,001 --> 00:43:52,860
so Don't leave me

648
00:43:58,032 --> 00:44:00,258
I'm okay with being a secret woman.

649
00:44:01,165 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm okay

650
00:44:04,415 --> 00:44:07,946
I think of that statutory time

651
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,868
I am very happy compared to that time

652
00:44:14,571 --> 00:44:15,704
You know what,Sensei

653
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:21,094
Will I never be called to court again?

654
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:23,821
Don't worry

655
00:44:24,618 --> 00:44:27,118
Professionally called non-bis in idem

656
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:33,766
Once acquittal is determined, they can never be tried again

657
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,001
Really?

658
00:44:37,993 --> 00:44:39,798
You don't trust me?

659
00:44:40,844 --> 00:44:43,516
It is written in Article 39 of the Constitution

660
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:47,087
I feel at ease

661
00:44:48,548 --> 00:44:51,118
Originally you were not the culprit

662
00:44:52,563 --> 00:44:54,532
You should be proud

663
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,633
Kaizuka-kun

664
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:03,782
Sensei

665
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:28,860
Oh thank you

666
00:45:31,579 --> 00:45:33,344
I'm going to the bank

667
00:45:33,399 --> 00:45:33,969
OK

668
00:45:34,102 --> 00:45:35,001
You need cigarettes?

669
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:36,711
Can you buy?

670
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:39,321
I'll get the money later.
Short-Hope, right?

671
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:01,594
You are strange

672
00:46:03,485 --> 00:46:04,469
You should tell me

673
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:06,453
Please say by name

674
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:08,024
Takeshi-san

675
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,188
You don't sleep with me these days

676
00:46:12,618 --> 00:46:14,141
Don't say weird things

677
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,477
So Where should I talk?

678
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:21,625
Recently you are crazy about her

679
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:22,711
Takahashi-kun

680
00:46:23,047 --> 00:46:23,922
I know

681
00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:29,375
You're concerned about the media, but you're a little bold.

682
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,407
I don't think you mean it

683
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:37,032
She's a cheap woman, you know. we don't even know where she's from.

684
00:46:38,164 --> 00:46:39,492
You should be careful

685
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:44,211
What about Wakamiya-sensei's daughter?

686
00:46:44,828 --> 00:46:47,719
I'm sure she will know about it

687
00:46:47,744 --> 00:46:49,453
You think too much

688
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:50,563
I'm sorry

689
00:46:51,399 --> 00:46:53,735
I found You have a hotel match

690
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:00,235
Of course he is not bad man

691
00:47:01,013 --> 00:47:05,115
But he has a wonderful future

692
00:47:05,795 --> 00:47:06,974
If I say it clearly

693
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:10,037
He just plays around you

694
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,920
This is not a joke

695
00:47:16,303 --> 00:47:19,185
I used to be just like you

696
00:47:19,818 --> 00:47:20,646
What?

697
00:47:23,295 --> 00:47:26,365
I don't want you to be like me

698
00:47:27,537 --> 00:47:30,357
If you're not careful, he'll just play you

699
00:47:31,373 --> 00:47:34,006
As you told be before,
What is his future path?

700
00:47:34,412 --> 00:47:36,669
You don't know?
Wakamiya sensei's

701
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:38,467
I know

702
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,365
It ’s his teacher.

703
00:47:40,834 --> 00:47:46,568
The teacher's daughter graduated from college this year.
He's a rich daughter

704
00:47:47,529 --> 00:47:49,388
She is different from us

705
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:55,240
Don't get me wrong.
I don't want you guys to break up

706
00:47:56,693 --> 00:48:00,536
I'm just giving you advice

707
00:48:08,912 --> 00:48:15,631
I hear when you were in college, all you did was work.
But Your grade was excellent

708
00:48:17,365 --> 00:48:19,209
I heard a lot about you from my Dad or others

709
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:22,263
Oh my god, but thank you

710
00:48:22,717 --> 00:48:27,662
But I wasn't the good student you think I am.

711
00:48:27,818 --> 00:48:28,599
No way

712
00:48:29,662 --> 00:48:32,334
You seem to have been working alone at any time

713
00:48:33,545 --> 00:48:34,381
That's good

714
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:46,693
I'm bossy.

715
00:48:49,857 --> 00:48:52,959
Can I follow you?

716
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:34,053
Kaizuka-kun

717
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,333
Why you are here?

718
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:40,099
Anyone saw you?

719
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,857
That's the way it is

720
00:49:49,928 --> 00:49:50,592
Come in

721
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,740
Good customers haven't come these days

722
00:49:57,435 --> 00:49:59,646
They only talk about marriage or divorce

723
00:50:02,115 --> 00:50:03,928
Why you keep standing, come in

724
00:50:05,146 --> 00:50:06,247
There is something you want to do, right?

725
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:08,326
I've heard from Okahashi

726
00:50:08,841 --> 00:50:09,357
What did you hear?

727
00:50:09,998 --> 00:50:10,951
Sensei

728
00:50:12,248 --> 00:50:14,287
You have something to do with her

729
00:50:16,294 --> 00:50:17,677
What are you taking about?

730
00:50:18,303 --> 00:50:20,693
I've heard about Wakamiya's daughter too

731
00:50:23,810 --> 00:50:25,467
Do you trust what I say?

732
00:50:26,904 --> 00:50:29,123
Or Do you trust what she says?

733
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:30,865
Which one?

734
00:50:32,263 --> 00:50:33,771
Why you didn't tell me?

735
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:36,131
It's needless to say

736
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,201
It's important to me

737
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:42,896
Is that true?

738
00:50:44,912 --> 00:50:46,568
What if it is true?

739
00:50:48,951 --> 00:50:50,990
Please do not look for various things

740
00:50:52,193 --> 00:50:53,521
It's weird

741
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,029
You said you wanted to be a shadow woman.

742
00:51:00,615 --> 00:51:03,678
That's not your business

743
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:07,474
You said you were on the side of the weak

744
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:08,849
Yes

745
00:51:09,592 --> 00:51:11,334
It doesn't mean an enemy

746
00:51:12,443 --> 00:51:14,709
You wanted to be a shadow woman.

747
00:51:14,912 --> 00:51:17,881
I just support you

748
00:51:20,826 --> 00:51:24,154
I'll decide whether I marry with Tomoko or not

749
00:51:24,678 --> 00:51:29,638
You also can decide whether you will be a shadow woman or leave me

750
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:32,873
The two have nothing to do with each other

751
00:51:33,654 --> 00:51:34,396
Does it make sense?

752
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:56,678
I'm sorry I'm late

753
00:52:20,935 --> 00:52:21,881
I will answer the phone

754
00:52:23,435 --> 00:52:24,654
Hello?
This is Yano speaking

755
00:52:26,224 --> 00:52:28,232
Yes,This is Yano speaking

756
00:52:29,084 --> 00:52:29,756
Yes

757
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:34,943
Yes I know.
I will go to the lobby of Togo Kaikan at 13:00

758
00:52:35,763 --> 00:52:36,334
Yes

759
00:52:37,998 --> 00:52:38,959
Ah...

760
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:40,662
Really?

761
00:52:43,537 --> 00:52:46,232
I apologize for interrupting your busy schedule.

762
00:52:46,451 --> 00:52:47,857
As I told you other day

763
00:52:48,076 --> 00:52:53,373
Mr. Kitagawa, the president of Nitto Bank, wants to meet you.

764
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,935
I am honored

765
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,881
He's always been a picky man.

766
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,709
He wants to be a matchmaker between you and Tomoko

767
00:53:00,904 --> 00:53:02,709
He decided it on his own

768
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:08,904
Let's decide the schedule while eating meal

769
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:11,842
Oh, he is coming

770
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:14,084
How are you?

771
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:16,271
I apologize for interrupting your busy schedule.

772
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:20,193
I introduce him.
He is the Yano Takeshi I talk you before

773
00:53:21,193 --> 00:53:24,099
He is a bad friend since my school days

774
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:26,693
He is Kitagawa,just old man

775
00:53:27,678 --> 00:53:31,919
I'm Yano.
Thank you for the good reputation

776
00:53:32,092 --> 00:53:33,928
You were good

777
00:53:34,638 --> 00:53:38,123
I also studied law at university

778
00:53:38,631 --> 00:53:40,498
Anyway let's have a meal

779
00:53:40,888 --> 00:53:42,904
Yes. let's go up stairs

780
00:53:45,865 --> 00:53:47,818
You dress nice,Tomoko

781
00:53:51,888 --> 00:53:53,224
What are you up to?

782
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:55,263
I'm doing Okay

783
00:54:11,263 --> 00:54:12,576
How did it go the other day?

784
00:54:13,592 --> 00:54:14,881
You forget?

785
00:54:32,506 --> 00:54:33,709
Please

786
00:54:38,310 --> 00:54:39,545
Take your seats

787
00:54:43,131 --> 00:54:44,185
Be relax

788
00:54:44,467 --> 00:54:46,521
You seem to have more work

789
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:47,553
Yes

790
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,756
Anyway Let's toast

791
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:14,162
Please take care of our daughter

792
00:55:14,818 --> 00:55:15,967
Let's toast

793
00:55:16,029 --> 00:55:16,888
Kanpai!

794
00:55:50,631 --> 00:55:51,560
I'm home

795
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:54,381
Good timing.
I have a call for you.

796
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:56,060
Phone call for me?

797
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:57,646
Yes from Kaizuka-san

798
00:55:57,974 --> 00:55:58,779
Kaizuka-san?

799
00:55:58,951 --> 00:55:59,607
Kaizuka?

800
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,763
A person who works in my office

801
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:05,904
Ah

802
00:56:06,084 --> 00:56:07,553
She calls for me, I will answer

803
00:56:07,842 --> 00:56:08,646
Thanks

804
00:56:08,671 --> 00:56:09,123
Here it is

805
00:56:15,724 --> 00:56:17,123
Hello? are you Kaizuka?

806
00:56:17,303 --> 00:56:18,615
It's me,Yano

807
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,826
Hello?

808
00:56:22,723 --> 00:56:23,317
Hello?

809
00:56:24,295 --> 00:56:24,967
Hello?

810
00:56:25,568 --> 00:56:26,146
Hello?

811
00:56:28,037 --> 00:56:28,607
Hello?

812
00:56:29,623 --> 00:56:30,248
Hello?

813
00:56:31,295 --> 00:56:31,842
Hello?

814
00:56:32,513 --> 00:56:33,162
Hello?

815
00:56:34,193 --> 00:56:36,029
Why you don't say anything?

816
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:37,498
Where are you now?

817
00:56:38,638 --> 00:56:39,240
Hello?

818
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:07,443
What's wrong with you?

819
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:09,373
Tell me

820
00:57:15,107 --> 00:57:16,349
Say something!

821
00:57:18,803 --> 00:57:22,178
I told you I want to be a shadow woman

822
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:24,076
I withdraw it

823
00:57:25,053 --> 00:57:25,709
What?

824
00:57:38,271 --> 00:57:41,763
I need a father for my coming baby

825
00:57:47,717 --> 00:57:48,998
Please marry me

826
00:57:49,959 --> 00:57:51,162
Are you insane?

827
00:57:52,615 --> 00:57:54,982
Is there evidence that the baby is mine?

828
00:57:55,951 --> 00:57:56,498
What?

829
00:57:56,795 --> 00:57:59,865
You are easy.
You slept with Abe

830
00:58:00,451 --> 00:58:01,310
Right?

831
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,693
That's too bad

832
00:58:04,154 --> 00:58:06,224
I tell you clearly

833
00:58:06,412 --> 00:58:09,084
I've just been playing you

834
00:58:13,474 --> 00:58:16,209
Why do you threaten me?

835
00:58:16,818 --> 00:58:18,045
Shame on you!

836
00:58:23,443 --> 00:58:25,545
You were kind before but..

837
00:58:27,318 --> 00:58:28,506
You have changed yourself

838
00:58:28,803 --> 00:58:30,279
I don't care about it!

839
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:34,568
You know what,You and I are out of balance.
You just stupid!

840
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:44,842
I tell you.
Do not dream that you want to be lawyer’s wife

841
00:58:45,045 --> 00:58:47,865
You are just shadow woman

842
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:50,837
You are so cheeky today

843
00:58:54,485 --> 00:58:55,173
You should think

844
00:58:56,196 --> 00:58:58,235
You were originally a murderer

845
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:02,477
You were supposed to be in jail

846
00:59:03,352 --> 00:59:06,587
But you can now live a normal life

847
00:59:07,954 --> 00:59:09,407
You should thank me

848
00:59:11,204 --> 00:59:12,079
Wait!

849
00:59:29,392 --> 00:59:32,079
You can't leave me

850
00:59:32,595 --> 00:59:33,517
Why?

851
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:36,235
I tell you

852
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:42,438
The true criminal who killed Abe

853
00:59:45,829 --> 00:59:46,727
I am

854
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,118
What?

855
00:59:51,282 --> 00:59:51,767
What?

856
01:00:02,485 --> 01:00:03,329
You stupid

857
01:00:04,493 --> 01:00:05,954
Don't be crazy

858
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:07,806
That's true

859
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:12,563
At that day... I was...

860
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:25,376
I crossed the suspension bridge with him for sure

861
01:00:26,657 --> 01:00:28,446
I found out later

862
01:00:29,624 --> 01:00:35,975
He told his friend he was going to rape me next time

863
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:39,475
Of course I didn't know that

864
01:00:50,202 --> 01:00:53,202
I was brought close to the cliff by him

865
01:00:53,913 --> 01:00:56,647
I was told to guide him because He wants azalea flowers

866
01:00:57,514 --> 01:00:58,405
Then...

867
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:05,100
I was raped

868
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:09,507
He forced to rape me

869
01:01:32,046 --> 01:01:34,639
Abe-san, you are bad

870
01:01:36,412 --> 01:01:37,248
What do you mean?

871
01:01:38,225 --> 01:01:41,092
I can't go home anymore today

872
01:01:41,952 --> 01:01:43,405
I see.
You want money,right?

873
01:01:43,858 --> 01:01:45,202
I don't mean that

874
01:01:45,483 --> 01:01:47,288
I was disappointed

875
01:01:49,053 --> 01:01:50,889
I pay for it and it means not rape.

876
01:01:51,514 --> 01:01:54,116
I bet with a friend.
I lost

877
01:01:54,171 --> 01:01:54,882
Shit

878
01:01:58,436 --> 01:02:00,194
I will give you money if you want

879
01:02:00,655 --> 01:02:03,585
If I pay, you are the same as prostitution

880
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:04,491
Take it

881
01:02:07,632 --> 01:02:08,475
Oh my god

882
01:02:08,827 --> 01:02:12,624
Poor people really want money

883
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:24,624
50000yen is not enough?

884
01:02:25,233 --> 01:02:27,092
You are greedy

885
01:02:31,913 --> 01:02:33,717
Leave me!

886
01:03:27,217 --> 01:03:30,225
I was panicking

887
01:03:33,952 --> 01:03:34,803
I ran away

888
01:03:35,936 --> 01:03:36,600
You are lying

889
01:03:37,327 --> 01:03:38,217
You are lying

890
01:03:40,499 --> 01:03:42,694
Do you think you can fool me?

891
01:03:43,842 --> 01:03:46,936
Did you fly back to your inn?

892
01:03:46,967 --> 01:03:50,014
Just then A car passed by

893
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:52,694
A car?

894
01:03:54,467 --> 01:03:55,475
Give me a break

895
01:03:56,030 --> 01:03:59,874
The road was under construction at that time

896
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:03,827
It ’s a car that a foreigner was driving.
So he couldn't read the Japanese sign

897
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:12,702
It's nonsense

898
01:04:16,655 --> 01:04:19,858
Where was his notebook?

899
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:52,491
I didn't want to tell the truth

900
01:04:53,905 --> 01:04:56,085
I didn't want to say it even if it killed me.

901
01:04:58,038 --> 01:05:01,897
This is my last word in my life

902
01:05:03,569 --> 01:05:08,694
But you tried to leave me so....

903
01:05:09,147 --> 01:05:11,249
I had no way to keep you

904
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,030
I know I am not qualified as layer's wife

905
01:05:16,178 --> 01:05:19,171
The feeling I want to be with you

906
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:23,592
It does not matter if I am poor or rich or no educated

907
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:27,249
I don't want to let anyone marry you

908
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:33,264
If you dump me, I will visit Wakamiya

909
01:05:33,335 --> 01:05:36,936
I will ask Tomoko and tell the truth

910
01:05:38,913 --> 01:05:42,616
But if you really don't like me

911
01:05:43,710 --> 01:05:45,920
I go to court and sue you

912
01:05:47,553 --> 01:05:49,663
I say you're an accomplice.

913
01:06:04,311 --> 01:06:05,335
Is that all you want to say?

914
01:06:06,038 --> 01:06:09,085
Help me, Sensei

915
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:15,037
You stupid

916
01:06:16,522 --> 01:06:18,397
Who can trust you, crazy woman

917
01:06:18,585 --> 01:06:22,210
That case is already complete

918
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,592
You will only be laughed at.

919
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,593
Do it whatever you want!

920
01:06:52,593 --> 01:06:56,077
I don't know what happened

921
01:06:57,694 --> 01:07:00,850
Shit!
That crazy woman threatened me

922
01:07:10,921 --> 01:07:12,663
I don't want to let anyone marry you

923
01:07:13,116 --> 01:07:16,147
If you dump me, I will visit Wakamiya

924
01:07:16,538 --> 01:07:19,936
I will ask Tomoko and tell the truth.
I go to court and sue you

925
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:22,522
I say you're an accomplice.

926
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:24,608
You're an accomplice.

927
01:07:25,421 --> 01:07:26,944
You're an accomplice.

928
01:07:27,671 --> 01:07:29,327
You're an accomplice.

929
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,678
You're an accomplice.

930
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:48,778
Stop!

931
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:52,747
Get after the car

932
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,129
Are you police?

933
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,911
Whatever, Keep eyes on that car!

934
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:01,770
OK

935
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:05,395
Please turn right at the next corner

936
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,840
They are heading to Denenchofu

937
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,067
Denenchofu?

938
01:10:25,825 --> 01:10:26,864
Damn it

939
01:10:27,903 --> 01:10:29,872
What shall I do?

940
01:10:31,387 --> 01:10:32,192
Excuse me

941
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:34,692
Wait for me

942
01:10:47,950 --> 01:10:49,223
Wait here

943
01:10:49,856 --> 01:10:50,333
OK

944
01:10:56,840 --> 01:11:00,129
Our staff Kaizuka came here?

945
01:11:00,270 --> 01:11:01,895
You didn't meet her?

946
01:11:02,004 --> 01:11:03,176
She visited us just before

947
01:11:03,356 --> 01:11:04,645
What she said?

948
01:11:04,856 --> 01:11:08,044
She said you come here for urgent business soon

949
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:09,816
Unfortunately There is no one today

950
01:11:09,872 --> 01:11:10,692
I have to go

951
01:11:35,184 --> 01:11:36,176
Kaizuka-kun

952
01:11:37,004 --> 01:11:37,934
You are really...

953
01:11:39,387 --> 01:11:42,364
All I wan to say is as I told you last night

954
01:11:43,622 --> 01:11:44,106
I get it

955
01:11:50,114 --> 01:11:51,629
You surely sue me

956
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:52,872
Yes

957
01:11:55,442 --> 01:11:56,786
Ok I see

958
01:11:57,301 --> 01:11:58,153
Good morning

959
01:11:59,536 --> 01:12:01,754
We've received the documents from Yamamura Sangyo for you

960
01:12:02,192 --> 01:12:03,044
Thank you

961
01:12:03,069 --> 01:12:05,825
I envy you becoming a popular lawyer.

962
01:12:07,528 --> 01:12:08,184
Kaizuka-kun

963
01:12:08,209 --> 01:12:09,075
Stay away

964
01:12:10,098 --> 01:12:10,989
I'll come here again

965
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:12,973
I'll go home today

966
01:12:13,926 --> 01:12:16,020
I'm sorry but let me take a holiday

967
01:12:16,715 --> 01:12:17,333
Excuse me

968
01:12:36,965 --> 01:12:39,270
You told her bad things

969
01:12:40,996 --> 01:12:43,012
I didn't mean that

970
01:12:44,028 --> 01:12:49,020
You are about to get married.
I thought it was better to organize your relationships

971
01:12:50,387 --> 01:12:52,293
I don't want you to grudge

972
01:12:54,059 --> 01:12:57,934
But you're going to be a pain in the ass.

973
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:04,160
There may be no legal problem but

974
01:13:04,543 --> 01:13:06,746
But it will affect your work

975
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:11,770
The media may say you are a bad lawyer

976
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:15,528
I'm in trouble

977
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,278
And also

978
01:13:20,324 --> 01:13:23,613
Kaizuka is completely different from Ms. Tomoko

979
01:13:24,442 --> 01:13:26,965
Tomoko may have a fever and sleep all day

980
01:13:27,434 --> 01:13:29,543
What should I do, Yukiko

981
01:13:35,676 --> 01:13:38,106
You are an egoist but You're small-minded.

982
01:13:40,981 --> 01:13:43,121
I need your wisdom.

983
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:49,699
Sensei

984
01:13:50,535 --> 01:13:53,442
I hate this kind of life

985
01:13:54,707 --> 01:13:56,004
I told you, right?

986
01:13:56,371 --> 01:13:59,192
I want to open a clothing store in Roppongi

987
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:04,668
I found the shop in Yotsuya

988
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,731
It costs 5 million yen for an unoccupied property.

989
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,207
You will marry a rich daughter

990
01:14:10,801 --> 01:14:13,293
Furthermore, the president of the bank is a matchmaker.

991
01:14:14,067 --> 01:14:16,129
How about instead of money for my retirement?

992
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:17,910
What the hell you talk about?

993
01:14:19,926 --> 01:14:22,793
What are you saying?
Now I'm in so much trouble

994
01:14:23,317 --> 01:14:25,309
I'm not telling you to do it for free

995
01:14:27,184 --> 01:14:29,645
I'm the only person who knows your secret

996
01:14:30,121 --> 01:14:30,785
In short

997
01:14:32,153 --> 01:14:33,395
It is an exchange condition

998
01:14:36,395 --> 01:14:37,184
It is an exchange condition?

999
01:14:37,645 --> 01:14:38,809
You don't get it?

1000
01:14:40,246 --> 01:14:41,223
You kill her

1001
01:14:42,387 --> 01:14:43,090
kill her?

1002
01:14:44,731 --> 01:14:45,465
I kill who?

1003
01:14:45,684 --> 01:14:48,246
Of course Fumie Kaizuka

1004
01:14:50,449 --> 01:14:52,926
You kill her pretending to be an accidental death

1005
01:14:53,559 --> 01:14:57,910
And I testify that it was an accidental death

1006
01:15:07,488 --> 01:15:09,082
Dear Judge

1007
01:15:09,848 --> 01:15:15,449
I swear to God now and tell the truth

1008
01:15:21,074 --> 01:15:21,895
Travel...

1009
01:15:22,442 --> 01:15:28,481
If someone suspects us, I will say the three of us were planning to go together.

1010
01:15:29,879 --> 01:15:35,317
I testify that I got sick on the day and couldn't go

1011
01:15:36,778 --> 01:15:38,504
This is the important point

1012
01:15:48,348 --> 01:15:50,895
Whether to die by negligence or accident

1013
01:15:52,668 --> 01:15:58,559
In any case, there's only one way I told you.

1014
01:16:07,371 --> 01:16:08,973
From whom?

1015
01:16:11,293 --> 01:16:12,348
Hello?

1016
01:16:12,988 --> 01:16:14,824
What?
Kaizuka-san?

1017
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:16,262
Wait a min

1018
01:16:16,973 --> 01:16:19,348
Kaizuka-san?
Phone call for you

1019
01:16:20,621 --> 01:16:21,270
Thanks

1020
01:16:29,317 --> 01:16:30,356
Thanks

1021
01:16:31,645 --> 01:16:33,488
Hello?
This is Kaizuka speaking

1022
01:16:36,387 --> 01:16:36,926
Yes

1023
01:16:55,840 --> 01:16:56,480
Come in

1024
01:17:03,433 --> 01:17:04,394
Thank you for coming at mid-night

1025
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:17,965
You might laugh if I say this

1026
01:17:18,457 --> 01:17:23,621
I called you because I want you to live in this house

1027
01:17:25,449 --> 01:17:26,317
Trust me

1028
01:17:26,535 --> 01:17:31,262
What I mean is.. I want to apologize you

1029
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:32,356
Come in

1030
01:17:35,528 --> 01:17:39,926
I'm not doing this because I don't want to be sued by you

1031
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:47,613
I remember supporting you in the court

1032
01:17:48,848 --> 01:17:50,528
I remembered that moment.

1033
01:17:54,129 --> 01:18:02,035
I was thinking of using Mr. Wakamiya's daughter to get ahead.

1034
01:18:04,215 --> 01:18:07,106
But I realized my true self now

1035
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:08,996
Fujie

1036
01:18:09,707 --> 01:18:11,348
I'm breaking off my marriage to Tomoko.

1037
01:18:12,613 --> 01:18:19,660
I don't care if you're a murderer.
I want to start with you again from the beginning

1038
01:18:22,817 --> 01:18:26,801
Fujie, Let's get marry for our coming baby

1039
01:18:50,377 --> 01:18:51,455
Sensei

1040
01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:53,486
I was sorry

1041
01:18:54,509 --> 01:18:57,642
I was about to send a letter to the court

1042
01:19:02,150 --> 01:19:03,142
Fujie

1043
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:06,572
I'm the only person who understand you

1044
01:19:07,814 --> 01:19:09,916
I'm asking you to marry me.

1045
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:12,478
I was sorry

1046
01:19:14,306 --> 01:19:16,924
I will be your slave for the rest of my life

1047
01:19:17,353 --> 01:19:18,431
Please forgive me

1048
01:19:22,689 --> 01:19:25,517
Let us forget about last night.

1049
01:19:28,338 --> 01:19:30,806
Would you like to go on a trip for a few days?

1050
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:32,822
Go on a trip ?

1051
01:19:34,338 --> 01:19:35,861
Let's go to a place where the air is clean

1052
01:19:36,634 --> 01:19:37,900
Then let's forget what we have done

1053
01:19:39,049 --> 01:19:41,252
Let us make a new start

1054
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:42,970
Sensei

1055
01:19:43,181 --> 01:19:44,892
Let's drive early tomorrow morning

1056
01:19:46,697 --> 01:19:47,463
I'm happy

1057
01:20:00,392 --> 01:20:01,244
Sensei

1058
01:20:01,994 --> 01:20:03,080
Don't leave me

1059
01:20:04,330 --> 01:20:05,603
I won't

1060
01:20:06,252 --> 01:20:07,681
I won't leave you  for the rest of my life

1061
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:37,876
Your tea

1062
01:20:37,985 --> 01:20:38,907
Thank you

1063
01:20:39,954 --> 01:20:41,501
It's very quiet here

1064
01:20:41,813 --> 01:20:44,907
This season is a quiet season

1065
01:20:45,243 --> 01:20:46,923
Your wife is the first time to come here?

1066
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:52,017
We will go for fish tomorrow so  Please lend us a boat

1067
01:20:52,462 --> 01:20:52,938
Yes

1068
01:20:53,313 --> 01:20:55,782
There may be fog tomorrow

1069
01:20:56,079 --> 01:20:56,501
fog?

1070
01:20:56,665 --> 01:20:57,306
Yes

1071
01:20:59,165 --> 01:21:00,173
That's too bad

1072
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:04,008
But we want to go because we came here

1073
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,493
Sure

1074
01:21:04,751 --> 01:21:05,485
I will go too?

1075
01:21:06,743 --> 01:21:07,868
I'm scared to get on the boat

1076
01:21:08,267 --> 01:21:10,970
Don't worry.
Our boat is solid.

1077
01:21:11,095 --> 01:21:13,118
But I can't swim

1078
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,392
You stupid.
The boat will not capsize

1079
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:17,243
And I will be with you

1080
01:21:17,384 --> 01:21:18,329
That's right

1081
01:21:18,821 --> 01:21:19,821
Please enjoy

1082
01:21:20,196 --> 01:21:21,306
Then please make yourself at home

1083
01:21:21,446 --> 01:21:22,126
Thanks

1084
01:21:27,657 --> 01:21:28,438
Is something wrong?

1085
01:21:29,087 --> 01:21:30,345
Well...nothing

1086
01:21:30,454 --> 01:21:31,642
You are strange, tell me

1087
01:21:32,798 --> 01:21:36,962
Because she said I'm your wife

1088
01:21:39,274 --> 01:21:40,509
Everyone thinks so

1089
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:44,821
I've never been called that way

1090
01:23:45,133 --> 01:23:45,969
You are late

1091
01:23:45,994 --> 01:23:50,008
I'm sorry,I forgot the sandwich we ordered

1092
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:53,438
Please

1093
01:24:07,563 --> 01:24:07,844
Let's go

1094
01:24:07,969 --> 01:24:08,415
Yes

1095
01:24:42,883 --> 01:24:45,298
I think you got fish

1096
01:24:45,438 --> 01:24:45,798
Hmm

1097
01:25:03,298 --> 01:25:04,337
It's strange

1098
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:07,235
It looks like the fish are in a bad mood today

1099
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:13,930
Let's go to the shore.
Here is bad place to fish

1100
01:25:18,157 --> 01:25:20,001
We don't need to move

1101
01:25:27,157 --> 01:25:28,423
I feel cold

1102
01:25:34,415 --> 01:25:35,298
Let's go back

1103
01:25:52,790 --> 01:25:53,469
Sensei

1104
01:25:54,798 --> 01:25:57,688
Can I guess what you are thinking now?

1105
01:25:59,626 --> 01:26:01,438
You are trying to kill me

1106
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:10,204
I found out it when I looked into your eyes last night.

1107
01:26:11,868 --> 01:26:15,337
But I wanted to beside you whatever you do to me

1108
01:26:17,102 --> 01:26:18,743
So I came with you

1109
01:26:21,735 --> 01:26:22,313
I see

1110
01:26:23,774 --> 01:26:24,813
What will you do if it's true?

1111
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:31,626
Right,I'm thinking of killing you

1112
01:26:32,173 --> 01:26:34,071
And I will be with Tomoko

1113
01:26:34,985 --> 01:26:37,266
You will sink with this boat

1114
01:26:40,829 --> 01:26:42,962
No one can see in the fog

1115
01:26:43,344 --> 01:26:45,298
You fell into the water trying to catch a fish

1116
01:26:45,454 --> 01:26:48,868
I tried to save you but there was something wrong on the boat

1117
01:26:56,149 --> 01:26:59,329
I tried to save you but couldn't see in the fog

1118
01:27:00,204 --> 01:27:01,430
This is unavoidable

1119
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:03,501
You understand?

1120
01:27:05,032 --> 01:27:09,321
The act that was unavoidably committed for the life of oneself or others

1121
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:13,102
If the other person is sacrificed, it is not a crime under the criminal law.

1122
01:27:27,914 --> 01:27:28,977
Sensei

1123
01:27:39,016 --> 01:27:40,969
Don't go anywhere,Sensei

1124
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:43,555
I will not give you to anyone

1125
01:27:43,602 --> 01:27:44,571
Sensei

1126
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:02,930
You are mine

1127
01:28:02,955 --> 01:28:04,766
You are mine!

1128
01:28:34,305 --> 01:28:35,462
Dear Judge

1129
01:28:37,243 --> 01:28:40,485
I'm going to get on the boat so I write a letter fast

1130
01:28:42,626 --> 01:28:46,626
I can't leave Mr. Yano

1131
01:28:48,024 --> 01:28:49,798
We choose death

1132
01:28:52,290 --> 01:28:52,930
And

1133
01:28:53,938 --> 01:28:57,587
I am also the true criminal who killed Abe

1134
01:28:58,665 --> 01:29:01,798
I threw the proof Boston bag into the river

1135
01:29:02,852 --> 01:29:05,391
Abe's notebook is in Mr. Yano's apartment

1136
01:29:06,719 --> 01:29:08,110
Wakamiya-sensei

1137
01:29:08,501 --> 01:29:10,157
Tomoko-san,Yukiko-san

1138
01:29:11,235 --> 01:29:12,665
Please forgive me

1139
01:29:14,173 --> 01:29:15,001
Good bye

1140
01:29:20,938 --> 01:29:22,102
I didn't know

1141
01:29:23,673 --> 01:29:25,548
I didn't know they'd gone to the lake.

1142
01:29:28,242 --> 01:29:29,367
He is stupid

1143
01:29:30,391 --> 01:29:32,399
That woman ruined his life.

1144
01:29:38,868 --> 01:29:40,485
I should have known it

1145
01:29:43,063 --> 01:29:44,415
I could stop them

1146
01:29:51,024 --> 01:29:51,477
Good morning

1147
01:29:51,626 --> 01:29:52,899
Good morning

1148
01:29:57,297 --> 01:29:58,125
Hi,Machida

1149
01:29:58,407 --> 01:29:58,758
hi

1150
01:29:58,883 --> 01:30:00,680
It's bee a whole

1151
01:30:00,899 --> 01:30:02,305
I have nothing to do

1152
01:30:02,648 --> 01:30:05,101
I'll be a court-appointed attorney and make some extra money.

1153
01:30:06,516 --> 01:30:08,251
Is there any interesting incident?

1154
01:30:26,086 --> 01:30:31,313
Finish

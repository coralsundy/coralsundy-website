2
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:20,310
The difference in height is 11cm so

3
00:00:20,373 --> 00:00:21,998
If he is careless, as you can see

4
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,505
It's like it's coming from above

5
00:00:24,584 --> 00:00:25,638
He lost his balance

6
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:26,857
In that case, you know

7
00:00:26,904 --> 00:00:28,560
It's his best chance to attack

8
00:00:31,655 --> 00:00:33,671
His right hand struck cleanly

9
00:00:33,726 --> 00:00:34,429
bang-bang!

10
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,187
Are you in?

11
00:00:37,523 --> 00:00:38,226
I'm here

12
00:00:40,781 --> 00:00:42,258
We're missing a member

13
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:43,477
What do you think?

14
00:00:47,524 --> 00:00:49,485
He is coming here later

15
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:51,266
Until then, okay?

16
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:55,370
I haven't done that in a while

17
00:01:20,631 --> 00:01:21,209
Take it for me

18
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:25,194
Hey master,Another sucker has arrived from Osaka

19
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:27,084
Tong! Here is it!

20
00:01:27,638 --> 00:01:29,076
I don't know if you're a sucker or a wolf

21
00:01:29,153 --> 00:01:31,270
You're terrible. You're playing with him

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,732
Hahahaha

23
00:02:45,178 --> 00:02:47,460
Hey you, If you lost,you pay on your won

24
00:02:47,663 --> 00:02:50,023
Oh dear,Don't be so heartless

25
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,186
You can't just do that

26
00:02:52,335 --> 00:02:53,936
That's how you fooled me the other day

27
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:56,179
In the world of competition, husband and wife are irrelevant

28
00:02:56,366 --> 00:02:57,515
But you all have one wallet

29
00:02:59,265 --> 00:02:59,671
Hi

30
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:02,351
Let me join in

31
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:04,226
You saw our card right?

32
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:07,272
Hey Misaki!

33
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,657
Hello guest

34
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:10,876
I will play mah-jongg game

35
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:11,742
Misaki

36
00:03:13,578 --> 00:03:14,188
Misaki

37
00:03:20,377 --> 00:03:22,174
Takei-san's father got bald head

38
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,525
But He's been nagging me all day

39
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,080
For what?

40
00:03:25,127 --> 00:03:27,244
You should learn a little from him

41
00:03:27,424 --> 00:03:28,135
I wonder it works or not

42
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:30,658
Welcome us

43
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:32,243
We are playing mahjong

44
00:03:34,727 --> 00:03:35,187
Get it!

45
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,361
I've got good cards

46
00:03:37,978 --> 00:03:40,142
You're very strong

47
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:41,556
You

48
00:03:42,228 --> 00:03:42,572
Wanna play?

49
00:03:42,814 --> 00:03:44,040
You play,Mai

50
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:45,673
Can you change seat, Asai-san

51
00:03:45,923 --> 00:03:46,525
I'll make coffee

52
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:48,149
I'll make coffee for you, so you carry on playing

53
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,322
I'm sorry but It's all in the kitchen

54
00:03:52,243 --> 00:03:54,540
How is your business, Asai-san?

55
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,915
Not so bad

56
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:11,401
This is Maruyama trading company

57
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,354
Is Kitagawa section chief in?

58
00:04:14,143 --> 00:04:14,628
I'm Asai

59
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:17,643
Oh, Are you Kitagawa-san?
I'm Asai

60
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:19,221
What's the executive director's thinking?

61
00:04:20,018 --> 00:04:20,478
Ah?

62
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:21,830
Yes

63
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:26,994
You think it's too early?
Can you do it now? You have the authority

64
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,487
You're using a lot of those now, aren't you?

65
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,940
So, Thank you in advance

66
00:04:32,464 --> 00:04:32,792
See you then

67
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:34,690
Hey you

68
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:35,456
What?

69
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:38,589
You have a wife, and you cheated on me

70
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,407
Who said that to you?

71
00:04:42,454 --> 00:04:43,329
I know all now

72
00:04:46,056 --> 00:04:47,415
Did you talk to the people down there?

73
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,470
A woman has come to see you from Kyoto

74
00:04:59,498 --> 00:05:01,186
You cheated me well

75
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:03,045
I didn't mean to that

76
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:06,257
Everyone was laughing downstairs. They said I was stupid.

77
00:05:07,343 --> 00:05:09,928
You can't live in this day and age if you worry about what people say about you

78
00:05:16,933 --> 00:05:17,777
Come here

79
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,600
What is your wife like?

80
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,577
Don't worry, We will divorce

81
00:05:29,499 --> 00:05:30,694
Since when you are being with her?

82
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:33,866
She's the daughter of the family that took care of me when I was in school

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,972
She'd been to music school

84
00:05:39,936 --> 00:05:42,491
You can't simply leave a woman like that.

85
00:05:43,062 --> 00:05:44,430
The daughter of a benefactor...

86
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:46,304
I've repaid him well

87
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:48,937
I helped him out of a failed business venture

88
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:51,402
Where is she living?

89
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:53,910
She lives in Kasaoka where is outside of Okayama

90
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,137
You are also from there

91
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:05,715
I will leave her

92
00:06:07,093 --> 00:06:09,968
I feel bad that you're splitting up for me

93
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:12,523
Because you said you are cheated

94
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,592
I don't want to be that wife

95
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,053
Hello?

96
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,444
Are you Kojima?

97
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,303
I guess we work well with Maruyama trading company

98
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:39,576
Chief's urging me to do it

99
00:06:40,694 --> 00:06:41,796
I will go there later

100
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:42,913
You go back?

101
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:46,429
I must go for our business

102
00:06:46,623 --> 00:06:47,264
Give me my shirt

103
00:06:52,118 --> 00:06:55,258
You come here to sleep with me

104
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:05,829
Car salesmen are

105
00:07:06,691 --> 00:07:08,597
to find an opening for them

106
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,519
When the new car sells, I'll buy you the one you like

107
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:14,192
You worry about your wife as I thought

108
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,660
How long are you saying

109
00:07:18,359 --> 00:07:19,820
Your wife is very jealous

110
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:30,124
I will be back day after tomorrow

111
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,136
Hi Yuki

112
00:08:22,323 --> 00:08:23,605
It's late

113
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,323
You're very easygoing, aren't you?

114
00:08:26,355 --> 00:08:27,238
When did you come?

115
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:28,566
Just now

116
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:31,769
Hey you

117
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,688
Get up,Maki is here

118
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:37,930
You don't have to wake him up

119
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,478
He is sleeping all day

120
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,226
Oh, welcome

121
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:49,656
I'm sorry to disturb you

122
00:08:51,445 --> 00:08:52,663
Please come in

123
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:53,358
Yes

124
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:57,726
How are you going with?

125
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,273
I'm thinking of separete with Asai

126
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:04,812
Why is that?

127
00:09:05,778 --> 00:09:07,395
I don't want to live like that

128
00:09:09,184 --> 00:09:10,161
I will go out

129
00:09:10,949 --> 00:09:11,497
Make yourself at home

130
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,231
I'm sorry to bother you

131
00:09:21,482 --> 00:09:22,529
Never mind

132
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,473
He goes in and out of sleep

133
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:30,238
There are no good jobs around here at all

134
00:09:31,496 --> 00:09:32,840
There is no work?

135
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,941
He sells this, you know what is this?

136
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,144
This seems good

137
00:09:40,504 --> 00:09:42,831
It's a fake painting of a famous person

138
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,519
This looks real

139
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:48,844
He's a fall guy, selling fakes

140
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:50,469
He is idiot

141
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:53,007
But you are with him long

142
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,085
What do you like about him?

143
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,336
There is no good or bad. No choice

144
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,516
That's about it

145
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:01,938
I envy you

146
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:06,236
You live in a big house and don't have to worry about money

147
00:10:07,314 --> 00:10:08,462
Kind of

148
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:12,890
It's all thanks to him.
You should be thanking him

149
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:17,650
It's boring to be bored every day waiting for a man

150
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,978
My body becomes loose

151
00:10:23,452 --> 00:10:25,062
I feel enjoyble when I was working

152
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,125
Hey master

153
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:34,805
Good evening

154
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:37,086
It's been a whole

155
00:10:37,523 --> 00:10:38,750
You are with Yuki

156
00:10:39,866 --> 00:10:41,092
How's your business going?

157
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:42,444
Not so bad

158
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:44,975
I'm having trouble with our most popular one quitting the store

159
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:46,866
No customers at all

160
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:51,585
Hi Master, Look this

161
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:53,960
ha

162
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,493
There is a stain like this.
Is this going to cost me 3,000 yen?

163
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,148
Take it off if you don't like

164
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:01,312
Oh...but

165
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:02,453
Take it off if you don't like

166
00:11:02,539 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh...

167
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:11,750
She doesn't do her job, and all she does is complain

168
00:11:17,859 --> 00:11:18,781
Excuse me

169
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,556
I hate this place. I think I'd rather live in Nio-san

170
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:32,553
I'm back

171
00:11:32,607 --> 00:11:34,451
You are late.Asai-san is here

172
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:35,482
I see

173
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,975
This is suvenior for you

174
00:11:40,042 --> 00:11:40,737
Thank you

175
00:11:48,871 --> 00:11:49,519
I'm back

176
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:52,753
Where have you been?

177
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,652
I thought you have left from me

178
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:58,870
Hey

179
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,684
You're going to spill beer

180
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:04,156
I won't let you go home tonight

181
00:12:06,452 --> 00:12:06,928
Mmmm..

182
00:12:06,999 --> 00:12:08,109
Hey stop it

183
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:18,259
What wrong with you?

184
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:21,337
Hey

185
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:38,414
I see. I'm surprised

186
00:12:39,103 --> 00:12:42,252
How could you sleep with him for 16 hours?

187
00:12:43,402 --> 00:12:47,519
Whenever I see my husband , it makes me want a drink.

188
00:12:48,028 --> 00:12:50,700
I guess I feel like into Asai step by step

189
00:12:51,676 --> 00:12:52,591
I guess that's fine

190
00:12:53,142 --> 00:12:55,431
But It's the crime of having driven his wife away.

191
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:57,939
Hi, come in

192
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,978
Hello, I'm Asai's wife

193
00:13:15,383 --> 00:13:18,875
Hello, How are you? Sorry I am dressed down

194
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:19,648
You leave

195
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,344
Yes

196
00:13:24,969 --> 00:13:27,352
It's been a whole, Please come in

197
00:13:28,524 --> 00:13:31,461
My husband comes here often?

198
00:13:32,218 --> 00:13:36,624
He did come in half a month ago, but not at all recently

199
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:40,722
Oh..She's a neighbor. Don't worry about it

200
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,089
Excuse me

201
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:48,204
Well, you want to leave some massages for Asai-san?

202
00:13:49,631 --> 00:13:52,935
No, that's ok. Sorry to disturb you

203
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:54,498
Oh I see

204
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,583
I saw your wife's face clearly

205
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,707
She must not know you're here

206
00:14:31,473 --> 00:14:33,004
Women are animalistic

207
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,402
Her sixth sense

208
00:14:36,261 --> 00:14:36,995
It maybe so

209
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:42,199
You are away from your home for 4 days. You should go home sometime

210
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:46,519
You're so selfish.
Because you won't let go

211
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:52,318
I would consider you and your wife together

212
00:14:57,254 --> 00:14:58,598
We should move out here

213
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:02,004
The people downstairs are noisy and the environment is bad

214
00:15:02,363 --> 00:15:02,863
Right

215
00:15:03,564 --> 00:15:04,931
The only woman who isn't your true love

216
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,875
Drive carefully. It's for sale

217
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:16,289
I know

218
00:15:17,468 --> 00:15:18,022
Good night

219
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:19,053
Good night

220
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:43,584
Welcome back home

221
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:46,685
I'm so tired

222
00:15:46,787 --> 00:15:47,904
The bath is ready

223
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:52,334
I won't take, I feel I got cold

224
00:15:56,864 --> 00:15:58,630
It seems you are very busy

225
00:15:58,957 --> 00:15:59,919
Make a tea for me

226
00:16:02,986 --> 00:16:06,126
What are you doing hiding from me?

227
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:09,875
I did nothing, I was away for work in Nagoya

228
00:16:11,452 --> 00:16:13,671
How can you tell such a story?

229
00:16:16,796 --> 00:16:17,569
Well then, that is ok

230
00:16:20,851 --> 00:16:21,781
You don't need to escape

231
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,124
I'll take a bath

232
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:25,531
You just told me you won't take a bath

233
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,125
I've changed my mind

234
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:37,656
I've put up with poverty for too long

235
00:16:38,242 --> 00:16:40,578
I've been trying so hard to help you

236
00:16:40,992 --> 00:16:43,929
You're going to say that until you die

237
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:47,930
I think I've paid my debt to your house well

238
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:02,875
Well....Don't be self-serving in your logic.
You gave it back or you didn't give it back

239
00:17:04,647 --> 00:17:06,459
You're going to shirk your responsibility

240
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:09,569
You told my father you wanted me

241
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,623
You asked for it seriously

242
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:18,006
You're a human being, and you've done this to me

243
00:17:18,436 --> 00:17:19,881
Stop it

244
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,090
You took me away from our home and you married him

245
00:17:24,269 --> 00:17:26,754
I hate that attitude of yours

246
00:17:29,011 --> 00:17:29,941
All is your falut

247
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:42,441
You are so mean

248
00:17:44,942 --> 00:17:47,082
Where are you going?

249
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:57,856
Do not be crazy

250
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,653
You are the crazy

251
00:18:28,743 --> 00:18:29,837
Where are you going?

252
00:18:30,727 --> 00:18:32,641
I will chase you forever

253
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:03,900
Let go! I will go home

254
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,893
You don't have to go home

255
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,455
You can go wherever you want

256
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,487
I will get after you

257
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,265
Your wife is hysterical

258
00:19:52,819 --> 00:19:55,296
She act crazy, she is like that whenever I go home

259
00:19:55,742 --> 00:19:58,718
Men are selfish. You made her that way

260
00:19:59,929 --> 00:20:00,624
You made her that way

261
00:20:05,322 --> 00:20:07,823
I know a lawyer, and I'll get him to intervene

262
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,299
Who is it?

263
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:23,495
Oh Ayako, Welcome here

264
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:25,901
Hey you ,Ayako who is our cousin is here

265
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:27,050
He is Asai

266
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:27,815
Welcome

267
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:30,376
Please come in

268
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:37,431
You have grown a lot

269
00:20:38,829 --> 00:20:39,907
Did you finish high school?

270
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:41,454
I graduated high school last year

271
00:20:42,822 --> 00:20:43,689
Come in

272
00:20:46,009 --> 00:20:47,072
So both of you are fine?

273
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:47,712
Yes

274
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,806
Your yonger brother and sister too?

275
00:20:50,322 --> 00:20:50,790
Yes

276
00:20:51,463 --> 00:20:52,783
I have six siblings

277
00:20:52,986 --> 00:20:55,627
My brother has been nagging me lately

278
00:20:58,043 --> 00:20:59,871
I heard your grandmother had a bent back

279
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:00,550
Yes

280
00:21:00,847 --> 00:21:01,699
She is fine

281
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:04,004
Hey you, our grandmom is 68 years old

282
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:05,247
She has a long life

283
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:06,536
Wanna eat toast?

284
00:21:06,872 --> 00:21:07,778
You haven't had breakfast yet, right?

285
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,989
No, I had breakfast on train

286
00:21:11,708 --> 00:21:14,637
I will go to Urawa today.
My errands will be over soon

287
00:21:15,301 --> 00:21:16,879
Let's go to an eel restaurant

288
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:18,309
That sounds good

289
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,160
Shall we bring her too?

290
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:21,739
No problem

291
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:23,427
I thought I will treat you a meal

292
00:21:26,989 --> 00:21:28,349
I like these springs

293
00:21:28,934 --> 00:21:30,848
It's a car that only the president class can drive

294
00:21:31,777 --> 00:21:33,965
It's a great privilege for a salesman to be able to drive a car like this

295
00:21:42,161 --> 00:21:44,606
Here is good.
Here's in the middle of a rice field

296
00:21:46,247 --> 00:21:47,356
I feel like I'm back in the country

297
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,793
She wants to learn dressmaking

298
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:53,364
Is it right?

299
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:56,706
Sorry for keeing you wait

300
00:21:56,956 --> 00:21:58,238
It's good to learn dressmaking

301
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:01,050
When you leave school in Tokyo, you can get a job in the country

302
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:05,680
She'll work and go to school, but I wonder
 if she has a job anywhere

303
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,328
I have no idea

304
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,559
It's hard to work and go to school at the same time

305
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:11,911
Can we let her live in my house?

306
00:22:12,591 --> 00:22:13,004
Sure

307
00:22:14,137 --> 00:22:15,364
You should ask him too

308
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:17,742
Please

309
00:22:23,632 --> 00:22:25,663
It's nice to have someone to talk to, too

310
00:22:54,743 --> 00:22:55,704
Mmmmm...

311
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,614
I thought you got married

312
00:23:03,286 --> 00:23:05,739
Do not call me old woman.
I'm still 25 years old

313
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:09,663
I'm so tired.
I ate a lot of eel

314
00:23:12,382 --> 00:23:13,749
So you are mistress

315
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:20,188
We will get married later

316
00:23:22,048 --> 00:23:23,860
Our family thinks you get married

317
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:25,937
Because you ordered a copy of the family register

318
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,523
Don't just stand there, make some tea

319
00:23:32,374 --> 00:23:33,741
You said you will get married

320
00:23:34,522 --> 00:23:36,194
so you will kick Asai's wife out?

321
00:23:37,546 --> 00:23:39,694
Rural areas and Tokyo are different environments

322
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,538
You don't understand what I think of

323
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:58,888
Hey you, why you plan to go to dressmaking school?

324
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:00,552
I thought you will get married

325
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:03,796
I'm not at ease, so I left the home

326
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:06,388
In your btother's letter

327
00:24:06,521 --> 00:24:07,927
The house of the other person, Mr. Muro

328
00:24:08,498 --> 00:24:10,209
They run a large orchard

329
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:11,271
Where is the tea?

330
00:24:13,131 --> 00:24:14,654
You can look for them there

331
00:24:14,974 --> 00:24:17,037
You will work with us from now

332
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:21,059
Why you don't marry him?

333
00:24:21,614 --> 00:24:23,715
I don't like the life in country side

334
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:28,869
And he's the president of the youth association,
even though he's young, and he's very serious

335
00:24:30,096 --> 00:24:33,471
He is good man. It is hard to find serious man

336
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:35,314
I'm not into serious man

337
00:24:35,728 --> 00:24:37,127
I want to fall in love and get married

338
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:40,776
Someone come

339
00:24:48,284 --> 00:24:48,635
Oh

340
00:24:49,627 --> 00:24:50,331
Is Masuko in?

341
00:24:52,542 --> 00:24:53,268
I'm here

342
00:24:54,073 --> 00:24:54,643
Hey Yuki

343
00:24:59,815 --> 00:25:03,167
I though I visited wrong house.
Who is she?

344
00:25:04,409 --> 00:25:05,605
She is a daugher of my brother, Eiko

345
00:25:06,753 --> 00:25:08,292
She didn't want to get married, so she left her home

346
00:25:08,487 --> 00:25:09,941
She wants to learn dressmaking

347
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:17,136
Asai-san is coming here tonight?

348
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,832
I don't know

349
00:25:19,993 --> 00:25:20,555
What's wrong?

350
00:25:21,672 --> 00:25:25,016
Actually, Aoyagi is going to work

351
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:28,539
So I want you to let me stay here

352
00:25:29,086 --> 00:25:30,977
I see. What kind of work he will do?

353
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,086
He will cheat a woman

354
00:25:36,397 --> 00:25:39,999
While he was selling fake paintings.

355
00:25:40,491 --> 00:25:42,702
He'd met the daughter of a rich politician

356
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,358
I see

357
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:46,647
So he will take money from her

358
00:25:47,327 --> 00:25:48,600
Kind of

359
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,468
He's terrible

360
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:54,286
Finally we will be worst

361
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:58,200
What are you doing there, Eiko?

362
00:25:59,223 --> 00:25:59,926
You should go to bed

363
00:26:05,994 --> 00:26:07,392
It's ok if you stay here tonight

364
00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:15,837
It's hard to live alone, isn't it?

365
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:17,454
It's ok if I get used to it

366
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:20,157
My wide die 5 years ago

367
00:26:21,132 --> 00:26:22,733
Since then, I'm having single life

368
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:24,639
Don't you get married again?

369
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:27,319
I enjoy my single life

370
00:26:27,609 --> 00:26:29,265
My father got married 4 times

371
00:26:30,187 --> 00:26:31,765
Current wife is still 23 years old

372
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,431
She is just like my older sister

373
00:26:33,533 --> 00:26:36,674
It's good that your father is being young

374
00:26:38,065 --> 00:26:41,018
My father may be filthy, but I also have a lot of sympathy for him

375
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:44,970
A man is lonely when he's alone

376
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:48,611
Me too

377
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,751
I feel lonely

378
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:53,907
Do I make you feel less lonely?

379
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,024
I didn't mean that

380
00:26:58,213 --> 00:26:59,307
It's ok if I kiss you

381
00:27:02,424 --> 00:27:03,487
Kiss me

382
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:11,901
You are good at kissing

383
00:27:20,248 --> 00:27:22,381
You can't do more

384
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:23,245
Why?

385
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:26,222
Because I won't be able to marry into a good place

386
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,711
A woman still has to get married

387
00:27:31,757 --> 00:27:33,257
I will keep my virgin then

388
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,423
What's wrong with you?

389
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:38,399
Are you upset?

390
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:41,548
Can you kiss me again?

391
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,313
Can you?

392
00:27:54,024 --> 00:27:56,087
I am a friend of Asai

393
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:59,746
As a lawyer, I'm objective

394
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:04,355
If you want to avoid talking and file a lawsuit,
I'll do that job

395
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:07,472
I asked her brother to come to Tokyo

396
00:28:08,132 --> 00:28:11,054
You both wanted a clean resolution

397
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:14,835
There is no clean solution

398
00:28:15,268 --> 00:28:16,338
Close your mouth

399
00:28:17,846 --> 00:28:19,323
There is no need to file a lawsuit

400
00:28:20,286 --> 00:28:23,566
Asai-san has no motivation to live with her

401
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:31,662
There is divorce paperwork.
Let's talk it out

402
00:28:31,771 --> 00:28:33,763
Yes,
It's just a matter of alimony

403
00:28:34,299 --> 00:28:35,690
I want 10 million yen

404
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:37,088
Close your mouth

405
00:28:37,994 --> 00:28:39,823
Then I made this kind of paper

406
00:28:41,194 --> 00:28:43,006
Asai said he will pay 1500000yen

407
00:28:43,412 --> 00:28:46,373
He'd like it to be in monthly installments for three years

408
00:28:47,951 --> 00:28:50,154
I am not goods

409
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,411
We want 3 million yen at least

410
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,187
Asai said he can pay 1500000yen at most

411
00:28:58,374 --> 00:29:01,288
I wonder what is the main reason for divorce

412
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:05,444
Because their personalities don't match

413
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,218
Ah....

414
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:16,921
Here is nice apartment

415
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:18,566
How much is for a month?

416
00:29:20,012 --> 00:29:22,035
Ah..let's go outside

417
00:29:22,496 --> 00:29:23,183
To where?

418
00:29:23,397 --> 00:29:24,483
Let's go to Yoshiko's place

419
00:29:25,311 --> 00:29:26,725
To that old man?

420
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:28,733
It's been a long time to see him,
so Let's go

421
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:34,374
I'm back

422
00:29:36,789 --> 00:29:38,883
I will go out so Please look after home

423
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,125
If Asai call

424
00:29:42,726 --> 00:29:44,827
tell him I went to Yoshiko's place in Akasaka

425
00:29:52,077 --> 00:29:53,101
I saw a magazin

426
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,226
One couple divorces every seven minutes in Japan

427
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:59,329
I see...One couple divorces every seven minutes

428
00:30:02,892 --> 00:30:04,157
We will be one of them soon

429
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:16,892
Now for the first installment of 50,000 yen

430
00:30:17,175 --> 00:30:18,628
Please affix your seal to the receipt

431
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:21,433
You can put the seal on it

432
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:30,580
I'll give you all the stuff from my house. You can take it home

433
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,463
Ah.. here it is

434
00:30:42,479 --> 00:30:44,417
Well..that's all for now

435
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:46,175
Then see you

436
00:30:54,112 --> 00:30:54,675
Hey you

437
00:31:00,636 --> 00:31:03,542
Thank you for taking care of me for a age

438
00:31:22,582 --> 00:31:26,223
(crying)

439
00:31:26,496 --> 00:31:27,871
Stop crying

440
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,356
As I get older, the only thing I enjoy is looking at beautiful women

441
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:47,403
That's more of a retreat than anything else

442
00:31:48,526 --> 00:31:53,299
You've come to see me, and I'd like to invite you to dinner but

443
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:58,422
I'm out of money, and this house is my only asset

444
00:31:58,895 --> 00:32:01,372
I have to be stingy now

445
00:32:01,981 --> 00:32:06,262
If my money runs out, my wife runs away

446
00:32:06,287 --> 00:32:08,700
Hahahahahahahaha

447
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:09,474
Hey Yoshiko

448
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,146
Yes

449
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:13,223
We have 50 year old wine

450
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:13,730
Yes

451
00:32:13,793 --> 00:32:15,035
Can you serve it to them?

452
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:15,621
Yes

453
00:32:16,566 --> 00:32:17,199
Hey Yoshiko

454
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:18,004
Yes

455
00:32:20,775 --> 00:32:23,314
The way I'm dressed is disrespectful to my guests

456
00:32:24,033 --> 00:32:25,166
Bring Kimono to me

457
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:25,939
Yes

458
00:32:27,161 --> 00:32:28,146
Excuse me a minute?

459
00:32:33,931 --> 00:32:36,431
She is a very beautiful woman

460
00:32:36,752 --> 00:32:38,806
She's the most beautiful thing in the world

461
00:32:38,948 --> 00:32:40,940
She is more beautiful than any

462
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:43,909
Hahahahahahaha

463
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,153
He is crazy for Yoshiko

464
00:32:47,146 --> 00:32:50,591
You did a good job.
I ended up being the poor one

465
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:53,543
There is a call for you

466
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,176
Are you Masuko?

467
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:03,980
I've finished the work

468
00:33:05,715 --> 00:33:06,262
I see

469
00:33:07,707 --> 00:33:08,567
You had a hard time, hadn't you?

470
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:12,598
I didn't want to stay home, so I came outside

471
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,403
Then I will be waiting here

472
00:33:19,216 --> 00:33:21,505
I heard her brother works for the prefectural government

473
00:33:23,247 --> 00:33:23,935
He is very serious

474
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:25,719
He took me 2 million yen

475
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:27,790
2 million yen is cheap

476
00:33:29,243 --> 00:33:31,172
She has been with you for 7 years

477
00:33:33,985 --> 00:33:35,602
I have been patient for 7 years

478
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:45,290
Hey, What are you doing so late

479
00:33:51,744 --> 00:33:53,126
I'm picking up Asai's stuff

480
00:33:53,501 --> 00:33:54,587
Just leave it

481
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,939
Just pack it up and mail it to him

482
00:33:58,939 --> 00:34:00,596
You can throw away what you don't need over there

483
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,642
I can't do that

484
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:06,367
I don't want to look at his stuff, even his socks

485
00:34:07,195 --> 00:34:08,024
I'll leave them all , then I go home

486
00:34:13,866 --> 00:34:17,374
You should get some rest

487
00:34:21,671 --> 00:34:23,812
Asai is so stupid

488
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:28,323
He'd been duped by a water girl

489
00:34:40,773 --> 00:34:42,265
Let's toast,Ms

490
00:34:44,046 --> 00:34:45,461
Thank you for your work

491
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,156
Congratulations

492
00:34:50,906 --> 00:34:53,687
But I'll make it clear

493
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,578
It's your turn next

494
00:34:56,321 --> 00:34:57,610
What are you talking about?

495
00:34:58,375 --> 00:34:59,039
Is that so?

496
00:35:00,386 --> 00:35:01,424
Let's get married right away

497
00:35:02,362 --> 00:35:04,175
I will move to your place from tonight

498
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:09,105
I guess your ex wife's got a grudge against me

499
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:12,378
I think so. She looked very scary

500
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:14,279
I feel very fresh now

501
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:16,201
I couldn't focus on my work

502
00:35:18,013 --> 00:35:18,880
That taught me

503
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,230
Are you sure?

504
00:35:27,154 --> 00:35:31,271
(Station Announcements)

505
00:35:31,483 --> 00:35:31,944
Brother

506
00:35:33,436 --> 00:35:34,225
Wait a minute

507
00:35:42,385 --> 00:35:42,963
Hello?

508
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:44,408
Yes

509
00:35:45,878 --> 00:35:46,745
This is Asai

510
00:35:47,885 --> 00:35:51,049
Well..Can I talk to his wife?

511
00:35:56,016 --> 00:35:56,727
Who is it?

512
00:35:56,805 --> 00:35:57,610
She says nothing

513
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,438
Hello?

514
00:36:02,008 --> 00:36:02,860
This is Asai

515
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,828
Nice to talk with you

516
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:08,344
I'm his ex-wife Yuko

517
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:11,572
Who is it?

518
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:15,033
I will go home from now

519
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:18,227
I don't begrudge anyone but

520
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,712
You're the only one I hate

521
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:22,508
Hey, stop it

522
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:27,821
From Yuko?

523
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:32,172
Hey Yuko!

524
00:36:34,922 --> 00:36:35,243
Hey Yuko!

525
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:41,236
Hey

526
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:56,027
She is so nasty

527
00:36:57,136 --> 00:36:58,488
She's sarcastic until right before she leaves

528
00:37:06,439 --> 00:37:08,439
I feel scary

529
00:37:10,142 --> 00:37:11,111
Don't worry

530
00:37:12,564 --> 00:37:13,947
Shall we go to hot spring for a change?

531
00:37:16,995 --> 00:37:18,253
That's good idea

532
00:37:18,894 --> 00:37:20,574
Let's get rid of the bad memories

533
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:22,667
Shall we bring her too?

534
00:37:23,343 --> 00:37:24,484
She have to go to school

535
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:28,648
I dont have to go shool today,
Just as well, since tomorrow is Sunday

536
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:29,953
I want to go

537
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:56,374
What's wrong? You don't eat?

538
00:38:23,831 --> 00:38:25,464
You are good dancer,Eiko

539
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,128
Anyone can do this

540
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:29,193
You're good for a country girl

541
00:38:29,639 --> 00:38:30,271
How dare you！

542
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:34,943
What's wrong?

543
00:38:35,959 --> 00:38:36,670
Give me a beer

544
00:38:40,116 --> 00:38:40,772
Let's dance

545
00:38:44,337 --> 00:38:44,900
Hey Let's dance

546
00:38:50,056 --> 00:38:51,634
It's been a long time to dance with you

547
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:07,167
It's like a honeymoon

548
00:39:10,074 --> 00:39:10,949
I'm glad We could come here

549
00:39:30,738 --> 00:39:31,465
Good night

550
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,746
Good night

551
00:39:33,289 --> 00:39:34,218
You should go to bed early

552
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:36,500
Tomorrow we'll go around Izu and return to Tokyo

553
00:40:08,795 --> 00:40:09,826
Hmm...

554
00:40:10,444 --> 00:40:10,717
Hmmm..

555
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:14,486
It's good to travel sometime

556
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:17,424
We can go for traverl sometime

557
00:40:17,986 --> 00:40:18,791
Only us?

558
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,822
Hahahahaha

559
00:40:32,985 --> 00:40:34,353
So we go to bed

560
00:40:35,196 --> 00:40:35,720
Yes

561
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:38,329
It's warm tonight

562
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,273
Wait wait!

563
00:40:47,295 --> 00:40:48,201
Why you turn off the light?

564
00:40:49,311 --> 00:40:51,068
Because...I'm shy

565
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:52,733
Are you shy?

566
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:54,287
I don't think so

567
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:58,170
It's like we're on our honeymoon

568
00:41:22,862 --> 00:41:24,744
Do you drink whisky?

569
00:41:25,151 --> 00:41:28,330
It's daytime, but I think I'll have a little drink

570
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:32,657
This is foreign one

571
00:41:38,251 --> 00:41:39,447
This is Britsh too

572
00:41:39,954 --> 00:41:41,642
I see. It must be expensive

573
00:41:43,384 --> 00:41:44,868
I will give you one, Take it home

574
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:47,277
It's too expensive and I can't taste it

575
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:48,425
Hahahahaha

576
00:41:48,644 --> 00:41:51,644
Doesn't Eiko hate the man with a blind date?

577
00:41:52,235 --> 00:41:55,915
I don't know why Eiko hate him

578
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:58,360
His family runs a large orchard

579
00:41:58,938 --> 00:42:02,009
He has a reputation for being serious

580
00:42:02,321 --> 00:42:04,689
I think Eiko hate too serious guy

581
00:42:05,018 --> 00:42:07,861
People laugh at you in the country when you say that

582
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:12,651
It would be convenient for Eiko to marry into Muro's family

583
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:16,018
I've been thinking about planting pears in the thicket behind my house

584
00:42:16,697 --> 00:42:18,838
You've been thinking about it

585
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:21,169
They said they will give us 500,000 yen for the deposit

586
00:42:22,169 --> 00:42:24,404
So you're more dedicated than she is

587
00:42:24,433 --> 00:42:25,832
That's good for her too

588
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:28,769
They've got 50, 60 million in assets

589
00:42:31,355 --> 00:42:33,238
So you got married?

590
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:37,074
We've been planning to do that from the beginning,
we just extended it a bit

591
00:42:37,745 --> 00:42:38,690
That's good for you anyway

592
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:42,924
I'd heard you lived in an apartment,
so I figured it was no big deal

593
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:44,986
But this place is gorgeous

594
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:47,389
The rent must be high

595
00:42:47,888 --> 00:42:48,849
It costs 55000yen

596
00:42:49,053 --> 00:42:49,615
What?

597
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:51,060
55000yen?

598
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,818
How much you spend money in a month?

599
00:42:54,247 --> 00:42:55,357
I spend 100000yen for eating

600
00:42:55,755 --> 00:42:58,294
We spend 15000yen for 7 people

601
00:42:58,755 --> 00:42:59,669
That's a luxury

602
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:01,591
Rural Fukushima and Tokyo are different

603
00:43:03,991 --> 00:43:06,022
Mr.Asai earn money a lot?

604
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,514
He is not only working as car sells man but also do stock exchange

605
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:12,385
So brother, when you return him money?

606
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:13,948
You are already $400,000 in debt.

607
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,627
If the orchard goes well, I'll pay him back

608
00:43:17,322 --> 00:43:18,470
Can I borrow another 100000yen ?

609
00:43:19,267 --> 00:43:21,439
You're brazen

610
00:43:21,925 --> 00:43:24,207
How can you ask for a loan without giving it back?

611
00:43:24,636 --> 00:43:26,902
When Eiko will return from school?

612
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:42,173
Hey brother

613
00:43:45,065 --> 00:43:45,995
Oh Eiko

614
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,339
What's wrong? Your father is here to pick you up

615
00:43:50,117 --> 00:43:53,132
I don't feel like going home

616
00:43:54,366 --> 00:43:57,476
But your father has come to bring you back

617
00:44:05,379 --> 00:44:06,051
Hello?

618
00:44:07,496 --> 00:44:07,832
Sis...

619
00:44:08,863 --> 00:44:09,613
From your wife

620
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:14,472
Hello?

621
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:16,228
Yes she just came here

622
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:18,517
Um

623
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:19,845
Um

624
00:44:22,006 --> 00:44:22,952
I will tell her but..

625
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:26,475
Ok I get it

626
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,289
He will go home by train in the late evening

627
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,336
He said you have to go back right away

628
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:38,250
I don't like it

629
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:39,883
You don't go home easily so

630
00:44:40,524 --> 00:44:42,867
Your father might think we're holding you back

631
00:44:45,586 --> 00:44:47,703
I will be back in Tokyo if I return to home

632
00:44:50,469 --> 00:44:52,305
I hear Mr. Muro is a good man

633
00:44:52,604 --> 00:44:53,573
You'd better marry him

634
00:44:55,307 --> 00:44:57,487
You're not responsible for me

635
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,087
I didn't mean that

636
00:45:04,603 --> 00:45:05,869
I'm a distraction

637
00:45:06,828 --> 00:45:08,446
Don't be so backward

638
00:45:10,321 --> 00:45:12,461
Never mind.
I will go home

639
00:45:23,014 --> 00:45:24,381
What the hell is wrong with your life?

640
00:45:25,248 --> 00:45:27,561
Living in a $55,000 apartment is too extravagant

641
00:45:29,137 --> 00:45:32,919
Why don't you move into a 15,000yen room and save up 40,000yen

642
00:45:34,057 --> 00:45:36,572
I don't know how people can live like this

643
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:39,369
That's normal human life

644
00:45:40,128 --> 00:45:44,073
I don't understand people who save all the time and live in poverty

645
00:45:46,099 --> 00:45:49,903
It's living like that that makes you a bad woman

646
00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:54,371
Hey Dad,You're always borrowing money from him,
and you can't talk shit like that?

647
00:46:06,886 --> 00:46:09,277
I'll be doing a sales play with Mr. Aoyagi

648
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:11,894
We are not only go around Kyushu

649
00:46:12,339 --> 00:46:14,261
I heard we'll be going as far as southern Kyushu

650
00:46:14,522 --> 00:46:16,671
Go on like it's your honeymoon

651
00:46:17,499 --> 00:46:18,757
So When you depart?

652
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:20,085
It's tomorrow

653
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:23,020
So I have a favor of you

654
00:46:27,564 --> 00:46:28,494
20000yen is enough?

655
00:46:29,088 --> 00:46:31,088
I'm sorry I always borrow money from you

656
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,017
Never mind

657
00:46:32,869 --> 00:46:33,392
Here it is

658
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,742
Being woman is boring

659
00:46:38,914 --> 00:46:42,078
Women can be happy or unhappy depending on the man

660
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:45,066
You are so lucky

661
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:47,675
You have much luck with men

662
00:46:50,582 --> 00:46:51,207
Hello?

663
00:46:52,066 --> 00:46:53,050
From Kasaoka

664
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:53,878
Kasaoka?

665
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:54,964
Asai's ex

666
00:46:56,175 --> 00:46:58,831
Hello? Asai is out now

667
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:00,527
Hun

668
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:02,558
Hun

669
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:04,810
Oh right

670
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,865
OK OK I will tell him

671
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:11,709
What?

672
00:47:12,467 --> 00:47:13,076
Kasaoka?

673
00:47:14,225 --> 00:47:15,592
I send her money every month

674
00:47:16,896 --> 00:47:20,240
I heard your ex wife is kind of dangerous. Why don't you go and help her?

675
00:47:21,802 --> 00:47:25,098
She says so, but she's going to use me

676
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:27,458
Anyway, I'm out of her life

677
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:30,348
She might think I don't let you go

678
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:32,270
So Please go

679
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:35,059
Why I have to go to help her for you?

680
00:47:35,702 --> 00:47:36,741
That's easy for you to say

681
00:47:37,257 --> 00:47:38,319
Put yourself in my shoes

682
00:47:38,686 --> 00:47:42,037
In her last letter,It says she were so mad

683
00:47:42,186 --> 00:47:44,219
They're putting her in the attic

684
00:47:44,624 --> 00:47:46,382
Hello? Hello?

685
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:47,585
Hello?

686
00:47:53,641 --> 00:47:54,688
About your ex wife?

687
00:47:56,438 --> 00:47:57,594
She is about to die

688
00:48:00,149 --> 00:48:02,203
She said she wants to see me

689
00:48:06,931 --> 00:48:08,259
I don't know why she is over me

690
00:48:09,157 --> 00:48:10,626
I've talked to the Shokuta company

691
00:48:14,126 --> 00:48:14,728
Oh good

692
00:48:16,704 --> 00:48:18,657
At times like this, business is going the other way

693
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:19,486
Hum

694
00:48:22,731 --> 00:48:24,574
Men are heartless

695
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:27,621
There is no choice

696
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:31,241
A relationship between a man and a woman begins with likes and dislikes

697
00:48:32,593 --> 00:48:35,750
Once you hate him, you can't love him again

698
00:48:36,437 --> 00:48:37,601
That's about it?

699
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:06,012
Is Asai coming?

700
00:49:07,253 --> 00:49:07,754
Asai...

701
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,129
What did he say?

702
00:49:15,843 --> 00:49:16,835
Mom...

703
00:49:19,237 --> 00:49:22,471
You made a call for me

704
00:49:23,354 --> 00:49:24,159
To Tokyo

705
00:49:29,329 --> 00:49:31,024
Is Asai coming?

706
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:32,305
Yuko

707
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:35,434
Did you call him?

708
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:39,512
Yuko

709
00:49:40,621 --> 00:49:42,777
I want to meet Asai

710
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:48,559
Yuko

711
00:49:49,325 --> 00:49:50,934
I believe Asai will come

712
00:49:50,997 --> 00:49:51,512
Please take a rest

713
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:57,997
That woman...

714
00:49:59,887 --> 00:50:02,348
That woman don't let him come here

715
00:50:13,069 --> 00:50:13,804
Grrrrrr...

716
00:50:17,124 --> 00:50:17,584
Yuko

717
00:50:17,944 --> 00:50:18,647
What are you doing?

718
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:19,835
Asai..

719
00:50:20,694 --> 00:50:23,460
What happend about Asai?

720
00:50:25,027 --> 00:50:25,808
Let go

721
00:50:28,238 --> 00:50:28,644
Yuko

722
00:50:32,437 --> 00:50:32,905
Asai..

723
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:35,913
Asai..!!

724
00:50:37,155 --> 00:50:38,304
She is like mad

725
00:50:40,546 --> 00:50:40,905
Yuko

726
00:50:41,514 --> 00:50:42,983
Are you OK, Yuko?

727
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:48,131
Asai..

728
00:50:50,955 --> 00:50:51,595
Asai..

729
00:50:55,291 --> 00:50:55,720
Yuko!

730
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:57,900
Yuko!

731
00:50:58,572 --> 00:50:59,002
Yuko!

732
00:51:09,174 --> 00:51:11,549
Shall we send incense after all?

733
00:51:17,247 --> 00:51:18,161
We should send

734
00:51:18,974 --> 00:51:20,505
They contacted us by telegram

735
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,560
I have no idea.
It's up to you

736
00:51:25,763 --> 00:51:27,373
We'll be able to settle this

737
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:29,227
We can send 10000yen

738
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:31,962
You are idiot.
Who can send 10000yen as a incense?

739
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:34,001
2000yen is enough.
They laugh at us

740
00:51:34,626 --> 00:51:36,970
Who laugh at us.
I think they glad to recieve it

741
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:41,082
Your ex wife is dead. We have to do that much

742
00:51:41,504 --> 00:51:42,668
Why you are on their side?

743
00:51:44,521 --> 00:51:46,271
I feel bad somehow

744
00:51:47,068 --> 00:51:48,482
You're not as small-minded as you think

745
00:51:53,185 --> 00:51:54,435
Oh, what happend?

746
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:57,763
I'm back

747
00:51:58,114 --> 00:51:58,661
Anyway come in

748
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:03,974
What happend?

749
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:07,917
I have escaped from them

750
00:52:37,018 --> 00:52:39,057
I had a blind date for no choice

751
00:52:39,632 --> 00:52:41,702
My father was wearing a kimono and was very excited

752
00:52:41,843 --> 00:52:43,414
I thought about running away on the way

753
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:46,632
You're a difficult person

754
00:52:46,933 --> 00:52:49,387
I told him from the start I didn't want to

755
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:50,625
But...

756
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:53,282
If you're going to marry, you'd better be serious

757
00:52:53,985 --> 00:52:56,633
I don't want to farm in the country for the rest of my life

758
00:52:57,703 --> 00:52:59,993
Life in the city is hard enough

759
00:53:00,633 --> 00:53:01,860
It looks good, but...

760
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,188
You're living happily ever after

761
00:53:05,604 --> 00:53:06,768
Not as good as you think

762
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:08,987
So Please let me stay here again

763
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,612
But your brother may angry

764
00:53:16,714 --> 00:53:17,370
Where is grandfater?

765
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:19,823
He went to Meiji Shrine

766
00:53:20,806 --> 00:53:22,197
I knew Singapore would win

767
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,080
He's at the Meiji Shrine right now

768
00:53:24,541 --> 00:53:25,001
Yes

769
00:53:25,299 --> 00:53:26,760
God's Will

770
00:53:27,174 --> 00:53:27,666
What?

771
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:29,580
having a baby

772
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:30,814
Who?

773
00:53:31,256 --> 00:53:32,311
Me

774
00:53:32,830 --> 00:53:33,322
Oh..

775
00:53:33,705 --> 00:53:34,939
What do you mean by Oh

776
00:53:36,181 --> 00:53:36,674
It's 3 month

777
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:40,635
Grandpa is 64, right?

778
00:53:41,072 --> 00:53:42,244
His ability is 55,6

779
00:53:42,907 --> 00:53:44,820
Are you sure it's Grandpa's?

780
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:46,024
You are excuse

781
00:53:46,664 --> 00:53:48,290
It's really his baby

782
00:53:49,506 --> 00:53:50,920
I can only date one of him

783
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,522
I can't cheat him

784
00:53:53,834 --> 00:53:54,827
You did it good

785
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,225
If anything should happen to Grandpa...

786
00:53:57,577 --> 00:54:00,264
Of course people are going to kick me out

787
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,277
I was so serious

788
00:54:03,051 --> 00:54:05,527
I can have a baby and live there

789
00:54:06,277 --> 00:54:07,730
So I did my best

790
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:11,425
I wonder if I make a baby

791
00:54:12,058 --> 00:54:12,495
Good

792
00:54:13,447 --> 00:54:16,681
The only way to make a living here is to have baby

793
00:54:17,361 --> 00:54:18,330
This is the best way

794
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:22,817
But you're no longer able to bear children

795
00:54:23,301 --> 00:54:23,934
Yes true

796
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,450
I don't know if I can do that once

797
00:54:27,739 --> 00:54:30,379
I will talk about it to my doctor

798
00:54:31,372 --> 00:54:33,231
You might be able to manage

799
00:54:36,496 --> 00:54:37,066
Leave it to you

800
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,738
Serve me a beer

801
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:48,387
Sure

802
00:55:20,563 --> 00:55:21,430
Good taste

803
00:55:22,039 --> 00:55:23,391
Wanna have a drink?

804
00:55:23,588 --> 00:55:25,471
I can't drink

805
00:55:31,885 --> 00:55:33,596
Are you drinking?

806
00:55:36,588 --> 00:55:37,939
Yes, You want to drink?

807
00:55:38,266 --> 00:55:39,399
I want

808
00:55:53,585 --> 00:55:56,077
I think I'm thinking of having a baby

809
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:57,592
It's good right?

810
00:55:58,325 --> 00:56:01,263
It's ok but can you?

811
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:03,571
I talked with Yoshiko

812
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:06,516
I went there because there's a good doctor

813
00:56:07,009 --> 00:56:07,532
Oh right

814
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,355
I've heard that once you can't have a baby, it's impossible

815
00:56:10,675 --> 00:56:11,980
According to the doctor

816
00:56:12,378 --> 00:56:14,503
She said if I stay in the hospital for half a month, I'll be able to give birth

817
00:56:15,324 --> 00:56:16,340
So I begged her

818
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,934
It works well?

819
00:56:30,367 --> 00:56:32,094
You can use bath, Eiko

820
00:56:57,719 --> 00:56:58,742
Sorry to bother you so late at night

821
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,766
Is this Asai's residence?

822
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:02,785
Yes we are

823
00:57:03,214 --> 00:57:04,628
I'm Muro from Fukushima

824
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,050
Sorry for the sudden visit

825
00:57:08,736 --> 00:57:11,236
Is Eiko Yoshioka here?

826
00:57:24,428 --> 00:57:24,842
Who was it?

827
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:26,811
Eiko's marriage partner

828
00:57:27,686 --> 00:57:29,123
Why he visited us so late at night

829
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:33,257
He came directly from Fukushima.
He wanted to see Eiko

830
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:34,430
Tell him she is not here

831
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:36,542
I can't do that

832
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,659
He talked my brother then came here

833
00:57:40,942 --> 00:57:42,926
There is no choice.
It's not my business

834
00:57:43,223 --> 00:57:44,700
I'm in trouble too

835
00:57:44,731 --> 00:57:45,817
You can refuse politely

836
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:47,606
Eiko also does not like him

837
00:57:58,451 --> 00:57:59,373
Mr Muro visit us

838
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:01,263
Tell him I'm not here

839
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,373
He knows that's a lie

840
00:58:03,701 --> 00:58:05,146
I don't care if it's a lie

841
00:58:05,349 --> 00:58:06,482
I don't want to see him

842
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:09,191
It's rude to visit a place like this

843
00:58:10,957 --> 00:58:13,551
Sorry to bother you so late at night

844
00:58:14,595 --> 00:58:17,674
I'm planning on taking the last train home tonight

845
00:58:18,408 --> 00:58:20,166
I know it's rude of me, but I had to visit

846
00:58:21,935 --> 00:58:23,810
Is Eiko here?

847
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:25,372
I'm sorry but

848
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,169
She is absent now

849
00:58:30,303 --> 00:58:33,702
She said she stays at classmate's home tonight

850
00:58:35,584 --> 00:58:36,420
I see

851
00:58:37,302 --> 00:58:38,349
She is not here

852
00:58:38,568 --> 00:58:40,193
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you, even though you took the time to come

853
00:58:42,771 --> 00:58:43,677
Then

854
00:58:53,631 --> 00:58:56,772
I'm sorry to have to say this

855
00:58:57,607 --> 00:59:00,404
I"m thinking of getting married with her

856
00:59:01,478 --> 00:59:04,493
Your father gave me permission to do so

857
00:59:05,548 --> 00:59:06,845
Do you know about that?

858
00:59:07,408 --> 00:59:09,439
Yes I have heard about that

859
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:18,461
When she came home

860
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,304
We had a blind date

861
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:23,809
She came here before I heard back from her

862
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:27,411
I can't give up

863
00:59:27,817 --> 00:59:30,200
so I have come here

864
00:59:31,641 --> 00:59:34,766
When she back home tomorrow, I will tell her about that

865
00:59:35,548 --> 00:59:36,720
Please go home tonight

866
00:59:36,970 --> 00:59:37,415
Yes

867
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:40,506
I will tell her to write a letter for you

868
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,576
Well...not a letter but I want to see her in real

869
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,272
Please come back another day

870
00:59:49,311 --> 00:59:52,920
Well...Would you ask her about our mariage?

871
00:59:53,366 --> 00:59:56,241
It depends on how she feels

872
00:59:57,702 --> 00:59:58,248
Yes..

873
01:00:03,507 --> 01:00:04,281
atchoo!

874
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:29,085
Who is it?

875
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:38,411
I got you some sherbet

876
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:42,122
Every day I do this, I feel like a sick person

877
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,427
Ah...

878
01:00:43,864 --> 01:00:45,052
Melon too

879
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,515
When I visited Asai's shop just before

880
01:00:48,796 --> 01:00:50,320
He was just in Kanda

881
01:00:51,072 --> 01:00:53,072
He bought this at Sudacho

882
01:00:54,947 --> 01:00:55,791
Mmmmm...

883
01:00:56,713 --> 01:00:58,041
He goes home every night?

884
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:01,437
Yes he leaves home in the early morning

885
01:01:01,476 --> 01:01:03,515
Umm...I feel very pain

886
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:06,781
I don't want to see the doctor every day

887
01:01:07,218 --> 01:01:10,312
They're going to make it possible for you to have a baby,
so you have to be patient

888
01:01:10,851 --> 01:01:12,117
Yes that's right but...

889
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,640
Mr.Muro has asked you again?

890
01:01:16,055 --> 01:01:16,859
I got a letter from him

891
01:01:17,539 --> 01:01:19,023
I feel very weird

892
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:21,687
It was like a love letter

893
01:01:22,203 --> 01:01:23,782
He is really loving you

894
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:27,016
People like that will take care of you very well

895
01:01:29,636 --> 01:01:30,613
I don't like

896
01:01:31,902 --> 01:01:32,988
Shall I cut the melon?

897
01:01:33,245 --> 01:01:34,417
I'll have it later so don't worry

898
01:01:34,949 --> 01:01:35,402
OK

899
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:37,219
Then I'll make it cool

900
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,225
I hate the sound of this crow

901
01:01:46,303 --> 01:01:48,624
Hey you, how long will it take for?

902
01:01:49,167 --> 01:01:50,604
I guess 4 or 5 days more

903
01:01:52,386 --> 01:01:54,292
I miss home day by day

904
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:57,367
I put the curtains in the wash

905
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,617
I'll clean up your room until you get back

906
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:01,649
Eiko

907
01:02:02,399 --> 01:02:02,945
What?

908
01:02:04,125 --> 01:02:06,406
You're all tense. What's wrong?

909
01:02:08,842 --> 01:02:09,701
You think so?

910
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:14,748
Asai always carries a dirty handkerchief in his pocket

911
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,037
You need to take care of it

912
01:02:16,561 --> 01:02:17,944
Ok I will

913
01:02:18,615 --> 01:02:19,311
Thank you

914
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,897
I will see you again

915
01:02:56,257 --> 01:02:56,882
I'm home

916
01:03:00,031 --> 01:03:00,836
Welcome back

917
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,336
I had a dinner already

918
01:03:11,057 --> 01:03:12,862
Would you like coffee or tea?

919
01:03:13,787 --> 01:03:16,028
I'll have a beer after shower

920
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,355
Was Masuko ok?

921
01:03:51,041 --> 01:03:53,330
She said she returns in 4 or 5 days

922
01:04:30,995 --> 01:04:32,003
Come here with me

923
01:04:34,862 --> 01:04:36,745
Hey, come on

924
01:04:43,925 --> 01:04:44,815
Stop it

925
01:04:47,456 --> 01:04:48,535
Never mind

926
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:52,730
You said you'd only do it once

927
01:04:54,205 --> 01:04:55,393
It's same once or twice

928
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,213
You are very cute

929
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:04,111
I feel bad for my sister

930
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:05,346
This is bad

931
01:05:20,146 --> 01:05:20,841
You're a thief

932
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:25,856
How can you do this

933
01:05:34,327 --> 01:05:36,475
What do you mean by that?

934
01:05:37,538 --> 01:05:38,390
I'll kill you

935
01:05:45,969 --> 01:05:46,625
I'll kill you

936
01:06:59,355 --> 01:07:00,347
Stop it! You are crazy

937
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:03,253
You made me crazy

938
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:07,627
You're a thief cat

939
01:07:49,287 --> 01:07:50,045
Hey you

940
01:07:51,444 --> 01:07:54,467
What do you want from me?

941
01:07:55,397 --> 01:07:57,498
I don't know what I can..

942
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:00,623
Not a particularly close relationship

943
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:03,232
If you want to just play

944
01:08:04,303 --> 01:08:05,788
find another girl

945
01:08:09,718 --> 01:08:11,437
It's bad you slept with Eiko

946
01:08:15,018 --> 01:08:15,916
I'm sorry

947
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:18,823
I apologize for that

948
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:24,940
I didn't think you were

949
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:28,706
When she came to the hospital,
she was acting strange

950
01:08:30,368 --> 01:08:31,470
When I returned home, then..

951
01:08:42,475 --> 01:08:42,890
Hey

952
01:08:43,975 --> 01:08:44,639
What you willo do?

953
01:08:48,077 --> 01:08:51,030
By the looks of it, she's not going anywhere

954
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,149
I was very sorry, Sis

955
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,750
Sorry doesn't cut it

956
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:24,461
Because Asai-san forced me

957
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:26,078
You were into that

958
01:10:26,516 --> 01:10:28,633
If you really don't like it, bite your tongue off and die

959
01:10:30,305 --> 01:10:31,406
I'm sorry

960
01:10:32,587 --> 01:10:33,907
I'm really sorry

961
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:38,806
Leave our home tomorrow

962
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:42,554
Find a boarding house nearby

963
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:43,499
Move there

964
01:11:14,386 --> 01:11:16,105
I didn't think she'd do something like that

965
01:11:18,722 --> 01:11:20,574
I can't trust anyone now

966
01:11:22,113 --> 01:11:23,355
She is cute girl so

967
01:11:24,285 --> 01:11:27,168
A man like Asai tend to like her

968
01:11:28,305 --> 01:11:29,164
I had bad luck

969
01:11:31,227 --> 01:11:33,805
I took him from ex wife, now other girl took him

970
01:11:36,039 --> 01:11:38,297
Hey, that man called Muro

971
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,828
The Youth Chairman who love Eiko

972
01:11:41,830 --> 01:11:43,548
You shoud match make them

973
01:11:44,494 --> 01:11:45,830
But Eiko hate him

974
01:11:46,517 --> 01:11:48,025
You should manage it

975
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:50,132
If you blackmail her into marrying him

976
01:11:51,156 --> 01:11:53,945
If you don't, she'll take Asai-san

977
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:56,186
You think so?

978
01:11:57,138 --> 01:11:58,411
Pull yourself together

979
01:11:58,919 --> 01:12:02,419
Between a man and a woman,
the one who is vague loses

980
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,156
Be positive for everything

981
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:07,023
I dont feel like doing it

982
01:12:08,139 --> 01:12:10,359
How is your health now?

983
01:12:11,019 --> 01:12:12,167
Can you have baby now?

984
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:14,449
The doctor says I'm ok

985
01:12:16,091 --> 01:12:18,709
Look, I am like this now

986
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:21,521
Sometime he moves

987
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:23,633
This is good

988
01:12:32,461 --> 01:12:35,758
Eiko does not like you so much

989
01:12:36,906 --> 01:12:40,016
How can I say...I remeber that

990
01:12:40,977 --> 01:12:44,273
She's been afraid of marriage since she was a child

991
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:48,718
But she can feel calm and rediscover herself now

992
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,296
I think she is ready for marrige now

993
01:12:52,944 --> 01:12:54,155
Thank you for everything

994
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:57,976
Please talk with her about something

995
01:12:58,702 --> 01:13:00,585
Yes, I get it

996
01:13:06,272 --> 01:13:07,734
Oh my god

997
01:13:08,754 --> 01:13:10,934
She saw us doing flirting

998
01:13:11,348 --> 01:13:13,129
Hahahaha but

999
01:13:13,645 --> 01:13:16,040
Having sex with your wife's niece is indiscreet

1000
01:13:16,361 --> 01:13:17,415
You are right but

1001
01:13:19,064 --> 01:13:21,056
She teased me when we were at home

1002
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:23,577
Hey, she has come

1003
01:13:49,085 --> 01:13:49,983
Can you serve me a juice?

1004
01:14:00,132 --> 01:14:01,054
How's the boarding house?

1005
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:06,343
Mr. Muro came to see me today

1006
01:14:07,915 --> 01:14:08,969
Your wife invited him

1007
01:14:09,664 --> 01:14:10,579
I see. He came

1008
01:14:11,946 --> 01:14:13,274
I'm sure you know that

1009
01:14:14,279 --> 01:14:15,459
You talked with her then invited him

1010
01:14:16,990 --> 01:14:19,466
Masuko really wanted to invite him

1011
01:14:21,914 --> 01:14:24,430
I'm already a distraction

1012
01:14:34,256 --> 01:14:35,780
I didn't mean that,Eiko

1013
01:14:36,968 --> 01:14:38,624
Why you don't see me at boarding house?

1014
01:14:41,132 --> 01:14:42,944
I will be in big trouble if she knows

1015
01:14:44,716 --> 01:14:46,326
She put me out of her way

1016
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:52,753
From now

1017
01:14:53,777 --> 01:14:56,753
Your wife and Mr.Muro and I are supposed to meet at Ginza

1018
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:58,042
I see

1019
01:14:58,947 --> 01:15:00,649
Then I will take you there

1020
01:15:02,064 --> 01:15:04,142
Don't worry, I will catch a cab

1021
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:06,158
By cab?

1022
01:15:11,749 --> 01:15:12,874
We are over...

1023
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:23,726
Bill please

1024
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:30,226
Recently, rural areas have been modernized

1025
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:33,101
We are willing to adopt new methods

1026
01:15:33,815 --> 01:15:36,534
Especially orchard management

1027
01:15:37,253 --> 01:15:39,886
requires scientific cultivation methods

1028
01:15:40,519 --> 01:15:43,793
Our young farmers form study group

1029
01:15:44,441 --> 01:15:46,504
I see. You have a hard time

1030
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:51,134
I'm thinking of going to California next year for a field trip

1031
01:15:52,306 --> 01:15:54,212
He is good man,Eiko

1032
01:15:54,323 --> 01:15:56,010
You can go with him

1033
01:15:57,416 --> 01:15:58,479
Shall we go together?

1034
01:16:03,461 --> 01:16:05,485
I here it is dry weather there

1035
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:08,156
Yes,It's a good climate for growing oranges

1036
01:16:08,777 --> 01:16:12,683
It's very humid here, so cultivation requires a lot of skill

1037
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:14,769
Anyway please drink

1038
01:16:14,847 --> 01:16:15,550
Thank you

1039
01:16:29,187 --> 01:16:29,922
What you will do?

1040
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:38,343
You should reply him

1041
01:16:39,585 --> 01:16:40,452
I still don't like

1042
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,702
I don't want to marry with him

1043
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:45,194
He is very good and serious man

1044
01:16:45,889 --> 01:16:47,178
It's not every day you meet someone that nice

1045
01:17:01,677 --> 01:17:03,443
I decide my life on my own

1046
01:17:03,623 --> 01:17:05,959
I'm telling you straight, just for your benefit

1047
01:17:07,188 --> 01:17:08,188
just for your benefit

1048
01:17:08,704 --> 01:17:10,672
Because I'm in the way, right?

1049
01:17:11,156 --> 01:17:13,641
You plan to take Asai from me

1050
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:14,219
No!

1051
01:17:14,274 --> 01:17:14,977
True!

1052
01:17:15,571 --> 01:17:17,055
You want to rob Asai from me

1053
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:18,365
You too

1054
01:17:19,529 --> 01:17:21,608
You robbed Asai from ex his wife

1055
01:17:22,701 --> 01:17:23,490
I didn't rob!

1056
01:17:23,961 --> 01:17:25,250
He came to love me

1057
01:17:25,866 --> 01:17:26,969
Me too

1058
01:17:27,414 --> 01:17:28,726
He came to love me

1059
01:17:30,873 --> 01:17:32,076
What the hell!

1060
01:17:36,295 --> 01:17:37,139
Sis...

1061
01:17:37,765 --> 01:17:38,226
I...

1062
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:40,562
I'm not like a doll

1063
01:17:42,515 --> 01:17:44,577
I won't obey you

1064
01:17:45,281 --> 01:17:46,968
I'll do whatever I want

1065
01:17:49,116 --> 01:17:52,077
Are you going to be my love rival?

1066
01:17:53,289 --> 01:17:54,070
Yes I will

1067
01:18:24,694 --> 01:18:25,405
Let go

1068
01:18:29,778 --> 01:18:31,927
I'm gonna strangle you

1069
01:18:32,466 --> 01:18:33,107
I can't breath!

1070
01:18:33,981 --> 01:18:34,638
Let go!

1071
01:18:37,458 --> 01:18:38,247
Kill you!

1072
01:18:54,091 --> 01:18:57,068
Remember what I say, Eiko

1073
01:18:59,154 --> 01:19:00,404
If you took Asai from me

1074
01:19:01,285 --> 01:19:02,332
I will kill you

1075
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,578
You marry him!

1076
01:19:19,407 --> 01:19:20,227
You understand?

1077
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,368
If you do not follow me

1078
01:19:24,394 --> 01:19:25,839
Don’t you dare!

1079
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:29,331
You understand?

1080
01:19:30,128 --> 01:19:30,816
You get it?

1081
01:19:52,057 --> 01:19:54,760
I was finally relieved

1082
01:19:57,034 --> 01:19:58,659
I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders

1083
01:19:59,237 --> 01:20:02,331
I was relieved to save face

1084
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:05,100
How about holding their wedding in Tokyo?

1085
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,217
That's good.
Let's do it in a fancy place like the Imperial Hotel

1086
01:20:09,412 --> 01:20:10,881
That's a good idea!

1087
01:20:11,237 --> 01:20:13,057
I'm sure she will be glad

1088
01:20:15,214 --> 01:20:17,370
It's more presentable and easier to manage

1089
01:20:18,310 --> 01:20:22,505
Leaving from Tokyo Station on their honeymoon is also a good way to make theirself presentable to people in the countryside

1090
01:20:22,826 --> 01:20:25,482
Try to find a good wedding venue

1091
01:20:25,881 --> 01:20:27,139
Yes I will do it right away

1092
01:20:28,436 --> 01:20:29,249
The earlier the better?

1093
01:20:30,108 --> 01:20:32,803
Yes Let's get this done while she's still in the mood

1094
01:20:33,381 --> 01:20:36,092
Mr. Muro is easily available

1095
01:20:37,389 --> 01:20:39,443
It's all thanks to you

1096
01:20:47,507 --> 01:20:49,069
Local sales is tough

1097
01:20:49,835 --> 01:20:51,788
I once slept in a farmer's shack

1098
01:20:52,657 --> 01:20:53,891
But you earned it, right?

1099
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:58,313
We only made enough money to buy a ticket from Kagoshima to Tokyo

1100
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:00,145
That's the way it is

1101
01:21:00,918 --> 01:21:02,075
How is Aoyagi doing?

1102
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:05,184
He said we go to sell in Hokkaido

1103
01:21:06,518 --> 01:21:10,057
There's no point in struggling to stay in business
if you can't make money

1104
01:21:11,104 --> 01:21:12,377
You should separate from him

1105
01:21:13,571 --> 01:21:15,837
I've thought about leaving him many times before

1106
01:21:16,650 --> 01:21:17,540
But I couldn't

1107
01:21:18,976 --> 01:21:20,851
I like to be with such a man

1108
01:21:21,929 --> 01:21:23,695
Woman can't live alone

1109
01:21:24,445 --> 01:21:25,367
You think so?

1110
01:21:27,124 --> 01:21:29,609
You should keep Asai-san firmly

1111
01:21:30,171 --> 01:21:33,507
It's hard to keep man more than I thought

1112
01:21:34,453 --> 01:21:36,226
He has no relationship with Eiko?

1113
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,201
I have no idea

1114
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:43,627
Five more days to clean up.
I don't care if a few things go wrong

1115
01:21:45,689 --> 01:21:48,486
Hello? It's Eiko speaking

1116
01:21:49,923 --> 01:21:51,087
I want to see you for a short time

1117
01:21:58,417 --> 01:22:00,652
I'm in Shibuya now

1118
01:22:01,732 --> 01:22:04,365
Can you come to see me?

1119
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:08,958
Just a little bit is enough

1120
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:15,537
Hey, can you take me to somewhere for saying goodbye?

1121
01:22:16,845 --> 01:22:18,876
I'm on work, I can't travel far

1122
01:22:20,267 --> 01:22:22,251
I will get married soon

1123
01:22:24,313 --> 01:22:25,517
I want to say good bye to you

1124
01:22:28,891 --> 01:22:31,032
I will follow as everyone say

1125
01:22:32,830 --> 01:22:34,065
So can you do that?

1126
01:22:35,416 --> 01:22:36,549
You are bad girl

1127
01:22:39,209 --> 01:22:40,897
You seduced me

1128
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:49,758
Follow me

1129
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:05,767
Look.She's a great bride

1130
01:24:05,848 --> 01:24:08,372
You can't do that in a country beauty parlor

1131
01:24:08,872 --> 01:24:10,036
It's so wonderful

1132
01:24:16,571 --> 01:24:18,595
You are amazing.
You're magnificent

1133
01:24:19,669 --> 01:24:20,950
So Shall we go?

1134
01:24:21,294 --> 01:24:23,012
Are you going to go straight to the venue?

1135
01:24:23,051 --> 01:24:24,919
I don't want to keep them waiting. Let's get a move on

1136
01:24:56,339 --> 01:25:05,314
(The special express train for Nagoya will be departing from platform 15 shortly)

1137
01:25:05,995 --> 01:25:10,205
(Please stay back outside the white line)

1138
01:25:13,323 --> 01:25:14,112
Yes

1139
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:19,354
Then see you

1140
01:25:58,124 --> 01:25:59,616
You want to eat something?

1141
01:26:01,554 --> 01:26:02,585
I don't want

1142
01:26:03,687 --> 01:26:04,828
I'm so tired

1143
01:26:05,085 --> 01:26:06,031
Shall I prepare a bath?

1144
01:26:06,999 --> 01:26:07,679
Don't worry

1145
01:26:08,548 --> 01:26:09,118
Shall will go to bed?

1146
01:26:10,744 --> 01:26:12,251
I will make a cup of hot tea for you

1147
01:26:31,428 --> 01:26:33,397
Hi,Your tea is ready

1148
01:26:43,710 --> 01:26:47,522
We've had our problems,
but she's going to be a good wife

1149
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,701
It might be so

1150
01:26:55,316 --> 01:26:56,597
It's good to hold wedding

1151
01:26:57,933 --> 01:26:59,441
Shall we hold a wedding too?

1152
01:27:01,824 --> 01:27:02,512
That's sound good

1153
01:27:03,692 --> 01:27:05,481
It might be a good idea for us to prepare each other

1154
01:27:23,740 --> 01:27:25,302
Hey, what's wrong with you?

1155
01:27:26,224 --> 01:27:26,826
Yes

1156
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:25,648
Finish

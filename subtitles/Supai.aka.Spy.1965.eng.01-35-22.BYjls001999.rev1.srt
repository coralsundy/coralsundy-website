2
00:00:11,859 --> 00:00:13,289
We don't have much time, so we'll move on.

3
00:00:13,813 --> 00:00:14,766
The first point

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:16,785
There is a clause that
says the use of nuclear

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:20,594
weapons is necessary for
the defense of Japan in No.11

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,867
In this clause, Japan says

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:30,383
Nuclear weapons can be brought in if necessary in the future.

8
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:35,938
And No12 has the same record.

9
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:37,711
The second point

10
00:00:38,063 --> 00:00:40,203
About overseas XXX issue

11
00:00:40,453 --> 00:00:46,117
About the region of the mercenaries,
The item whether it is necessary for the operation.

12
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:51,859
Japan's territory, territorial waters, airspace, and surrounding areas.

13
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:56,063
We have no choice but to deploy troops overseas.

14
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,867
We've declared it a virtual enemy.

15
00:01:00,892 --> 00:01:02,859
But Isn't it too extreme?

16
00:01:04,445 --> 00:01:07,531
I think there is this criticism

17
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:52,117
This is a small case we don't use.

18
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:56,352
But There's something behind this case.

19
00:01:57,297 --> 00:01:59,508
I feel like that

20
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:10,219
Ok OK don't misunderstand me!

21
00:02:10,727 --> 00:02:13,156
I know how you feel

22
00:02:13,578 --> 00:02:16,336
I know but you should be patient

23
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,625
What? Yes that's it

24
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,094
OK, leave it to you

25
00:02:21,398 --> 00:02:25,976
Hey Ken-san. He doesn't feel guilty about his corruption.

26
00:02:26,836 --> 00:02:30,695
Their parents are very black-hearted.

27
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,382
They're as thick-skinned as the animal rhinoceros.

28
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:35,328
I have no idea

29
00:02:35,453 --> 00:02:37,219
They are very upset

30
00:02:37,243 --> 00:02:39,289
They have a very short temper.

31
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:42,266
It's like a little volcano

32
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,078
Hello? this is Social Affairs.

33
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:48,570
But chief...

34
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,297
Do you feel something strange?

35
00:02:51,322 --> 00:02:52,141
What?

36
00:02:52,195 --> 00:02:54,781
It's hard to break out of a Omura's prison camp.

37
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:56,188
That's true

38
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:57,937
Then we should investigate it?

39
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:58,789
To where?

40
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:00,219
I'll see what I can find out.

41
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:03,602
The Omura station said they had no new information.

42
00:03:03,914 --> 00:03:05,539
But we can try

43
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:08,047
If we're going to do this, we should call in a
specialist.

44
00:03:08,172 --> 00:03:10,938
But Travel expenses will apply.

45
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,789
Suga-Chan,Let's have a drink later

46
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:14,516
He'll be caught anyway.

47
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:15,859
But...

48
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:18,234
Another article on the Japanese conspiracy?

49
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:19,641
No way

50
00:03:19,773 --> 00:03:23,516
You tend to make for interesting posts these
days.

51
00:03:27,266 --> 00:03:28,844
What will you do,chief?

52
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:29,930
What?

53
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,203
Never mind

54
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:39,719
Your work is valuable to us.

55
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:42,164
What can I do for you?

56
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:47,406
Reporters these days are unmotivated.

57
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:50,461
No budget for business travel, they say.

58
00:03:50,727 --> 00:03:53,367
A friend of mine, a union president, put it this
way.

59
00:03:53,938 --> 00:03:56,265
The democratic forces are in the newspapers....

60
00:03:56,523 --> 00:03:57,336
Hey,Gon-Chan

61
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,430
I'll go anyway

62
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:00,156
To where?

63
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,102
To Omura

64
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:02,852
Leave the rest work to you

65
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:04,055
What about travel expenses?

66
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,047
I borrowed it in advance.

67
00:04:12,258 --> 00:04:14,078
Chuo Shimbun Social Affairs Department

68
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:19,422
I never give up on a case once I'm involved.

69
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:23,563
What happened if I didn't work for this at this
time.....

70
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:26,500
This case has gone unsolved.

71
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,289
Mr. Lee was a student at Seoul National
University, a leader of the student movement.

72
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:38,703
Last year, there was a demonstration
against the Park administration in South Korea.

73
00:04:39,555 --> 00:04:44,000
He was arrested and imprisoned for that demonstration.
But he escaped from prison at the end of last year.

74
00:04:44,727 --> 00:04:46,531
He's been arrested in the past.

75
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,305
Yes

76
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:51,461
The South Korean government did emergency procedures, but he's still in the
underworld.

77
00:04:52,109 --> 00:04:53,969
And, the 3rd of this month

78
00:04:54,164 --> 00:04:55,781
He smuggled herself to Japan.

79
00:04:56,086 --> 00:04:58,117
He wishes to stay in Japan.

80
00:04:58,344 --> 00:05:01,383
If extradited to Korea, she will be sentenced to
death.

81
00:05:02,977 --> 00:05:04,351
So he escaped and arrived in Japan.

82
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:11,664
He's on a mission to unite North and
South Korea with Koreans living in Japan.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,531
He speaks Japanese?

84
00:05:13,766 --> 00:05:15,477
He is fluent in Japanese

85
00:05:16,148 --> 00:05:19,641
He said she learn from his father.
He was in Japan for long

86
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:21,968
So her father takes care of him in Japan

87
00:05:22,914 --> 00:05:27,382
Her father's friend called Kim Yojitsu do Korean
restaurant business in Tokyo

88
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,836
Kim Yojitsu?

89
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:33,882
Is there any connection between him and the
others?

90
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:37,929
The police came by once to check it out.

91
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:39,609
What the police name?

92
00:05:40,046 --> 00:05:40,656
Well...

93
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,375
Well...Uzaki

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,390
He is a MPD's SABURO UZAKI

95
00:05:48,593 --> 00:05:49,226
Uzaki?

96
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,507
I haven't heard the name before

97
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,781
I know most of the police's name

98
00:05:55,984 --> 00:05:58,171
Has the head agency contacted you in advance?

99
00:05:58,421 --> 00:05:58,968
No

100
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:02,406
But I checked his police license card

101
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,093
No problem

102
00:06:08,336 --> 00:06:09,250
Thank you

103
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,062
I will be in main office so let me know when you
finished

104
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:31,656
He came in the morning of the day he escaped.

105
00:06:32,796 --> 00:06:33,773
I doubt the police

106
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,445
His police license card was real

107
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:41,171
But you should contact to head police office
about it

108
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,523
I see

109
00:06:42,648 --> 00:06:43,211
Call them

110
00:06:44,664 --> 00:06:47,218
Anyway he escaped that night,right?

111
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:50,171
He made his escape an hour before night roll
call.

112
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:52,265
He stole his pistol

113
00:06:52,554 --> 00:06:54,976
But The ball of the pistol was safe.

114
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,000
What the hell!

115
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:15,875
Uwaaaah!

116
00:08:06,836 --> 00:08:07,586
Move

117
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:09,601
Right away!

118
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,687
Do it!

119
00:08:37,859 --> 00:08:38,804
OK go

120
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:44,937
What are you doing? go right now

121
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:54,164
That driver reported to the police next day

122
00:08:54,687 --> 00:08:56,664
That's why we were late.

123
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,781
Do you have a specific time for carrying
groceries?

124
00:09:01,843 --> 00:09:02,866
Yes 8 pm

125
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,640
So So his escape plan was premeditated?

126
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:10,265
But He had no contact with the outside world.

127
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:15,250
Chief! There was no police exist called Uzaki

128
00:09:25,319 --> 00:09:28,007
I was very nervous

129
00:09:28,328 --> 00:09:32,203
He placed his pistol on my side.

130
00:09:33,523 --> 00:09:34,406
Go right now

131
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,976
Did you know where you were going all along?

132
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:43,109
Yes, he told me the in front of post office in
Higashi head city

133
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:47,140
Drive fast! Drive fast!

134
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,390
Don't report to police if you don't want to be
killed

135
00:09:58,554 --> 00:09:59,937
Get lost now

136
00:10:13,257 --> 00:10:14,968
What kind of the car?

137
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:16,132
It was Chevrolet

138
00:10:17,836 --> 00:10:22,000
It was night, so I could see clearly but I'm
sure It was Chevrolet

139
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,983
Yes, I'm sure

140
00:10:28,289 --> 00:10:31,179
There's something at the bottom of this case.

141
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,195
I returned to Tokyo convinced.

142
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:53,373
Welcome

143
00:10:59,373 --> 00:11:00,545
Thank you for everything

144
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:04,513
Mr.Kim, can you see this carefully again?

145
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:07,560
Doesn't he look like your best friend?

146
00:11:08,092 --> 00:11:11,685
He might look a little like him.

147
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,803
Is he really Lee's son?

148
00:11:15,318 --> 00:11:17,771
He didn't come to visit you?

149
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,638
The police have investigated and know it properly

150
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,576
Because the Japanese police are very good

151
00:11:22,928 --> 00:11:24,709
Japanese police trust me

152
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:26,623
The dish is ready

153
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:27,575
OK

154
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,029
No 2 table please

155
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:29,803
But

156
00:11:30,209 --> 00:11:33,178
This young man only knows you in Japan

157
00:11:33,576 --> 00:11:34,701
Hey reporter

158
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:37,959
He's made a premeditated escape, hasn't he?

159
00:11:38,052 --> 00:11:41,693
Does he tell Japanese officials where he is going?

160
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:45,951
But what if he really visits you?

161
00:11:46,521 --> 00:11:47,826
I will report to police

162
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:49,404
There is no choice

163
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,240
The Japanese government is cold towards Koreans.

164
00:11:52,638 --> 00:11:55,029
It also gets in the way of my business

165
00:11:57,146 --> 00:12:01,107
If he comes please let me know before telling the police

166
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,388
I won't make it worse.

167
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:06,443
I think I can't do it

168
00:12:06,646 --> 00:12:07,646
If he comes

169
00:12:09,068 --> 00:12:09,756
Dishes

170
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:10,826
OK

171
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:22,357
Hi

172
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,537
Hi

173
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,646
Oh welcome back, how was it?

174
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:52,232
I'm sorry

175
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:54,756
You don't have to apologize

176
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,217
It's been hard enough without you.

177
00:12:56,795 --> 00:12:58,162
It was worth the trip.

178
00:12:58,232 --> 00:12:58,732
Really?

179
00:12:58,857 --> 00:12:59,717
For sure

180
00:13:00,537 --> 00:13:01,303
Chief!

181
00:13:01,826 --> 00:13:02,701
There is an editorial meeting

182
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:04,467
Please talk about this

183
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:06,193
There are various topics

184
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:13,053
Then we will work on this

185
00:13:21,849 --> 00:13:22,474
Chief!

186
00:13:23,763 --> 00:13:24,701
How was it?

187
00:13:24,742 --> 00:13:25,818
Our director objected

188
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:26,381
Our director objected?

189
00:13:27,076 --> 00:13:28,287
Does that mean it's not news?

190
00:13:28,312 --> 00:13:31,482
He said he wanted more reliable data

191
00:13:32,013 --> 00:13:33,240
OK, then I'll work on it

192
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:34,950
This job has been terminated.

193
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:35,842
What?

194
00:13:35,867 --> 00:13:36,654
That's what we decided.

195
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:39,084
No way, wait!

196
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,576
Suga-Chan,It's no use talking to him

197
00:13:42,592 --> 00:13:45,841
Didn't you check Omura's case?

198
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:47,185
I did it

199
00:13:48,318 --> 00:13:49,521
It's strange

200
00:13:50,084 --> 00:13:50,599
What?

201
00:13:52,896 --> 00:13:54,599
The police aren't moving at all with that

202
00:13:55,818 --> 00:13:56,896
It's like the case has been resolved

203
00:13:57,342 --> 00:13:59,662
So Was Lee arrested?

204
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,771
He was not arrested by Japanese police

205
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:03,178
So Us army arrested him?

206
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:04,412
No

207
00:14:04,623 --> 00:14:07,810
So why do Japanese police do nothing?

208
00:14:08,865 --> 00:14:11,912
I think America is involved

209
00:14:12,506 --> 00:14:15,771
They are going to deal with the US-Japan agreement

210
00:14:16,951 --> 00:14:18,287
There's a reason for that.

211
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:20,482
Damn it

212
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,896
Against the Vietnam War!

213
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:51,763
Against the Vietnam War!

214
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:56,584
U.S. forces get out of Japan!

215
00:14:57,435 --> 00:15:01,576
U.S. forces get out of Japan!

216
00:15:25,638 --> 00:15:26,803
You have a hard time

217
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:27,982
How are you?

218
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:33,131
1 + 1 = not necessarily 2

219
00:15:33,576 --> 00:15:35,076
Do you study philosophy?

220
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,568
I thought you'd been dumped by a woman.

221
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:40,747
I've been dumped by you all year.

222
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:43,170
You have never seduced me

223
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,396
Madam?

224
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:46,021
He is calling you

225
00:15:46,092 --> 00:15:46,709
Yes

226
00:15:47,701 --> 00:15:48,748
Welcome

227
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,998
Welcome

228
00:15:55,209 --> 00:15:55,865
Please give me whiskey sour

229
00:15:55,982 --> 00:15:56,693
Sure

230
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:11,584
Another cup

231
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:12,740
Yes

232
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:18,045
Do you know her?

233
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:19,896
The Madam....

234
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:23,287
Ah

235
00:16:23,834 --> 00:16:26,506
Please call Madam for me

236
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:28,935
Madam

237
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,747
Madam

238
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,959
Thank you very much

239
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:37,583
What's wrong?

240
00:16:38,263 --> 00:16:40,068
She wants to talk with you

241
00:16:40,451 --> 00:16:41,474
Do you know her?

242
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,803
Kind of

243
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:44,599
What can I do for you?

244
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:48,185
Can I work here?

245
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:50,037
Do you talk about that suddenly?

246
00:16:51,974 --> 00:16:54,685
I have to know your identity

247
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:57,959
My identity..I'm alone

248
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:01,373
What work you did?

249
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,209
I worked at a night club

250
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:03,974
Whereabouts?

251
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:05,592
Newzabra in Yokohama

252
00:17:06,428 --> 00:17:08,435
You worked in a famous place

253
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:10,115
Why did you quit your job?

254
00:17:12,928 --> 00:17:15,951
Because I was tempted by American soldiers.

255
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:21,092
Are you really alone?
I think you are with someone

256
00:17:21,607 --> 00:17:22,974
I can't hire if I have a husband

257
00:17:23,092 --> 00:17:23,834
She doesn't have

258
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:25,974
I see

259
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,638
I trust you if you know him

260
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:30,115
what is your name?

261
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:32,443
I'm Shigeko Noriyama

262
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:35,638
Please work from tomorrow

263
00:17:35,834 --> 00:17:36,693
Thank you

264
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:38,201
Please take care of her

265
00:17:45,771 --> 00:17:47,553
Thanks to you

266
00:17:48,717 --> 00:17:49,818
I'm glad I could help you

267
00:17:52,709 --> 00:17:54,099
Let's really get to know each other.

268
00:17:57,013 --> 00:17:58,342
Here's to celebrating your employment!

269
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:03,115
Chasing her rather than chasing the criminal

270
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:06,935
I felt like that for a moment

271
00:18:14,787 --> 00:18:17,763
Do you know Uzaki?
It's been a week

272
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:20,865
Where is here?
Here is not Tokyo

273
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:24,224
I can hear the sound of the waves, but is here near the sea?

274
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:25,935
Sorry I can't talk with you

275
00:18:29,834 --> 00:18:32,482
Hi,
Do you enjoy the meal?

276
00:18:33,115 --> 00:18:37,256
Uzaki-san.
You said you'd protect me, but I'm not free.

277
00:18:37,281 --> 00:18:38,287
Here is locked

278
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:40,966
When can I go out here?

279
00:18:40,991 --> 00:18:43,060
Don't be extravagant.
Eat the meal

280
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:44,849
What will you do with me?

281
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:48,084
Of course We want you to work something later

282
00:18:48,109 --> 00:18:48,873
What will you do with me?

283
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:50,248
OK,Uzaki

284
00:18:51,662 --> 00:18:56,982
Mr.Lee.
What we want you to do is not difficult

285
00:18:57,724 --> 00:19:00,263
We want you to join a North Korean organization in Japan

286
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:02,037
A North Korean organization in Japan?

287
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:05,115
Yes,
They have a strong unity

288
00:19:05,443 --> 00:19:07,381
We can't easily get inside them

289
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:13,724
You are against the Japan-Korea talks., so I think they trust you

290
00:19:14,357 --> 00:19:18,068
They are also against the Japan-Korea talks

291
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:19,685
You want me to be spy?

292
00:19:20,428 --> 00:19:24,560
Not a spy but Freedom warrior.
Fight totalitarianism

293
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,646
Who are you?

294
00:19:29,068 --> 00:19:32,310
I am on South Korean side.
I am your friend

295
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:33,662
Please trust us

296
00:19:33,687 --> 00:19:34,279
But

297
00:19:34,304 --> 00:19:38,576
Don't complain.
We helped you when you were in the camps.

298
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:39,646
So what do you think?

299
00:19:40,787 --> 00:19:41,592
Ok?

300
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:42,974
I refuse

301
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:45,709
You are a patriot of the Republic of Korea

302
00:19:47,357 --> 00:19:49,045
You are against communism,right?

303
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:49,943
Of course?

304
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:54,146
Home country is one.
I can't betray my country

305
00:19:54,771 --> 00:19:56,513
I love the whole Korean mass

306
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,287
Oh my god

307
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:02,928
It can't helped we send you back to Korea if you refuse it

308
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:03,724
Do you threaten?

309
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:07,201
We gave you two choices

310
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,193
You cooperate with us or You will either be deported to Korea and sentenced to death.

311
00:20:11,357 --> 00:20:12,631
Damn it!
You deceived me

312
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:13,709
Don't be mad

313
00:20:13,834 --> 00:20:15,256
I should be sentenced to death

314
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,709
Anyway listen to me

315
00:20:18,021 --> 00:20:20,959
We will give you many rewards if you cooperate with us.

316
00:20:21,404 --> 00:20:24,271
Japanese police will not chase you if we guarantee

317
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:26,763
You can live as much as you like in Japan

318
00:20:27,162 --> 00:20:30,451
You can marry a young Japanese woman

319
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,865
That makes you happier

320
00:20:33,178 --> 00:20:33,795
You think so?

321
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,920
What do you throw away instead of that happiness

322
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,857
Your hysterical nationalist parents?

323
00:20:40,092 --> 00:20:41,568
There are only things that don't rot

324
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,662
At least it's not life-threatening.

325
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,115
Can you think again

326
00:20:47,256 --> 00:20:47,849
I refuse

327
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,068
You don't have to die because you're still young

328
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:51,740
Damn it!

329
00:20:53,092 --> 00:20:53,615
Hey

330
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:57,896
Do you want to offend me

331
00:20:58,365 --> 00:20:59,006
Fuck you

332
00:21:17,553 --> 00:21:18,834
There's nothing you can do.

333
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:21,170
You're just gonna get hurt.

334
00:21:21,436 --> 00:21:23,701
Wipe your nose, it's bleeding.

335
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,756
I'll give you time so think again

336
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,069
There is no need

337
00:21:30,053 --> 00:21:32,991
I admire your conviction,Mr.Lee

338
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:36,686
Please enjoy your meal while listening to the
music

339
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:42,295
Put the music on.

340
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,397
You told me I am like a dog, but not it's your
turn

341
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,912
I never lose

342
00:22:33,334 --> 00:22:34,170
Hey Sally?

343
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:44,170
The visit of the Korean Foreign Minister to Japan
is on schedule, so our plans are also on schedule.

344
00:22:44,686 --> 00:22:45,287
OK?

345
00:22:45,553 --> 00:22:46,381
I get it

346
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,569
You'll get hurt later.

347
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,256
I still smell like sea

348
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:36,389
smell like sea?

349
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:48,889
A sea

350
00:23:49,787 --> 00:23:51,959
Cold and rough sea

351
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:55,553
I was about to go to Singapore at that time

352
00:23:56,748 --> 00:24:00,491
I was a plotter in the Army.
I was removed from the family register.

353
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,170
I was an imaginary person named Yuichi Fukushima.

354
00:24:03,803 --> 00:24:06,873
To find out about the local anti-Japanese overseas Chinese and their backgrounds.

355
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:12,358
It was The end of December in 1944.

356
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:16,811
The ship was sunk shortly after leaving Keelung.

357
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:20,498
Don't do it

358
00:24:22,162 --> 00:24:22,670
I'll go home

359
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:24,170
Wait

360
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,491
I have something serious to say.

361
00:24:27,678 --> 00:24:29,506
I have no time, say it

362
00:24:31,608 --> 00:24:33,045
You were too heavy

363
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:34,467
Sorry for that

364
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,826
Is that your serious saying?

365
00:24:36,873 --> 00:24:38,342
You are tired

366
00:24:38,701 --> 00:24:40,553
Or you think of another things

367
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,584
What the hell?

368
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,420
It's not your business

369
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:45,811
Hey, can you stop over tonight?

370
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:47,897
I'll stop over whenever I like

371
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:53,936
Please listen to me

372
00:24:55,553 --> 00:24:56,686
Please

373
00:24:58,162 --> 00:24:59,420
I don't like it

374
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:03,022
Can I have your baby?

375
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:06,084
What?

376
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:10,991
I want our baby

377
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:13,561
Your baby

378
00:25:15,709 --> 00:25:16,928
What the hell

379
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:21,123
Don't act like stupid

380
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,717
I don't want baby

381
00:25:25,655 --> 00:25:27,545
You don't have to be father

382
00:25:27,787 --> 00:25:29,811
You just allow me to birth him/her

383
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:31,326
I won't allow

384
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:36,655
What if I did it on my own?

385
00:25:37,866 --> 00:25:38,858
I dump you

386
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:45,076
I might kill you

387
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,444
to me?

388
00:25:47,709 --> 00:25:50,107
I know you can't kill me

389
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:53,358
You will ask me to commit suicide

390
00:25:53,506 --> 00:25:56,209
It might be so

391
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,608
You have become to hate me

392
00:25:59,803 --> 00:26:01,444
When I said I love you?

393
00:26:02,147 --> 00:26:02,912
That's not fair

394
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,006
I hate women who are pregnant.

395
00:26:06,678 --> 00:26:07,530
You are cold

396
00:26:11,256 --> 00:26:12,225
You are lair

397
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:13,998
I'm not

398
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,405
I don't tell a lie much

399
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,131
You are mean

400
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:27,311
I sometime think so

401
00:26:32,522 --> 00:26:35,405
Who are you on the earth?

402
00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:38,084
I am my shadow in front of you

403
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,287
I'm the lightest shadow.

404
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:47,686
Get an abortion now.

405
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,561
If you give birth, I will want to kill that
baby.

406
00:26:53,936 --> 00:26:55,069
The baby looks like me

407
00:27:01,194 --> 00:27:02,694
Japan is sex haven

408
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,241
American troops are coming by plane for that

409
00:27:07,772 --> 00:27:09,350
Because there is no god here

410
00:28:15,764 --> 00:28:16,569
Do it right away

411
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:40,412
There's been another strange incident.

412
00:29:02,006 --> 00:29:03,483
Give me money!

413
00:29:03,897 --> 00:29:05,756
Get out of here!

414
00:29:06,147 --> 00:29:10,311
There was a demonstration against the
visit of the Korean Foreign Minister to Japan.

415
00:29:10,741 --> 00:29:13,452
If they participate in this, they will be paid a per
Diem.

416
00:29:13,477 --> 00:29:15,530
A vagrant was hired.

417
00:29:16,741 --> 00:29:19,553
They used the name of a North Korean organization in
Japan.

418
00:29:20,014 --> 00:29:22,295
People of North Korean descent in Japan are
vicious.

419
00:29:22,772 --> 00:29:24,225
This was a clear provocation.

420
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:29,404
I hear this was a plan to suppress the North Korean community in
Japan.

421
00:29:30,592 --> 00:29:31,959
I think so

422
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:37,498
I wonder if this is a plan of South Korean descent in
Japan.

423
00:29:38,803 --> 00:29:43,553
But It was the Japanese who were promoting it.

424
00:29:43,998 --> 00:29:45,944
Not a vagrant in Sanya, of course.

425
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:48,670
They are not right-wing partner neither

426
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:50,397
I get it

427
00:29:51,131 --> 00:29:52,217
Please send us again

428
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:53,108
Hey!

429
00:29:53,514 --> 00:29:55,334
There is a big new from Kyoto

430
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:59,569
They are advertising to kill Koreans who oppose the Japan-Korea
talks.

431
00:30:00,912 --> 00:30:03,670
They says this propaganda is a hoax on the part of the North
Koreans.

432
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,100
This is too good timing

433
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:09,327
Visit of Korean Foreign Minister to Japan for Japan-Korea
Talks

434
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:10,709
Sanya, Kyoto

435
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,162
This is too good timing

436
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:15,756
This is the work of a third-party conspiracy.

437
00:30:16,092 --> 00:30:18,108
This is the work of a spy?

438
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:22,334
The Security Treaty employment contract includes a spy employment
contract.

439
00:30:24,295 --> 00:30:30,952
Japanese educated in espionage are protected as intelligence
agents from being followed, investigated, and arrested.

440
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:34,405
It's stipulated that they can't be caught red-handed and
investigated.

441
00:30:35,107 --> 00:30:38,404
We can't be sure what the spies are doing.

442
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,077
We can

443
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:42,709
Uzaki who is the Omura Camp Escape Case

444
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,991
If we can track down that fake cop.

445
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:48,662
Let me take another look at the Omura case.

446
00:30:48,687 --> 00:30:49,319
It's not good

447
00:30:51,162 --> 00:30:53,795
Gon-Chan, let's have a drink tonight

448
00:30:54,694 --> 00:30:56,912
I have to see my wife tonight

449
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:01,014
You came here early tonight

450
00:31:02,553 --> 00:31:04,702
Because I am lonely

451
00:31:04,727 --> 00:31:06,217
Everyone looks lonely too

452
00:31:06,756 --> 00:31:08,155
We're in a serious recession.

453
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,881
Hi,Madam, you are lovely as usual

454
00:31:11,091 --> 00:31:12,576
You will charge me?

455
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:15,045
The economy is bad this year.

456
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:17,170
I agree with your philosophy.

457
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,655
My philosophy?

458
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,139
Something like 1 + 1 = not necessarily 2...

459
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,108
Oh that's it

460
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,577
You are my no.1 student

461
00:31:26,483 --> 00:31:28,233
Let's drink together!

462
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,194
Welcome

463
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:36,670
She is fine

464
00:31:37,944 --> 00:31:39,123
Give me another glass

465
00:31:41,787 --> 00:31:43,827
You can't go home if you drink too much

466
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,162
I don't mind

467
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:49,170
I will be with you tonight

468
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:52,069
With me?

469
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,209
Yes, I found nice Sushi restaurant

470
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,865
We can have sushi and drink there and then....

471
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,006
That's all

472
00:32:02,709 --> 00:32:03,366
OK?

473
00:32:05,608 --> 00:32:06,514
It can't helped

474
00:32:06,827 --> 00:32:08,584
Then I will send you home

475
00:32:09,373 --> 00:32:10,006
How is it?

476
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:10,780
Sounds good

477
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,070
Welcome

478
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,703
Give me Tennessee

479
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,172
Thanks for coming

480
00:32:30,367 --> 00:32:31,156
Tennessee

481
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,625
I haven't got another glass

482
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,555
I'm sorry

483
00:32:57,773 --> 00:33:00,125
Why you work here without asking me?

484
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:03,000
I want to think while working

485
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,398
Think what?

486
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:07,484
Think what?

487
00:33:11,391 --> 00:33:13,375
You've given up that stupid idea, haven't you?

488
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:23,266
I'll never see you unless you give up the idea

489
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:25,906
I get it

490
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:29,248
Please listen to me after work

491
00:33:29,881 --> 00:33:32,522
I'm done talking about it.

492
00:33:32,639 --> 00:33:35,115
Can we go home together tonight?

493
00:33:35,717 --> 00:33:37,803
I would never sleep with a pregnant woman.

494
00:33:39,092 --> 00:33:40,233
You are mean

495
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,858
I'll come here again

496
00:33:47,702 --> 00:33:48,498
Excuse me

497
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:50,147
Are you Imura?

498
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,944
You are still boy

499
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:56,748
I found out you as soon as I enter

500
00:33:57,264 --> 00:34:00,014
It's been a long time to see you

501
00:34:00,475 --> 00:34:02,975
I heard you got into military school.

502
00:34:03,186 --> 00:34:03,842
What do you do now?

503
00:34:04,647 --> 00:34:05,873
I work a reporter

504
00:34:06,006 --> 00:34:06,944
I know

505
00:34:07,592 --> 00:34:09,178
Then you should come to see me

506
00:34:09,436 --> 00:34:10,584
I don't need to see you

507
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:12,053
You are too bad

508
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,530
Let's have drink tonight

509
00:34:13,702 --> 00:34:14,264
OK?

510
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:18,475
Give us Tennessee

511
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:19,670
Yes

512
00:34:22,264 --> 00:34:23,420
Do you come here often?

513
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:24,678
Yes I am regular customer

514
00:34:24,936 --> 00:34:28,819
I can pay by check and choose the girl I want.

515
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:30,506
Do you know each other?

516
00:34:30,788 --> 00:34:32,170
He is one of the bad friends

517
00:34:32,233 --> 00:34:34,702
Don't say that.
It's been a long time to see you

518
00:34:34,897 --> 00:34:37,389
He and I grew up together and used to hang out a lot.

519
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:39,584
I don't think we were good friend

520
00:34:39,686 --> 00:34:40,991
I just did your opponent

521
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:43,600
Whatever. anyway let's have a toast

522
00:34:47,327 --> 00:34:50,483
He's had this attitude since he was a child.

523
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:57,459
He was so poor and he was upset with it

524
00:34:58,436 --> 00:35:01,202
Even to me, his closest friend, he didn't show his deepest feelings.

525
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,600
It's because My house may have been rich and happy

526
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,811
You asked me what do I do

527
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,834
I am Intelligence

528
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:16,545
It's high-level

529
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:19,467
I see

530
00:35:25,116 --> 00:35:27,045
I have important information now

531
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:30,514
This will be a great article

532
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:33,233
Do you want it?

533
00:35:33,959 --> 00:35:35,178
What kind of information is it?

534
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:38,280
Information about the Northeast Asian Military Alliance

535
00:35:40,178 --> 00:35:40,803
What?

536
00:35:43,311 --> 00:35:44,811
I want it

537
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:47,733
How much?

538
00:35:48,748 --> 00:35:49,740
I don't want money

539
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:50,694
You don't want?

540
00:35:51,288 --> 00:35:53,295
But I want information on the left wing from your company

541
00:35:54,264 --> 00:35:58,366
This is a dark deal between you and me

542
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:00,538
I don't need any other words

543
00:36:01,444 --> 00:36:05,811
Or we maybe fired

544
00:36:06,858 --> 00:36:09,756
He is doing something dangerous

545
00:36:11,084 --> 00:36:15,975
He is spy, yes he looks like spy

546
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,819
It's as if we're both spies.

547
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,928
Well....It's human nature

548
00:36:24,123 --> 00:36:25,944
It's a kind of human desire.

549
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,592
Well..I can't

550
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:31,788
You can't?

551
00:36:31,881 --> 00:36:32,413
Yeah

552
00:36:33,748 --> 00:36:37,154
Can't you give out information on the left wing?

553
00:36:37,725 --> 00:36:39,053
Kind of

554
00:36:40,108 --> 00:36:41,600
Then I'll give you this woman.

555
00:36:42,694 --> 00:36:45,022
She is pregnant with my baby

556
00:36:45,756 --> 00:36:48,155
But I will dispose of it in the near future

557
00:36:50,186 --> 00:36:51,952
I'll give you this woman so please give me that information

558
00:36:54,428 --> 00:36:55,709
What the hell you are

559
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,045
This is a business

560
00:36:59,366 --> 00:37:04,475
And I think you are into her

561
00:37:05,436 --> 00:37:07,616
Shame on you!

562
00:37:09,538 --> 00:37:12,186
What's wrong, Sugawa-san.
Don't be upset

563
00:37:12,584 --> 00:37:13,811
Please introduce me

564
00:37:13,959 --> 00:37:17,014
I'm leaving now.
I will call you later

565
00:37:17,983 --> 00:37:18,983
So think about it

566
00:37:20,139 --> 00:37:20,655
No...

567
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,498
You should think about it

568
00:37:25,116 --> 00:37:27,905
You'll get greedy.

569
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:34,741
How bad he is

570
00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:39,264
What's wrong with her?

571
00:37:41,506 --> 00:37:45,288
That man forgot the cigarette case

572
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,717
Let's go for drive

573
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:31,248
Thank you

574
00:38:32,975 --> 00:38:35,030
You hoped to go with them,right?

575
00:38:37,131 --> 00:38:38,694
I just wanted to get in the way

576
00:38:41,139 --> 00:38:42,288
Did you disappoint?

577
00:38:43,647 --> 00:38:44,491
You are mean

578
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,842
I see, then good bye

579
00:38:52,405 --> 00:38:53,866
Wait wait!

580
00:38:54,772 --> 00:38:56,139
Do you want to play with me tonight?

581
00:38:56,756 --> 00:38:57,654
Forget it

582
00:38:58,592 --> 00:39:01,241
You don't like me so much?

583
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,022
You are stupid

584
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:10,248
You smell good

585
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:14,459
Your smell stimulates me like the sea

586
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,998
Are you a sailor?

587
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,288
I'm unemployed person

588
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:26,514
Here is your dish

589
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:29,748
I still don't understand why I felt that way

590
00:39:30,616 --> 00:39:33,467
I seem to have been drawn to a strong force

591
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:36,061
And it's been that way ever since.

592
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,889
What kind of life does he have?

593
00:39:39,897 --> 00:39:41,920
He's unemployed but rich

594
00:39:42,022 --> 00:39:44,405
I've been dating for 2 years but I don't know

595
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,506
He doesn't say anything about the past or the present

596
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:50,522
He won't even tell me where he lives.

597
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:54,405
Well..how do you contact him?

598
00:39:55,725 --> 00:39:58,272
I just wait he comes

599
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,678
That's sad

600
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:02,733
Drink it

601
00:40:04,483 --> 00:40:05,147
Here is your dish

602
00:40:05,373 --> 00:40:07,295
I'm surprised you're okay with that.

603
00:40:07,514 --> 00:40:09,623
I'm not Okay.
I worry always

604
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:11,545
I am very anxious

605
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:15,225
He always has a pistol

606
00:40:16,264 --> 00:40:18,452
Isn't he killing someone?

607
00:40:18,538 --> 00:40:19,483
I have a feeling so

608
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:21,967
You think too much but....

609
00:40:23,561 --> 00:40:25,717
You had better break up with him

610
00:40:25,951 --> 00:40:26,529
Why?

611
00:40:26,733 --> 00:40:30,241
Because it only makes you miserable

612
00:40:31,709 --> 00:40:33,225
But I can't

613
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,045
It was like the wind was blowing in my head

614
00:40:45,913 --> 00:40:47,772
I felt like I was looking into a deep edge

615
00:40:49,491 --> 00:40:52,920
A spy is working in this midnight Tokyo

616
00:40:53,741 --> 00:40:59,147
Day and night, its spies stir the fires of war.

617
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:11,139
This dog is very healthy.

618
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:16,764
Just keeping this dog will use my monthly salary

619
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,139
Don't be afraid

620
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,116
He's scary on the outside, but kind on the inside.

621
00:41:26,038 --> 00:41:26,795
Just like me

622
00:41:29,436 --> 00:41:32,670
I heard you have many friends in Korea

623
00:41:33,248 --> 00:41:36,116
I have an old student there

624
00:41:36,436 --> 00:41:41,530
and An acquaintance of the Korean Army's staff era is now a bureaucrat

625
00:41:42,163 --> 00:41:46,538
It seems that you cooperated with the formation of the South Korean economic inspection team this time.

626
00:41:47,194 --> 00:41:48,772
Do you also do business in Korea?

627
00:41:50,397 --> 00:41:52,522
I'm too old for it

628
00:41:53,897 --> 00:41:56,686
I was just asked by the government and the business world

629
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:03,561
Strengthening South Korea's economy can counter communism

630
00:42:04,342 --> 00:42:06,741
This is the mission of Japan and the United States

631
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:09,350
You were at During the Pacific War..

632
00:42:09,498 --> 00:42:11,506
It's not the Pacific War but Greater East Asia War

633
00:42:12,131 --> 00:42:15,061
You have opposed the US military

634
00:42:15,459 --> 00:42:19,655
So do you misunderstand me?

635
00:42:20,358 --> 00:42:22,272
My belief is just one

636
00:42:22,952 --> 00:42:27,506
I fight the enemy thoroughly and trust my allies

637
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:33,038
You know what,America used to be our greatest enemy, but now it's our greatest ally.

638
00:42:36,959 --> 00:42:37,725
By the way

639
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:40,991
Asian Youth Comrade Association you are teaching

640
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:45,561
It is rumored that he has been distributing leaflets against the Japan-Korea talks in Yamaya.

641
00:42:46,186 --> 00:42:46,873
Shout up!

642
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:49,342
Will the Chuo Shimbun publish such a lie article?

643
00:42:50,295 --> 00:42:53,045
I just want to confirm the facts

644
00:42:53,663 --> 00:42:54,303
Shout up!

645
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:58,428
It's easy to see if the truth is true

646
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:03,803
Youth Comrade Association cannot oppose the Japan-Korea talks

647
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,858
Why Big Newspapers Hire Reporters Like You

648
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:09,913
I'm sorry

649
00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:13,506
Are you a visitor?

650
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:18,498
He is a reporter for the central newspaper

651
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,530
There is nothing I can talk about

652
00:43:24,373 --> 00:43:26,241
Can I ask you one more?

653
00:43:27,123 --> 00:43:30,178
Uzaki and Imura comes here?

654
00:43:30,576 --> 00:43:31,326
I don't know

655
00:43:34,248 --> 00:43:38,998
I don't know because various people come here.

656
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,834
I don't know Uzaki and Imura

657
00:43:42,256 --> 00:43:44,100
I see, thank you very much

658
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:49,952
What can I do for you?

659
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:51,889
The boss is waiting at gold club

660
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:56,288
I'm not good at golf.
Is it an urgent matter?

661
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:59,811
As you know, the situation in Vietnam is not good.

662
00:43:59,842 --> 00:44:02,670
Anti-American momentum increases and China becomes more and more advantageous

663
00:44:03,506 --> 00:44:06,827
So we need some new ideas to promote Korean morale

664
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:08,241
We want to talk about that

665
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,225
The reporter mentioned earlier linked the case of Sanya with the Asian Youth Comrade Association.

666
00:44:32,287 --> 00:44:33,232
That will be no problem

667
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:37,975
Uzaki and Imura are your people, right?

668
00:44:38,686 --> 00:44:40,444
I don't know them

669
00:44:57,913 --> 00:44:59,608
Please stop the music

670
00:45:01,897 --> 00:45:04,264
Do you cooperate with us?

671
00:45:05,248 --> 00:45:05,983
Yes

672
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:09,022
Please stop the music

673
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,608
Good,you cooperate with us

674
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:20,686
Please stop the music

675
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,452
Stop the music

676
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:32,295
You're a pain in the ass.

677
00:45:41,131 --> 00:45:42,217
Why are you crying?

678
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,983
Wash your face

679
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,631
Mr.Lee,
Your life will change from today

680
00:46:04,358 --> 00:46:08,022
Listen,
You will be an excellent member of North Korean descent in Japan

681
00:46:08,647 --> 00:46:11,452
You will earn their trust and eventually become an executive.

682
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:13,233
This is interesting business

683
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:17,452
Change your cloth,
Let's go

684
00:46:20,491 --> 00:46:21,467
Where are we going?

685
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:26,827
He is a board member of the Chamber of Commerce and is a new North Korean sect.

686
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:29,069
You will be his friend

687
00:46:30,545 --> 00:46:31,545
I owe you this

688
00:46:32,561 --> 00:46:35,897
After escaping from Omura camp, say that you earned from a day labor job

689
00:46:51,123 --> 00:46:51,967
Uzaki-san

690
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:56,084
Tell me what you are.

691
00:46:57,061 --> 00:46:58,850
You just have to work according to my instructions

692
00:46:59,702 --> 00:47:01,538
You don't need to know anything else

693
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:12,186
I was arrested as a spy for the Japanese army when they lost the war.

694
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,467
But I was hired by the American CIC without any punishment

695
00:47:18,225 --> 00:47:23,467
I didn't care.
It was like a new master came

696
00:47:24,545 --> 00:47:27,444
I had a fake name, a fake adviser.

697
00:47:28,678 --> 00:47:32,092
It was very suitable for me

698
00:47:32,772 --> 00:47:35,334
My destiny is very stupid

699
00:47:36,014 --> 00:47:37,506
Please laugh out loud

700
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:47,803
That restaurant.
The man is sitting at the cash register

701
00:47:47,828 --> 00:47:51,108
I'm coming with this car so wait for the timing

702
00:47:52,483 --> 00:47:52,991
OK

703
00:48:07,858 --> 00:48:08,975
Welcome

704
00:48:11,077 --> 00:48:12,311
Beer!

705
00:48:19,873 --> 00:48:21,037
Come here

706
00:48:22,702 --> 00:48:23,733
Would you like beers?

707
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,030
Turn yourself in to the police.

708
00:48:31,725 --> 00:48:36,873
And hope to be repatriated to North Korea.

709
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:42,834
Maybe the Japanese government will send you back to North Korea

710
00:48:44,116 --> 00:48:49,717
I'm sure the North Koreans will warmly welcome you

711
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,014
Mr.Kim, I'll tell the truth

712
00:48:54,123 --> 00:48:57,998
I'm being monitored by a spy agency

713
00:48:58,584 --> 00:49:03,608
I came here at their command

714
00:49:06,428 --> 00:49:07,162
I see

715
00:49:07,373 --> 00:49:08,350
One kalbi.

716
00:49:08,959 --> 00:49:11,678
Please help me

717
00:49:12,998 --> 00:49:15,030
Please calm down

718
00:49:15,584 --> 00:49:17,819
The enemy may be pretending to be a guest

719
00:49:18,405 --> 00:49:19,545
Trust me

720
00:49:20,217 --> 00:49:22,170
I can't betray my country

721
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,280
There is only one motherland.

722
00:49:27,241 --> 00:49:30,787
I have fought for North-South unification

723
00:49:31,584 --> 00:49:34,295
I'm not willing to give up that belief.

724
00:49:35,194 --> 00:49:36,577
I don't betray my country

725
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:38,944
Two Dishes please

726
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:41,241
His dish is ready

727
00:49:41,506 --> 00:49:42,287
I get it

728
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,592
I'll be killed

729
00:49:47,553 --> 00:49:48,194
ok

730
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:52,647
Pretend you're in on it.

731
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,405
I'm told to contact them tomorrow

732
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:56,678
Tomorrow

733
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:02,319
Get back

734
00:50:17,631 --> 00:50:19,842
Take this and go to the Osaka branch

735
00:50:20,381 --> 00:50:22,647
There is a person named Sai

736
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:24,123
You tell the truth to him

737
00:50:25,709 --> 00:50:26,592
Here is money

738
00:50:26,694 --> 00:50:29,420
They may be watching outside.

739
00:50:29,662 --> 00:50:31,748
Get out of the second floor

740
00:50:32,178 --> 00:50:35,327
You can go out to the railroad track from there

741
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,506
It's safe to go over there

742
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:39,412
You can pick up a car there

743
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,241
I'll never forget what you did for me.

744
00:50:42,569 --> 00:50:43,303
Take care

745
00:51:32,561 --> 00:51:33,717
Help me!

746
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:35,327
They are murder!

747
00:52:22,452 --> 00:52:24,233
What the hell?

748
00:52:24,498 --> 00:52:25,975
I did what you ordered

749
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:27,342
You bullshit!

750
00:52:31,881 --> 00:52:34,069
I've bugged everything.

751
00:52:58,858 --> 00:53:00,271
Hi,please wait

752
00:53:07,209 --> 00:53:09,100
Oh Sugawa-san

753
00:53:09,592 --> 00:53:10,577
Were you waiting for Imura?

754
00:53:11,131 --> 00:53:13,498
Please come in

755
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:16,334
Are you sick?

756
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:17,530
I'm Ok

757
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:19,444
You are absent from the bar

758
00:53:19,998 --> 00:53:20,998
How is Imura?

759
00:53:21,428 --> 00:53:22,506
He has not come here since then

760
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:23,537
Never?

761
00:53:24,412 --> 00:53:25,514
Do you want a cup of tea?

762
00:53:25,717 --> 00:53:29,631
Black tea or coffee or whiskey?

763
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:32,139
I knew you were going to have a baby.

764
00:53:38,514 --> 00:53:39,834
I'm against it.

765
00:53:41,139 --> 00:53:42,506
I know it's not my business

766
00:53:45,194 --> 00:53:47,217
He needs me

767
00:53:49,295 --> 00:53:51,037
Even if we can't live together

768
00:53:54,225 --> 00:54:00,139
He was so poor as a child that he developed that
personality.

769
00:54:02,592 --> 00:54:03,983
I'm his classmate so I understand how he feels

770
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:09,256
He was more capable, more human, than I was.

771
00:54:11,897 --> 00:54:13,608
You are very kind

772
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,396
Bring him back to his old self.

773
00:54:20,905 --> 00:54:21,733
I can't

774
00:54:22,623 --> 00:54:23,811
I don't have that kind of power.

775
00:54:25,733 --> 00:54:30,608
I can almost always tell what he does for a
living.

776
00:54:32,452 --> 00:54:33,303
What?

777
00:54:34,436 --> 00:54:35,217
He is a spy

778
00:54:36,444 --> 00:54:38,287
He's part of a larger spy ring.

779
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:43,483
He's doing something very scary.

780
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:48,943
I feel scary, What should I do then?

781
00:54:52,498 --> 00:54:54,600
You should run away

782
00:54:56,217 --> 00:54:56,991
From him?

783
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:59,967
Yes, run away right now

784
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:03,194
Even if you can't break up with him

785
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:05,998
You should run away

786
00:55:07,491 --> 00:55:08,733
I will help you

787
00:55:09,959 --> 00:55:11,108
Sugawa-san

788
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:13,506
Don't laugh

789
00:55:14,748 --> 00:55:19,256
I really love you

790
00:55:26,045 --> 00:55:27,702
You should have locked the door

791
00:55:28,678 --> 00:55:30,061
I was going to see you

792
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,498
Don't tell a lie

793
00:55:31,694 --> 00:55:32,577
Trust me

794
00:55:33,264 --> 00:55:35,561
I've been looking for you about that deal.

795
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:37,733
You haven't had an abortion yet?

796
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:40,748
I hate women who get pregnant.

797
00:55:40,873 --> 00:55:42,983
You shouldn't say it in front of him

798
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:46,881
I think you're jealous of me.

799
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:50,569
What? What did you say?

800
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:52,436
I quit the deal

801
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:54,756
You were the first to say it.

802
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:58,889
A deal can only be made with even strength.

803
00:55:59,412 --> 00:56:03,108
You and me, it's just my loss.

804
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:06,741
I don't need you anymore.
Go home right away

805
00:56:12,366 --> 00:56:14,756
You are not the only informant.

806
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:17,366
Wait!

807
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:21,686
What do you mean by that?

808
00:56:23,912 --> 00:56:29,780
I'm an employee of a large newspaper
company. I know a lot of secret information.

809
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:35,584
And I know you are related with Sanya and Kyoto
case

810
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:36,412
What?

811
00:56:40,780 --> 00:56:42,748
He was definitely upset.

812
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:46,217
I'm fine with small deals.

813
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:49,006
I will withhold any information that could be used against
you.

814
00:56:49,327 --> 00:56:52,811
in exchange for it, I want to know about the Uzaki

815
00:56:53,866 --> 00:56:57,631
I don't know how much he know.

816
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,498
I don't know such a person

817
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:03,772
He's the fake police captain in the Omura prison camp escape
case.

818
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,061
You know him,right?

819
00:57:05,194 --> 00:57:05,912
Go home!

820
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:09,061
Get in touch with me later

821
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:16,545
What's wrong?

822
00:58:05,295 --> 00:58:06,944
Your belly is too big.

823
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,608
I give you this

824
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:21,147
Kill yourself using it

825
00:58:24,295 --> 00:58:26,998
I don't want.
Why you don't kill me?

826
00:58:28,897 --> 00:58:32,881
Shoot me! Shoot me!  It's better if you kill me!

827
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:38,366
You're interfering with my work.

828
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,185
(In the Osaka Branch of the Korean Association of
Japan)

829
00:58:55,897 --> 00:58:57,131
You are Mr.Lee

830
00:58:57,311 --> 00:58:57,873
Yes

831
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,311
This letter says you'll explain it to me.

832
00:59:06,162 --> 00:59:09,225
So please tell me

833
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:10,475
Yes

834
00:59:12,655 --> 00:59:16,896
I was a student at Seoul National University,
and I led the June 3rd demonstration.

835
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:19,514
What you will do to me?

836
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:22,421
We don't need two Lee Kishuns

837
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:24,397
We will change your face

838
00:59:25,389 --> 00:59:27,749
In short,You are not Li from now on.

839
00:59:27,952 --> 00:59:28,991
I don't like it!

840
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:31,177
I don't like it!

841
00:59:31,968 --> 00:59:32,647
No!

842
00:59:33,913 --> 00:59:34,913
No!

843
00:59:35,983 --> 00:59:36,983
No!

844
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,382
Whose face do you want him to be?

845
01:00:06,718 --> 01:00:08,897
Hey,Whose face do you want him to be?

846
01:00:10,616 --> 01:00:15,077
Make him look nothing like him.

847
01:00:41,249 --> 01:00:43,374
Keiichi Taguchi, Night High School Student

848
01:00:44,249 --> 01:00:48,671
If your senses are correct, the case will be
solved.

849
01:00:49,225 --> 01:00:50,858
Oh stop here please

850
01:00:56,897 --> 01:00:57,874
Thanks for today

851
01:00:57,968 --> 01:01:01,225
I'm always happy to help, if that's okay with
you.

852
01:01:01,343 --> 01:01:01,843
Thanks

853
01:01:07,639 --> 01:01:10,632
I was on this road that night, as usual.

854
01:01:11,217 --> 01:01:15,076
It was around 10:30, because I didn't want to
make any stops on my way home from school.

855
01:01:15,249 --> 01:01:15,905
10:30

856
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:16,944
Here it is

857
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:19,686
I heard screams in here.

858
01:01:21,405 --> 01:01:22,882
I hided here

859
01:01:23,827 --> 01:01:25,358
He said someone kills him?

860
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:26,741
Yes

861
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:29,046
He was like help me! I will be killed!

862
01:01:32,827 --> 01:01:34,553
Why you didn't report to police?

863
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:36,272
I was going to

864
01:01:37,124 --> 01:01:39,225
But there was nothing in the news paper so

865
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:41,108
But I am curious.

866
01:01:41,133 --> 01:01:41,780
You let us know

867
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:42,288
Yes

868
01:01:42,313 --> 01:01:43,007
Thanks

869
01:01:45,389 --> 01:01:46,483
Was he this man?

870
01:01:54,163 --> 01:01:54,975
Can't you remember?

871
01:01:55,928 --> 01:01:56,921
It's hard to remember

872
01:01:57,428 --> 01:02:01,241
I couldn't see much because the headlights of the car were
backlit.

873
01:02:02,271 --> 01:02:03,021
I see

874
01:02:04,631 --> 01:02:07,334
About the guy you saw in the driving seat

875
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:08,209
Yes

876
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:11,569
Please tell me the man's face in as much detail as possible

877
01:02:13,733 --> 01:02:16,639
I saw the man's face for a moment as he switched back

878
01:02:17,733 --> 01:02:20,678
His face looked a little cold.

879
01:02:21,061 --> 01:02:23,186
Do you know if I show you his picture?

880
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:25,975
Well....maybe

881
01:02:26,975 --> 01:02:29,319
The car was a foreign car?

882
01:02:29,444 --> 01:02:31,787
That's right, it was Chevrolet

883
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,295
I also saw a few car plates.

884
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:38,436
Did the Lee kishun come?

885
01:02:38,655 --> 01:02:42,701
I didn't tell you but he came

886
01:02:44,014 --> 01:02:44,608
Did he come?

887
01:02:45,241 --> 01:02:48,850
But soon I kicked him out.
I didn't want to have a relationship with him

888
01:02:49,209 --> 01:02:51,170
I gave him money and got him out

889
01:02:51,834 --> 01:02:52,678
When was it?

890
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:54,826
It was the day before yesterday

891
01:02:55,405 --> 01:02:56,139
Where he has gone?

892
01:02:56,428 --> 01:02:58,147
Well....I don't know

893
01:02:59,975 --> 01:03:01,162
You are cold

894
01:03:01,756 --> 01:03:04,506
There is no choice.
I have a business here

895
01:03:04,787 --> 01:03:06,756
Let sleeping dogs lie.

896
01:03:07,889 --> 01:03:08,553
Right?

897
01:03:11,694 --> 01:03:12,264
Yes

898
01:03:14,037 --> 01:03:14,748
Did you call me?

899
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:19,803
Where are you going out lately in the afternoon?

900
01:03:22,264 --> 01:03:25,108
I heard you had a crush on a woman in a bar.

901
01:03:27,311 --> 01:03:28,631
I reported to the director

902
01:03:29,983 --> 01:03:32,076
I heard you investigate Lee kishun case

903
01:03:32,209 --> 01:03:35,686
That case is left to the head office

904
01:03:37,991 --> 01:03:41,530
If you can't do this job, please show us why.

905
01:03:42,491 --> 01:03:43,811
For example, there was external pressure

906
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:45,443
Don't exaggerate

907
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:49,639
You're fighting a fantasy that you've created in your head.

908
01:03:50,553 --> 01:03:51,787
I'm not

909
01:03:53,084 --> 01:03:57,881
Unreal things are happening in this Japan

910
01:03:58,905 --> 01:03:59,889
What is that?

911
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:02,225
For example, the abduction case

912
01:04:03,264 --> 01:04:06,998
Such things are done in Japan, a country governed by law.

913
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:08,780
We can't overlook it.

914
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:10,561
Does it have anything to do with Lee kishun?

915
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:12,014
Yes

916
01:04:13,116 --> 01:04:15,897
There are various problems on the surface

917
01:04:16,662 --> 01:04:20,686
But Lee's escape case,A fake detective named Uzaki who helped with him

918
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:23,647
Abduction case using Chevrolet

919
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:28,280
And There is a man involved in the Japan-Korea issue

920
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:31,100
Assumptions are dangerous.

921
01:04:31,459 --> 01:04:32,022
Don't worry

922
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,951
I'll meet that man tonight

923
01:04:35,787 --> 01:04:41,803
I get clues to these cases from the man

924
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:43,537
So let me do this job

925
01:04:45,022 --> 01:04:46,225
It will be solved in a little more

926
01:04:48,592 --> 01:04:49,561
I will work on this

927
01:04:50,991 --> 01:04:53,639
If you don't allow me, I'll move to another company.

928
01:04:54,733 --> 01:04:56,373
Wait. that's risky!

929
01:04:58,756 --> 01:04:59,678
His photo?

930
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:02,576
There's not a single picture of him.

931
01:05:03,428 --> 01:05:03,912
I see

932
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,701
I was angry when I told him to take a picture together

933
01:05:11,264 --> 01:05:12,334
He is weird

934
01:05:14,139 --> 01:05:15,326
Well....

935
01:05:15,866 --> 01:05:17,303
Thank you very much

936
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:19,061
Wait

937
01:05:19,444 --> 01:05:20,803
What's wrong with him?

938
01:05:21,264 --> 01:05:22,709
Will you use his pic?

939
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:23,514
Nothing special

940
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:25,787
Do you want to see him without telling me?

941
01:05:25,812 --> 01:05:26,303
No

942
01:05:27,655 --> 01:05:29,701
Don't do that please

943
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,920
I worry about you

944
01:05:32,014 --> 01:05:35,194
Then will you leave him?

945
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:39,928
Let me think about it

946
01:05:58,678 --> 01:06:00,600
Let's make this deal simple.

947
01:06:01,201 --> 01:06:02,420
You called me

948
01:06:05,584 --> 01:06:06,787
What do you want?

949
01:06:07,178 --> 01:06:11,241
Tell me all the information about our organization that you know

950
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,529
What is the reward?

951
01:06:14,491 --> 01:06:16,139
I don't know Uzaki

952
01:06:19,608 --> 01:06:22,170
Can I meet your boss?

953
01:06:23,529 --> 01:06:24,436
Do you want to meet my boss?

954
01:06:27,897 --> 01:06:28,944
Who is your boss?

955
01:06:30,030 --> 01:06:32,170
He will not be a public security boss or a cabinet politician

956
01:06:33,405 --> 01:06:34,600
Is he CIA?

957
01:06:35,194 --> 01:06:35,826
Or

958
01:06:36,819 --> 01:06:38,092
Is he a more secret espionage person?

959
01:06:38,568 --> 01:06:39,529
What if you meet my boss?

960
01:06:41,022 --> 01:06:42,928
I want to know the purpose of your espionage

961
01:06:43,373 --> 01:06:47,029
I want to know why you can work freely in Japan

962
01:06:47,951 --> 01:06:50,155
I can't accept your offer

963
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,780
I'll buy your information

964
01:06:54,076 --> 01:06:54,920
Give me a break

965
01:06:55,991 --> 01:06:57,280
I am a newspaper reporter

966
01:06:58,194 --> 01:06:59,123
I am a Japanese newspaper reporter

967
01:07:00,780 --> 01:07:04,162
I want readers to know about your espionage

968
01:07:06,076 --> 01:07:07,866
Don't think about buying with money

969
01:07:09,491 --> 01:07:10,639
I don't want to lose

970
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:15,029
How can I trade my life for yours when you won't risk yours?

971
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:17,358
Do you afraid?

972
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:20,389
You are lying

973
01:07:21,123 --> 01:07:21,991
Do you afraid?

974
01:07:22,483 --> 01:07:23,194
You are stupid

975
01:07:24,022 --> 01:07:25,506
You have no courage

976
01:07:26,381 --> 01:07:28,834
You are pretending to be strong

977
01:07:29,553 --> 01:07:33,311
You don't understand how I feel

978
01:07:35,287 --> 01:07:37,905
Do you regret?

979
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:43,186
Are you suffering from what you are doing?

980
01:07:43,522 --> 01:07:44,334
Shout up!

981
01:07:45,717 --> 01:07:46,600
How about our deal?

982
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:49,006
You sell or not

983
01:07:49,694 --> 01:07:50,889
I say this as an old friend.

984
01:07:52,647 --> 01:07:56,834
You will eventually be killed.
This is the fate of espionage

985
01:07:57,889 --> 01:08:00,498
Now is the time for you to quit this job.

986
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:03,506
This is the only way you save your life

987
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:07,326
Wait

988
01:08:09,061 --> 01:08:11,061
Getting out of the organization can be difficult

989
01:08:12,178 --> 01:08:13,764
But the more time that passes, the more difficult it becomes.

990
01:08:15,037 --> 01:08:15,662
Before it's too late

991
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:19,131
This is my destiny I chose.
Don't order me

992
01:08:20,030 --> 01:08:21,342
Do you understand our friendship?

993
01:08:24,662 --> 01:08:25,373
I get it

994
01:08:26,537 --> 01:08:30,186
You wanted to make a deal because of friendship?

995
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:31,631
Don't make me laugh

996
01:08:32,530 --> 01:08:34,561
You are a third-rate newspaper

997
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:37,264
I hate people like you

998
01:08:39,139 --> 01:08:40,084
I never see you

999
01:08:46,147 --> 01:08:46,795
Imura!

1000
01:08:49,303 --> 01:08:50,069
Run away,Gon-Chan

1001
01:10:09,381 --> 01:10:10,209
Dangerous!

1002
01:10:44,522 --> 01:10:45,522
Ok We got it

1003
01:10:49,428 --> 01:10:51,311
Did the ship sink?

1004
01:10:51,858 --> 01:10:53,069
Where did this come from?

1005
01:10:53,444 --> 01:10:54,553
Don't touch it

1006
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,116
You can find out if you look up his belongings

1007
01:10:57,412 --> 01:10:58,381
Ok I'll find out

1008
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:00,873
Is it a beast?

1009
01:11:01,850 --> 01:11:03,233
It is not a beast

1010
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:14,717
What is this?

1011
01:11:16,186 --> 01:11:17,428
This is some code

1012
01:11:18,201 --> 01:11:18,733
What is that?

1013
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:20,334
This is used to break the code

1014
01:11:21,342 --> 01:11:22,428
He is a spy

1015
01:11:24,162 --> 01:11:25,147
What is this?

1016
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:33,819
(Drifting corpse of North Korean agent found)

1017
01:11:39,373 --> 01:11:39,959
Look

1018
01:12:00,975 --> 01:12:01,514
Finished?

1019
01:12:01,998 --> 01:12:02,412
OK

1020
01:12:03,451 --> 01:12:04,459
Thank you for your time

1021
01:12:06,061 --> 01:12:07,858
Has anyone ever performed an autopsy on this person?

1022
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:08,358
Yes

1023
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,420
I want to meet him

1024
01:12:15,084 --> 01:12:17,592
Sasaki doctor,
He is from news paper agent

1025
01:12:21,483 --> 01:12:22,108
Hello

1026
01:12:22,795 --> 01:12:23,662
Sorry to disturb you

1027
01:12:25,061 --> 01:12:25,881
What can I do for you?

1028
01:12:26,241 --> 01:12:27,662
What is the cause of death of that corpse?

1029
01:12:28,998 --> 01:12:31,772
I thought he drowned, but he froze to death.

1030
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:32,623
he froze to death?

1031
01:12:32,803 --> 01:12:33,100
Yes

1032
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:34,694
It's summer now

1033
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,295
It's strange

1034
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,537
His blood distribution was abnormal

1035
01:12:40,271 --> 01:12:43,724
All his organs were growing

1036
01:12:44,241 --> 01:12:46,741
The blood in his heart was higher only to the left

1037
01:12:47,444 --> 01:12:48,850
This is a characteristic of freezing death

1038
01:12:49,655 --> 01:12:50,201
I see

1039
01:12:52,311 --> 01:12:54,686
Do humans change their faces when they die?

1040
01:12:55,670 --> 01:12:58,670
The face changes a little.
Do you have anything to do with that corpse?

1041
01:12:59,803 --> 01:13:02,537
I think he is this guy

1042
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:04,905
So I've come here from Tokyo

1043
01:13:05,623 --> 01:13:07,162
I was disappointed because it was completely different

1044
01:13:08,076 --> 01:13:08,694
Who is he?

1045
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:10,717
A man I look for

1046
01:13:11,631 --> 01:13:12,725
Thank you very much

1047
01:13:12,842 --> 01:13:13,350
Not at all

1048
01:13:18,201 --> 01:13:20,834
Do you have a photo of his death?

1049
01:13:22,522 --> 01:13:23,147
Yes

1050
01:13:23,912 --> 01:13:29,678
His face is not the same person, but we can check his
fingerprints.

1051
01:13:42,155 --> 01:13:45,819
It's the same fingerprint.
He is Lee Kishun for sure

1052
01:13:47,053 --> 01:13:48,615
But why the different faces?

1053
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:52,936
Oh..They changed it

1054
01:13:54,272 --> 01:13:55,436
Welcome

1055
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,311
Lee Kishun was dead

1056
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:11,115
What?

1057
01:14:13,639 --> 01:14:14,998
Is that really?

1058
01:14:16,811 --> 01:14:17,670
Yes

1059
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:23,405
I checked yesterday.

1060
01:14:23,905 --> 01:14:26,022
I can't believe it

1061
01:14:26,490 --> 01:14:27,569
Why?

1062
01:14:28,115 --> 01:14:29,795
Why?
It's impossible

1063
01:14:29,927 --> 01:14:32,826
Look.
He is Lee Kishun

1064
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:38,662
He is not.
He was not in Niigata

1065
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:40,194
You misunderstand it

1066
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:43,006
I checked his fingerprint.

1067
01:14:44,084 --> 01:14:46,498
Are you sure?

1068
01:14:47,686 --> 01:14:51,530
Mr.Kim.
You know something. Please tell me

1069
01:14:53,389 --> 01:14:55,225
Kishun is in Osaka

1070
01:14:55,740 --> 01:14:58,514
He is at his friend's house

1071
01:14:58,967 --> 01:15:01,405
He'll let me know if something happen

1072
01:15:02,561 --> 01:15:04,248
He is not Lee Kishun

1073
01:15:05,811 --> 01:15:07,076
He is a fake

1074
01:15:08,530 --> 01:15:12,444
Mr.Kim.
He was killed

1075
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:14,944
Welcome

1076
01:15:29,264 --> 01:15:33,280
A spy is trying to get into our organization.

1077
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:38,069
The area around the Osaka branch is filled with their hidden cameras.

1078
01:15:38,358 --> 01:15:39,670
I see

1079
01:15:42,194 --> 01:15:47,498
To them, our organization looks like a North Korean guerrilla force.

1080
01:15:47,795 --> 01:15:49,381
It's misunderstanding

1081
01:15:49,498 --> 01:15:54,389
We are only uniting to increase the authority of Koreans in Japan.

1082
01:15:55,631 --> 01:15:58,756
Spies always assume war.

1083
01:15:59,373 --> 01:16:05,396
They are creating public opinion with their
paranoia.

1084
01:16:06,686 --> 01:16:08,944
This is how spy works at present

1085
01:16:41,733 --> 01:16:44,022
He went to Niigta? For what?

1086
01:16:45,037 --> 01:16:47,483
Can we talk it in front of him?

1087
01:16:48,209 --> 01:16:51,256
He knows everything, don't worry

1088
01:16:52,795 --> 01:16:56,639
Spy knew Lee Kishun came to Osaka

1089
01:16:56,834 --> 01:17:01,506
He feels scary so we tried him back to North
Korea

1090
01:17:01,748 --> 01:17:08,115
It is the day the ship is going to sail.
I figured Spy didn't know yet.

1091
01:17:08,631 --> 01:17:11,170
What? it's a problem

1092
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:18,686
They are going to infiltrate the North Koreans with
fakes.

1093
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:09,397
Lee Kishun

1094
01:18:12,115 --> 01:18:14,490
Are you really Lee Kishun?

1095
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:17,162
Of course I am

1096
01:18:18,248 --> 01:18:21,787
Thank you for coming to see me off

1097
01:18:23,045 --> 01:18:26,787
He looks like Lee Kishun but he is not.
His voice is different

1098
01:18:28,686 --> 01:18:29,764
Is he fake?

1099
01:18:31,388 --> 01:18:32,592
Who are you?

1100
01:18:33,084 --> 01:18:34,983
I haven't met you in my life

1101
01:18:38,300 --> 01:18:39,706
He run away!

1102
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:41,574
Catch him!

1103
01:18:44,061 --> 01:18:44,959
Call doctor!

1104
01:19:13,764 --> 01:19:16,178
We killed Lee Kishun's fake

1105
01:19:20,568 --> 01:19:23,045
But It's very costly to our organization.

1106
01:19:23,717 --> 01:19:26,607
It's all your fault

1107
01:19:26,959 --> 01:19:30,318
You stupid.
I was just asked to kill Lee Kishun

1108
01:19:30,826 --> 01:19:32,529
I have nothing to do with his fake

1109
01:19:32,554 --> 01:19:33,350
You think so?

1110
01:19:33,592 --> 01:19:37,068
You failed to break him out of the Omura camp and take him in to KIM.

1111
01:19:37,287 --> 01:19:42,029
You killed Lee Kishun and You've infiltrated Osaka with his fake.

1112
01:19:42,615 --> 01:19:46,779
You think you've succeeded, but someone plucked it out of the air.

1113
01:19:47,709 --> 01:19:48,436
Who is it?

1114
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:51,717
Your best friend, Yasuo Sugawa

1115
01:19:55,506 --> 01:19:56,717
Sugawa....

1116
01:20:02,928 --> 01:20:04,467
Our boss doesn't trust you

1117
01:20:05,404 --> 01:20:11,318
We hired you because we heard you were good at what you do.

1118
01:20:12,068 --> 01:20:14,107
But our boss doubt you

1119
01:20:14,873 --> 01:20:16,654
Let me see boss,Peter

1120
01:20:17,264 --> 01:20:17,873
No

1121
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,428
Please. I want to explain it

1122
01:20:23,850 --> 01:20:27,193
Can you?
I know you often meet with Sugawa lately

1123
01:20:27,521 --> 01:20:29,436
Have you notice us?

1124
01:20:30,307 --> 01:20:31,737
Did you watch me?

1125
01:20:32,643 --> 01:20:33,823
Our boss doesn't trust anyone

1126
01:20:34,369 --> 01:20:36,119
This is the rule of Spy activity

1127
01:20:36,463 --> 01:20:37,666
Our boss is misunderstanding me

1128
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,213
Let me see boss,Peter

1129
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,948
Or At least, you understand me

1130
01:20:47,862 --> 01:20:50,885
I tried to get information on North Korea from
him.

1131
01:20:51,549 --> 01:20:52,799
That's why I see him often

1132
01:20:53,338 --> 01:20:55,479
But on the contrary, he's taken our information.

1133
01:20:56,549 --> 01:20:57,752
He knows everything what we are doing

1134
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:04,252
Please order what I have to do

1135
01:21:06,705 --> 01:21:08,307
You should find the answer on your own

1136
01:21:12,151 --> 01:21:13,299
Do I have to kill Sugawa?

1137
01:21:14,776 --> 01:21:16,846
He's a reporter for a major newspaper.

1138
01:21:17,901 --> 01:21:18,877
I'll manage it anyway

1139
01:21:20,260 --> 01:21:21,151
I'm sure I kill him

1140
01:21:21,176 --> 01:21:25,697
OK, Make sure you succeed.
Otherwise, you will be in danger.

1141
01:21:25,722 --> 01:21:26,252
You understand?

1142
01:21:56,893 --> 01:21:58,565
Is that western house?

1143
01:22:02,494 --> 01:22:05,432
Could you bring him to our company,Mr.Kim?

1144
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,979
It's not safe for two people.

1145
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:12,057
No worry.
I'm just covering them.

1146
01:22:12,082 --> 01:22:13,307
But....

1147
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:15,737
Leave it to us.
We will run away if we are in danger

1148
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:17,041
But....

1149
01:22:17,776 --> 01:22:20,533
It's even more dangerous to wait here.

1150
01:22:46,041 --> 01:22:48,854
Hello? We are from central newspaper

1151
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:52,563
Hello? We are from newspaper

1152
01:22:53,713 --> 01:22:54,315
Strange

1153
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,885
Let's go backdoor

1154
01:23:23,908 --> 01:23:27,150
Hello? We are from central newspaper

1155
01:23:29,096 --> 01:23:29,893
Gon-Chan

1156
01:24:06,862 --> 01:24:10,166
What is this?
This is a lipstick

1157
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,143
This is foreign one

1158
01:24:17,799 --> 01:24:18,432
A woman

1159
01:24:30,385 --> 01:24:31,502
Careful!

1160
01:24:48,966 --> 01:24:50,450
Anyone there

1161
01:24:52,919 --> 01:24:53,356
What should we do?

1162
01:24:55,348 --> 01:24:56,052
Let's go

1163
01:25:03,755 --> 01:25:05,653
Anyone there?

1164
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:09,325
We are from newspaper

1165
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:11,012
Careful!

1166
01:25:11,083 --> 01:25:11,848
I'm Ok

1167
01:25:46,918 --> 01:25:49,582
We almost caught the spy agency.

1168
01:25:50,300 --> 01:25:51,699
They got away just fine.

1169
01:25:51,724 --> 01:25:53,277
Don't let you down

1170
01:25:53,902 --> 01:25:57,214
Our Director's consulting with the Head Director.

1171
01:25:59,441 --> 01:26:01,339
I'm a good photographer.

1172
01:26:02,277 --> 01:26:07,089
Taguchi and the people at the Omura camp confirmed that he was
Imura.

1173
01:26:07,394 --> 01:26:09,285
I see. Spy is like him

1174
01:26:09,418 --> 01:26:10,621
Let me see

1175
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:11,839
He looks good man

1176
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:14,410
Sugawa-kun

1177
01:26:14,785 --> 01:26:15,457
Come here

1178
01:26:20,035 --> 01:26:21,488
Bring charges against Imura.

1179
01:26:21,621 --> 01:26:21,996
What?

1180
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,222
Our Head Director said that

1181
01:26:23,347 --> 01:26:24,082
Our Head Director said that?

1182
01:26:24,121 --> 01:26:27,277
He'd like to help you with your work.

1183
01:26:28,535 --> 01:26:30,511
It's little late...

1184
01:26:31,496 --> 01:26:32,543
Sugawa?

1185
01:26:32,699 --> 01:26:35,191
Wait a min.
Phone call for you

1186
01:26:36,722 --> 01:26:37,222
From your girl

1187
01:26:39,933 --> 01:26:40,871
Hello? This is Sugawa

1188
01:26:41,894 --> 01:26:43,464
Yes, what?

1189
01:26:44,714 --> 01:26:47,605
What happened about Imura?
He never come to see you?

1190
01:26:48,472 --> 01:26:51,347
Yes but he called me just before

1191
01:26:51,613 --> 01:26:54,621
I asked him to come here

1192
01:26:55,019 --> 01:26:57,175
He said he will call me later

1193
01:26:57,863 --> 01:27:01,050
I'm sorry to disturb you

1194
01:27:02,058 --> 01:27:03,589
Hello? Hello?

1195
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:09,254
Please come here right away

1196
01:27:10,324 --> 01:27:13,277
OK, I'll go there right away!

1197
01:27:17,105 --> 01:27:18,902
Imura said he will break up with her

1198
01:27:19,355 --> 01:27:21,433
He is important to us

1199
01:27:22,324 --> 01:27:23,589
And she looks panicking

1200
01:27:24,065 --> 01:27:25,136
I must take care of it

1201
01:27:28,746 --> 01:27:29,918
Hey,wait

1202
01:27:32,277 --> 01:27:34,144
Wait,Sugawa

1203
01:27:34,621 --> 01:27:36,668
I'll go with you.
You are on their target

1204
01:27:37,324 --> 01:27:40,441
No worry.
Let me go alone

1205
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:23,589
What's wrong with you?

1206
01:28:27,277 --> 01:28:28,129
Take your seat

1207
01:28:33,526 --> 01:28:34,237
What you will do to me?

1208
01:28:34,276 --> 01:28:34,761
You

1209
01:28:34,902 --> 01:28:35,839
I'll kill you

1210
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:37,918
Stop doing it!

1211
01:28:38,129 --> 01:28:40,480
You shout, I pull the trigger.

1212
01:28:40,957 --> 01:28:43,191
You said you'll have to talk wit him

1213
01:28:44,050 --> 01:28:46,847
Yes...final talk

1214
01:28:47,558 --> 01:28:49,863
Why? Because we found out your base?

1215
01:28:50,925 --> 01:28:52,472
You know too much of us

1216
01:28:54,074 --> 01:28:55,285
Write a suicide note.

1217
01:28:57,043 --> 01:29:00,582
You commit suicide because you have trouble
working.

1218
01:29:02,754 --> 01:29:04,277
Stop doing it!

1219
01:29:05,879 --> 01:29:06,589
Write it!

1220
01:29:08,871 --> 01:29:11,191
Do you think I follow you?

1221
01:29:11,988 --> 01:29:16,433
If you don't write, I'll kill her too and make it look like a suicide
pact.

1222
01:29:22,245 --> 01:29:24,354
Write it if you want to save her

1223
01:29:26,284 --> 01:29:29,776
Don't worry about me.
I'll be fine

1224
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:33,901
You think you win but you lost

1225
01:29:34,932 --> 01:29:38,901
If you bring her into this, you will suffer for the rest of your
life.

1226
01:29:39,776 --> 01:29:43,722
She is the only woman who love you in the world

1227
01:29:44,690 --> 01:29:45,393
Write it!

1228
01:29:50,925 --> 01:29:51,901
Don't push me

1229
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:57,753
I'm a news paper reporter.
It's my job to write.

1230
01:29:58,878 --> 01:29:59,917
Let me write slowly

1231
01:30:00,589 --> 01:30:01,815
You should give up

1232
01:30:05,761 --> 01:30:09,550
There's only one thing I regret.

1233
01:30:10,909 --> 01:30:11,581
What is it?

1234
01:30:13,651 --> 01:30:20,050
The person I met last will be my best old friend

1235
01:30:21,401 --> 01:30:23,597
But He's totally bad guy

1236
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:28,237
You spies are not brave. you are afraid of the world

1237
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:31,643
You don't have spirits

1238
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:34,565
You can't love anyone

1239
01:30:34,807 --> 01:30:35,628
Even yourself

1240
01:30:37,026 --> 01:30:39,682
The rats are better than you.

1241
01:30:40,823 --> 01:30:42,135
But a rat is not a person.

1242
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:42,784
Shout up

1243
01:30:43,550 --> 01:30:47,682
You don't like to listen?
Has your heart been broken?

1244
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:51,956
You're stalling for time?

1245
01:30:52,768 --> 01:30:55,604
I will wait another 5 mins.
I won't wait anymore

1246
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,104
Some people commit suicide without writing a suicide note.

1247
01:31:13,557 --> 01:31:15,674
Stop it.
Drop the gun.

1248
01:31:15,699 --> 01:31:18,010
Don't do anything stupid.

1249
01:31:19,190 --> 01:31:23,206
This is the gun you have me before for my
suicide

1250
01:31:23,909 --> 01:31:26,245
Don't move.
Otherwise I shoot him

1251
01:31:26,932 --> 01:31:28,135
I'll shoot you if you shoot him

1252
01:31:28,206 --> 01:31:30,495
Don't do overdo ,Shigeko-san

1253
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,901
Never mind.
I will commit suicide after I shoot him

1254
01:31:34,096 --> 01:31:35,174
Wait...

1255
01:31:35,276 --> 01:31:38,252
I've always thought about dying with this gun.

1256
01:31:38,659 --> 01:31:40,870
so I don't care if I die

1257
01:31:41,628 --> 01:31:43,565
I'd be miserable if I lived.

1258
01:31:44,885 --> 01:31:49,596
I'd be happier to die with you.

1259
01:31:55,010 --> 01:31:55,846
Drop the gun

1260
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:08,314
You are fine now. Leave it to me, and you run
away

1261
01:32:08,339 --> 01:32:10,612
You run away, I need to talk with him

1262
01:32:11,424 --> 01:32:12,604
That's not good

1263
01:32:12,629 --> 01:32:13,870
You are going to...

1264
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:15,776
Stop it!

1265
01:32:31,635 --> 01:32:32,487
Shigeko...

1266
01:32:35,495 --> 01:32:36,495
Shigeko-san

1267
01:32:37,432 --> 01:32:38,432
Shigeko-san

1268
01:32:38,799 --> 01:32:39,799
Shigeko-san

1269
01:32:46,721 --> 01:32:49,245
You can no longer return to the spy agency.

1270
01:32:51,088 --> 01:32:55,284
You have no way to live but to return to our
world.

1271
01:32:55,909 --> 01:32:59,253
To live? for what?

1272
01:33:00,518 --> 01:33:02,377
Wait, Imura!

1273
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:11,916
Imura

1274
01:33:14,604 --> 01:33:15,651
Sugawa

1275
01:33:18,620 --> 01:33:21,409
Do you see me, Imura?

1276
01:33:22,424 --> 01:33:25,307
I can smell the sea.

1277
01:33:34,799 --> 01:33:37,448
All has been finished at that time

1278
01:33:39,401 --> 01:33:44,073
All leads to the spy agency are now gone.

1279
01:33:47,034 --> 01:33:48,831
It was a quick end.

1280
01:33:51,065 --> 01:33:53,557
But I'll never give up

1281
01:33:54,346 --> 01:33:56,409
The world is moving more and more violently.

1282
01:33:58,792 --> 01:34:00,034
I'm in hurry

1283
01:34:01,674 --> 01:34:05,018
The united action against the Vietnam War and against the Japan-Korea talks
is

1284
01:34:06,135 --> 01:34:09,628
Organizers announced 65,000 people.

1285
01:34:11,049 --> 01:34:14,760
The atmosphere in the hall is more heightened than
expected.

1286
01:34:15,885 --> 01:34:18,815
The first demonstration team left Hibiya Park at 8:00
a.m.

1287
01:34:19,018 --> 01:34:20,885
Thank you, I'll be there soon

1288
01:34:22,065 --> 01:34:23,963
I'll go the meeting

1289
01:34:24,573 --> 01:34:27,495
Representative Oka's press conference will begin at
9:00.

1290
01:34:28,276 --> 01:34:29,104
Thank you

1291
01:34:29,542 --> 01:34:31,198
You're having a hard time with your current
problem.

1292
01:34:35,753 --> 01:34:38,268
200 Students Clash in Front of US Embassy

1293
01:34:39,182 --> 01:34:41,776
The activities of the spy agencies will
intensify.

1294
01:34:43,534 --> 01:34:45,956
I will expose them for what they are.

1295
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:51,713
The guys who killed Lee Kishun and others

1296
01:34:52,268 --> 01:34:53,885
I'll find out them

1297
01:34:55,534 --> 01:34:57,674
Ok I get it, hello?

1298
01:34:57,862 --> 01:34:58,573
And then

1299
01:34:59,533 --> 01:35:07,283
The END

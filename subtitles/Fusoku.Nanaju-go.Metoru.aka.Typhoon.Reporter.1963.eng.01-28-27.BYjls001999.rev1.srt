1
00:00:43,508 --> 00:00:44,766
That's terrible

2
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:49,813
The winds are 50 meters high, so the strong winds will blow us away.

3
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:53,985
It's bad enough that we went there to cover the event and there was a typhoon.

4
00:00:54,485 --> 00:00:55,845
But you filmed well

5
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,938
There is another one

6
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:01,009
What's this?

7
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:03,946
This is night view in Ginza

8
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:09,703
We don't notice these neon lights on a daily basis.

9
00:01:10,376 --> 00:01:17,204
Lots of neon for store signs and building ads.

10
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,555
What do you wanna say about?

11
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:28,251
What if bigger typhoon attack Tokyo?

12
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:36,678
These days there are a lot of dirty neon lights and advertisements on top of skyscrapers.

13
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,405
They disturb our lives.

14
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,686
They are at risk of falling down with the wind.

15
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,374
You are saying too much

16
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:57,374
You think so?
There is nothing we can do about natural disasters.

17
00:01:58,264 --> 00:02:01,131
We should be careful about that

18
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:06,194
Current neon can withstand wind speeds of up to 60 meters.

19
00:02:07,061 --> 00:02:08,608
So Don't worry

20
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:14,303
Hold on, Neon and Typhoon..seems interesting

21
00:02:14,952 --> 00:02:17,874
Typhoons come just when you've forgotten about them

22
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:22,421
Typhoons with wind speeds of 60 meters or more are possible.

23
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:32,990
Wind Velocity 75 Meters / Typhoon Reporter (1963)

24
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:28,734
Now we are going to have a lighting ceremony for the neon building.

25
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:36,014
The daughter of the Marutaka company responsible for the construction turns on the switch.

26
00:04:00,434 --> 00:04:06,808
Next, a representative from TOZAI Pharmaceuticals's Fujikawa will address the audience.

27
00:04:09,684 --> 00:04:12,864
I'll address you

28
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:21,992
Today is the 30th anniversary of TOZAI Pharmaceuticals!

29
00:04:23,015 --> 00:04:29,179
It's also the anniversary of the new pharmaceuticals.

30
00:04:30,672 --> 00:04:39,655
Our neon building was completed to commemorate this event!

31
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:46,406
I really appreciate you guys

32
00:04:47,281 --> 00:04:50,101
Thank you for helping us

33
00:04:51,648 --> 00:04:59,070
I really appreciate what you help us.
we want to help you guys too

34
00:05:00,126 --> 00:05:05,837
We will continue to make efforts to develop new drugs

35
00:05:06,751 --> 00:05:13,438
Please enjoy our neon tonight

36
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:18,251
Thank you for having me here today

37
00:05:21,883 --> 00:05:26,571
I'm relieved that the construction will be in time for the lighting ceremony

38
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:28,547
I was not going to get fired.

39
00:05:30,742 --> 00:05:33,852
Our workers worked so hard

40
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:40,438
Yamaguchi's design worked it

41
00:05:40,641 --> 00:05:44,789
Asanuma took to control the site

42
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,555
It is thanks to him that the construction was completed on time.

43
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,766
I'm shy

44
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:53,828
Give me easier work next time

45
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,500
You're funny

46
00:05:57,316 --> 00:05:58,073
Let's toast

47
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:03,144
Welcome

48
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,565
I happen to see u

49
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:08,830
Are you here for congratulate me or scolding me?

50
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,057
What should I say first

51
00:06:12,346 --> 00:06:18,362
Let's be friendly today.
No matter what the weather, this neon stays the same

52
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,604
I hope so

53
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,174
He's here again

54
00:06:26,049 --> 00:06:26,752
Come

55
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:29,159
Thanks for coming,Tamura

56
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:30,315
Congratulation

57
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,034
Thanks

58
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:35,182
I forbid you to associate with her if you bully me

59
00:06:36,377 --> 00:06:37,580
You're good at joking

60
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:39,510
Please have fun

61
00:06:39,698 --> 00:06:40,573
Serve him

62
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:43,955
I got a big fish for you

63
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:47,877
It was so nice fish

64
00:06:53,126 --> 00:07:00,313
He asks me if it's okay if a typhoon with winds of 60 m/s comes.

65
00:07:00,572 --> 00:07:03,353
He's always cuddling with her

66
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,673
You get upset about that?

67
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:10,345
I'm not good at taking care of women.
Not like you

68
00:07:10,486 --> 00:07:11,876
Me? why?

69
00:07:12,134 --> 00:07:17,017
You have a nice wife

70
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,274
Wife...

71
00:07:25,742 --> 00:07:27,750
Please stay little more

72
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:30,993
I wanna see something before seeing my wife

73
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:32,024
What wanna see?

74
00:07:32,345 --> 00:07:33,134
Neon

75
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:45,095
Look

76
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,542
I like how it changes from purple to red

77
00:08:02,865 --> 00:08:04,763
Stay strong

78
00:08:23,058 --> 00:08:24,035
Wait

79
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:35,037
Wait

80
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,901
What? the neon got burn?

81
00:08:52,643 --> 00:08:54,494
You got shot?

82
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,589
It's me

83
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,995
criminal is on the run

84
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,042
I don't know the number

85
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:04,855
It was hard to check it

86
00:09:06,324 --> 00:09:07,808
Ok I get it

87
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,994
Go to police,Kagawa

88
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:13,103
You go too

89
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:17,330
It's dangerous to shoot at midnight

90
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,141
What's wrong?

91
00:09:20,648 --> 00:09:23,726
I can't believe the neon lights I saw 6 hours ago

92
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:26,570
It's someone's harassment

93
00:09:27,383 --> 00:09:31,101
Marutaka Company and another company bid on the construction tender

94
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,203
Endo

95
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:35,898
they raced to the end

96
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:40,391
I was thinking about that too..but I can't believe Endo company did it

97
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,359
It could be

98
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:46,680
I heard that ENDO worked behind the scenes

99
00:09:46,797 --> 00:09:49,586
They are Yakuza from Manshu

100
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,984
Marutaka got famous about this work

101
00:09:54,586 --> 00:09:59,242
Marutaka will take an advantage about Neon work

102
00:09:59,969 --> 00:10:01,976
It's ridiculous to interfere just for that reason

103
00:10:02,891 --> 00:10:04,680
We need to investigate it

104
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:07,008
Connect to Nagoya branch

105
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,867
I feel weird

106
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:14,211
Tonight's case is your job.

107
00:10:23,064 --> 00:10:25,329
Nogoya51568.
it’s urgent

108
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:47,291
Hi, I'm Kitaya

109
00:10:47,424 --> 00:10:48,127
It's me

110
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,103
Oh boss

111
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,627
I’m on schedule

112
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,908
I will arrive in Kobe tomorrow morning

113
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:56,836
Did you book properly?

114
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:57,516
It's fine

115
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:03,305
I made it.
I look forward to reading tomorrow morning's paper

116
00:11:08,016 --> 00:11:09,180
Oh Tamura

117
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,860
You had a hard time

118
00:11:11,016 --> 00:11:11,782
Where's dad?

119
00:11:11,961 --> 00:11:16,118
He went to the hospital with Mr. Yamaguchi.

120
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,678
did he say something about tonight?

121
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,463
Did he say someone interfered?

122
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:27,589
No

123
00:11:29,011 --> 00:11:31,776
Let's see Nagoya Endo company

124
00:11:35,042 --> 00:11:37,003
he didn't say anything

125
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:38,698
what do you think about it?

126
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:39,894
i don't believe it

127
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:42,221
you really doubt them

128
00:11:42,246 --> 00:11:44,480
Forget about this

129
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,113
Why?

130
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:51,464
ask my dad as interview

131
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:58,588
He's coming back

132
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:04,130
how was their condition?

133
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:05,998
They're ok

134
00:12:06,023 --> 00:12:06,967
You had a hard time

135
00:12:07,076 --> 00:12:07,842
I had

136
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:09,029
who do you think is the culprit?

137
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:11,810
I was asked about it by a newspaper reporter at the hospital.

138
00:12:13,068 --> 00:12:15,529
Tamura says that the culprit is Endo.

139
00:12:16,014 --> 00:12:16,865
what do you think?

140
00:12:17,514 --> 00:12:19,935
I have no idea.
it's a police job

141
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:27,367
I'm mad at seeing that destroyed neon

142
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:30,242
we shouldn't be quiet

143
00:12:30,961 --> 00:12:33,430
Don't be mad

144
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,063
We're not Yakuza

145
00:12:38,734 --> 00:12:40,906
But we must draw the line.

146
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:46,235
We have to find solid evidence that Endo did it.

147
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,659
It's not good to speculate.

148
00:12:50,776 --> 00:12:52,847
leave the culprit to the police

149
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,487
we have to remake neon again

150
00:12:59,167 --> 00:13:01,409
what is the construction cost?

151
00:13:04,222 --> 00:13:07,738
Consult with TOZAI Pharmaceutical first. but We will do it whatever happens

152
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,277
I don't care if the company goes bankrupt

153
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:16,230
That NEON has a one-year warranty, so we are responsible.

154
00:13:17,261 --> 00:13:18,394
i don't worry about money

155
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:23,936
Ok?
Please do your best again from tomorrow

156
00:13:24,061 --> 00:13:27,858
Sorry to disturb you

157
00:13:32,528 --> 00:13:36,013
Won't you guys pay for the construction costs?

158
00:13:36,395 --> 00:13:37,497
Of course not

159
00:13:38,309 --> 00:13:43,489
We paid 50 million yen that cost to Marutaka Company.

160
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:50,164
There is a one-year warranty, so any accidents during that time are their responsibility.

161
00:13:50,766 --> 00:13:52,086
You're so cold

162
00:13:52,914 --> 00:13:58,102
This is a contractual issue between companies, so it can't be helped.

163
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:03,853
I've been criticized for building this neon.

164
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:09,697
I have been criticized a lot because I spent too much money.

165
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:14,407
But last night's incident was an unforeseen disaster.

166
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:18,829
Marutaka company accept it.
It's none of your business

167
00:14:21,384 --> 00:14:26,759
Mr. Maruyama came here earlier and said that he will complete it in the middle of next month.

168
00:14:29,193 --> 00:14:32,544
i have a meeting now, sorry

169
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,326
What's wrong?

170
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:01,389
I'll go to the site

171
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,998
the doctor said you should rest

172
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:10,185
I am worried and responsible for NEON

173
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,199
I'm going

174
00:15:18,636 --> 00:15:19,378
What's wrong?

175
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,347
Ok I won't go

176
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:27,613
I just designed it so I don't have to go

177
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:29,559
I'll sleep

178
00:15:34,926 --> 00:15:36,020
I'll sleep

179
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,247
You should go

180
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,044
You sure?

181
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:52,700
I know how you feel

182
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:56,232
You are so sweating

183
00:15:57,685 --> 00:16:02,146
I haven't been home much since I got married. sorry

184
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:04,391
Don't worry. please go

185
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:07,915
What's wrong?

186
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,181
Are you ok?

187
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,728
i feel dizzy

188
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,838
You should rest

189
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:18,924
Is Yamaguchi here?

190
00:16:19,516 --> 00:16:20,828
Thanks for coming

191
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:23,750
Welcome

192
00:16:25,273 --> 00:16:26,156
Thanks

193
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,209
You had a hard time

194
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:31,217
Please rest

195
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:33,678
they are so cruel

196
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:39,694
I'm glad that the only people injured were me and Mr. Asada.

197
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:42,629
Do you also think that Endo interfered?

198
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:47,379
I can't say clearly but I think so

199
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:52,633
WE and Endo Company have been on bad terms for a long time.

200
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:57,969
Whenever we made a bid, he always made a bid too.

201
00:16:58,231 --> 00:17:03,161
They couldn't beat our president, so they always lost and ran away.

202
00:17:03,552 --> 00:17:07,356
They said they would merge with us a year ago.

203
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,809
Of course our boss refused.

204
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:12,380
I didn't know that

205
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,809
I think our boss will have a lot to worry about from now on.

206
00:17:19,942 --> 00:17:22,934
Repair work will cost 50 million yen

207
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:25,614
we have no profit

208
00:17:26,043 --> 00:17:28,192
our company may go bankrupt

209
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:31,484
Don't worry

210
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:40,758
I will see the site from now on

211
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:43,765
I'll see it for you

212
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:47,281
You can go for me

213
00:17:48,226 --> 00:17:49,086
Thanks

214
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:53,424
don't be humble

215
00:17:54,276 --> 00:17:54,885
I feel hot

216
00:17:55,526 --> 00:17:57,674
I'm still single

217
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,080
I'm sorry

218
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,055
You've been having a hard time with the restoration work since this morning.

219
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:05,227
I will do my best for the company

220
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,085
I support you guys.

221
00:18:10,381 --> 00:18:14,772
I thought you dislike NEON because you are a typhoon reporter

222
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:18,308
You're right

223
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:23,465
But I'm annoyed by the background of this incident

224
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,900
Please Write a special article about our company's neon

225
00:18:29,564 --> 00:18:31,596
I'll drop you off at the site

226
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:33,182
Really?

227
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,207
Do you care?

228
00:18:37,715 --> 00:18:40,449
You have other drivers, right?

229
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:44,121
I’m worried about her being kidnapped

230
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,250
it's a good time

231
00:18:52,844 --> 00:18:54,032
What can I do for you?

232
00:18:54,415 --> 00:18:56,094
That black car was found

233
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:56,961
Where?

234
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:57,844
In Kofu

235
00:18:58,032 --> 00:18:58,790
Kofu?

236
00:18:58,985 --> 00:19:00,493
They abandoned the car near the station.

237
00:19:00,829 --> 00:19:04,782
Please go to support Mina-chan

238
00:19:05,336 --> 00:19:07,133
Ok but...

239
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,055
Please write an article about the typhoon later.

240
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:10,907
Prioritize this case

241
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:13,079
I'm counting on you

242
00:19:13,368 --> 00:19:14,563
Leave it to me

243
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:19,165
Kagawa works for the Metropolitan Police Department, so you might know about ENDO from the car.

244
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:33,994
I'm back

245
00:19:34,119 --> 00:19:35,142
Thank you for your hard work

246
00:19:39,556 --> 00:19:42,166
What about Marutaka Company?

247
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:45,666
They panic a lot, but it's okay

248
00:19:47,021 --> 00:19:50,451
They are working again from this morning

249
00:19:50,553 --> 00:19:51,475
Really?

250
00:19:54,364 --> 00:19:57,825
they don't give up easily

251
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:06,013
They are obstructing our advance into Tokyo.

252
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:10,553
I will defeat them by any means necessary.

253
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,069
I know

254
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:16,827
In doing so, we are...

255
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:18,873
Get the phone

256
00:20:22,538 --> 00:20:24,319
This is Endo Industry

257
00:20:25,202 --> 00:20:26,171
Who's there?

258
00:20:28,085 --> 00:20:28,686
Police?

259
00:20:32,254 --> 00:20:34,168
Our boss is out now

260
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:36,223
i am the manager

261
00:20:38,473 --> 00:20:42,145
What did Kuroki and Maruyama do at Asama Onsen?

262
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:45,606
I don't pretend I don't know

263
00:20:45,957 --> 00:20:48,926
we fired them a month ago

264
00:20:49,231 --> 00:20:52,004
They are too dangerous

265
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:56,363
we have nothing to do with them

266
00:21:03,174 --> 00:21:04,471
is the fingerprint ok

267
00:21:08,737 --> 00:21:12,065
they saw your face?

268
00:21:14,354 --> 00:21:15,167
No worries

269
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,004
I heard that a black car was abandoned in front of the station.

270
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,449
i thought i was lucky

271
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,668
you should give up

272
00:21:27,012 --> 00:21:30,637
Employee Caught at Asama Onsen is a Substitute

273
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:35,082
It can't be helped because they confessed themselves and had pistols.

274
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:38,692
The black car is the stolen car..
Damn it

275
00:21:38,817 --> 00:21:40,746
This case will remain unsolved.

276
00:21:41,645 --> 00:21:44,645
The incident may have just begun.

277
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:45,739
just begun?

278
00:21:47,145 --> 00:21:53,934
Endo will definitely take the next action

279
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:58,497
I see.
I'm frustrated tonight

280
00:21:59,621 --> 00:22:00,535
Let's go back

281
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,020
Yes

282
00:22:01,137 --> 00:22:05,090
i will take your stress away

283
00:22:07,044 --> 00:22:09,544
she is very nice

284
00:22:09,903 --> 00:22:11,661
That's good service

285
00:22:14,286 --> 00:22:15,676
please work there

286
00:22:29,757 --> 00:22:31,077
On my god

287
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:37,319
What are you doing?

288
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:39,710
Work harder

289
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:43,694
Don't look at it.
Go back to work

290
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,118
Hello

291
00:22:51,189 --> 00:22:53,423
Did you get better,Yamaguchi

292
00:22:54,032 --> 00:22:57,204
work makes me feel better

293
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,634
your wife is angry with you

294
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,669
The situation is worse than you think?

295
00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,958
Gunpowder destroyed all the neon signs

296
00:23:08,958 --> 00:23:11,192
We have to redo everything

297
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:14,582
But you have a deadline

298
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:17,825
If it's a simple construction, it looks like I'll be able to make it on time

299
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:22,288
But if a typhoon comes, it will be a big problem.

300
00:23:23,749 --> 00:23:25,351
He's here again

301
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:29,101
Thank you for your hard work

302
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:31,812
Oh you are here too

303
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,695
Put this away

304
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,749
Please eat this

305
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,414
Let's take a rest

306
00:23:41,984 --> 00:23:44,281
I have to work

307
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:46,742
It's sweet time

308
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,460
Come to eat

309
00:23:47,874 --> 00:23:48,859
Thanks

310
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,359
Please eat

311
00:23:50,593 --> 00:23:51,984
I'm lucky

312
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:54,804
Do you like sweets?

313
00:23:55,085 --> 00:23:55,953
Yes

314
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,609
That's sweet bum

315
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,515
This is meat?

316
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,160
Please eat a lot

317
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,441
Bring it to me

318
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:05,395
Yes

319
00:24:05,949 --> 00:24:07,559
Thanks

320
00:24:07,793 --> 00:24:09,606
That's good

321
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,941
Where are you looking?

322
00:24:55,253 --> 00:24:57,237
Your fault!

323
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:03,509
Oh you're Kitani

324
00:25:06,822 --> 00:25:08,291
Excuse me but who are you?

325
00:25:08,697 --> 00:25:10,947
I'm Teruko Maruyama

326
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,369
From Hakuba mountaineering

327
00:25:13,814 --> 00:25:14,916
Hakuba mountaineering?

328
00:25:14,941 --> 00:25:15,673
Yes

329
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,320
are you the dark skinned girl?

330
00:25:21,531 --> 00:25:22,781
Yes I am

331
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:25,305
This is a very odd coincidence.

332
00:25:26,352 --> 00:25:27,969
You look different

333
00:25:28,875 --> 00:25:31,438
you haven't changed at all

334
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,813
I'm dumb, so I'm the same as before

335
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,274
No way

336
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,143
You look great

337
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:40,353
i am happy to be praised by you

338
00:25:41,198 --> 00:25:41,729
Smoke?

339
00:25:42,377 --> 00:25:42,893
No

340
00:25:43,448 --> 00:25:44,596
You're still serious

341
00:25:45,819 --> 00:25:47,991
This store is no different too

342
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:51,061
I often come here too

343
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,865
We made a schedule here, didn't we?

344
00:25:53,905 --> 00:25:55,617
Iced coffee,2

345
00:25:57,187 --> 00:25:59,820
you were so stubborn

346
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:04,042
you ended up sticking to your plan

347
00:26:06,504 --> 00:26:07,832
Are you in Tokyo all the way?

348
00:26:08,675 --> 00:26:11,511
Since I came to Tokyo recently, I am at the hotel now.

349
00:26:13,146 --> 00:26:14,247
What do you do?

350
00:26:14,935 --> 00:26:16,677
I am a manager of a small company

351
00:26:17,239 --> 00:26:19,036
here is my business card

352
00:26:21,263 --> 00:26:22,052
You're executive

353
00:26:22,177 --> 00:26:23,068
Just job title

354
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:29,232
have you married yet?

355
00:26:29,257 --> 00:26:31,607
no one will marry me

356
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:34,115
You are too picky

357
00:26:34,615 --> 00:26:38,271
Thanks.
How about you?

358
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:41,029
no one will marry me too

359
00:26:41,341 --> 00:26:44,990
You are too picky

360
00:26:46,492 --> 00:26:47,641
Oh my god

361
00:26:49,094 --> 00:26:50,977
i want to date you from now

362
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,063
Go ahead

363
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,758
do you have time tomorrow night?

364
00:26:55,477 --> 00:26:57,594
i can make time for you

365
00:26:58,092 --> 00:26:59,912
i want you to meet someone

366
00:27:04,246 --> 00:27:06,917
It's been seven years since I met you

367
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:09,917
You belonged to the swimming club and I belonged to the mountaineering club.

368
00:27:10,152 --> 00:27:12,035
we always acted differently

369
00:27:12,534 --> 00:27:15,488
Kappa and mountain man met for the first time in 7 years

370
00:27:15,513 --> 00:27:17,261
Thanks to her

371
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,566
you should thank me more

372
00:27:19,714 --> 00:27:21,511
Yes we do

373
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:27,091
I invited her to join the swimming club, but I understand why she didn't come.

374
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,075
What kind of company is Kono Akatsuki industrial?

375
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,411
This is a new company that does anything

376
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,139
But you're not a funeral or pawn shop director, are you?

377
00:27:38,164 --> 00:27:39,561
no way

378
00:27:40,608 --> 00:27:42,959
We used to go to the pawn shop

379
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:44,545
The shop behind the school?

380
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,974
they took good care of us

381
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:50,303
my watch was taken to a pawn shop

382
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:51,123
Really?

383
00:27:51,148 --> 00:27:52,569
Don't pretend you don't know

384
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:53,712
this was a memento of my mother

385
00:27:53,916 --> 00:27:56,142
he cried to me and asked

386
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:59,947
tonight i will treat you

387
00:27:59,972 --> 00:28:02,915
Let's have fun

388
00:28:05,032 --> 00:28:07,415
You drink nicely

389
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:09,602
Is the job of a journalist interesting?

390
00:28:10,118 --> 00:28:11,602
i like doing this job

391
00:28:11,719 --> 00:28:14,383
he is called a typhoon reporter

392
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:17,922
typhoon reporter?
That's dangerous

393
00:28:18,251 --> 00:28:24,290
Suppose a big typhoon like the Isewan Typhoon comes to Tokyo.

394
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,220
He's started

395
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:28,790
An even bigger typhoon may come to Tokyo.

396
00:28:29,689 --> 00:28:32,658
How would you feel if a typhoon with a wind speed of 65 meters or more hits Tokyo?

397
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:35,939
At high tide in Tokyo Bay at storm surge

398
00:28:35,978 --> 00:28:37,697
What do you think will happen if the levee breaks?

399
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:44,956
If so, 60% of Tokyo residents will be held and 30% will die

400
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,773
160,000 casualties in Tokyo died in WWII in 10 months

401
00:28:52,164 --> 00:28:56,461
A single typhoon causes twice as many casualties

402
00:28:57,346 --> 00:28:59,080
Clam down

403
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:07,707
The citizens of Tokyo must seriously think about the countermeasures.

404
00:29:09,309 --> 00:29:14,356
There are three government agencies related to the reclamation work in Tokyo Bay.

405
00:29:14,637 --> 00:29:16,692
More than 10 companies are contracting the construction.

406
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,106
I don't think you can do the right job in that situation.

407
00:29:19,348 --> 00:29:20,981
I see I see

408
00:29:22,731 --> 00:29:25,051
He always gets excited when he talks about typhoons.

409
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,731
I understand he's typhoon reporter

410
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:33,801
By the way,
what kind of hostess do you like?

411
00:29:35,664 --> 00:29:37,156
I don't want

412
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,133
You dance,right?

413
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:40,242
I won't

414
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:44,195
But let's call

415
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:46,813
Teruko is here

416
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:49,007
I can dance

417
00:29:53,033 --> 00:29:53,900
But

418
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:59,884
Ok I'll leave

419
00:30:01,787 --> 00:30:03,857
Oh I have to go

420
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:06,638
where are you going?

421
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:09,545
I'll see you soon

422
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:10,740
See you

423
00:30:11,613 --> 00:30:12,465
See you

424
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,394
You'll stay here?

425
00:30:18,824 --> 00:30:19,387
Yes

426
00:30:27,463 --> 00:30:28,518
Shall we dance?

427
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:05,650
What's wrong?

428
00:31:08,673 --> 00:31:13,556
I feel I ended up being in Tokyo

429
00:31:23,468 --> 00:31:24,703
I'll do my best

430
00:31:30,867 --> 00:31:34,117
I am currently working on a plan to be a company

431
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:40,047
If it goes well I will be promoted

432
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:54,842
Then....

433
00:32:06,952 --> 00:32:08,960
Is it definitely Akatsuki Industry?

434
00:32:09,632 --> 00:32:12,764
Yes for sure.
The other day you said it was the beginning

435
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,234
I have since contacted the Nagoya office to find out.

436
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,991
That’s good to know

437
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,257
Endo took over Akatsuki industrial for advancing in Tokyo

438
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:29,397
They use violent

439
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:33,725
Akatsuki industrial is small company but has carrier

440
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:41,475
ENDO interferes with Marutaka and Endo use Akatsuki industrial for advancing in Tokyo

441
00:32:42,248 --> 00:32:46,209
I've heard of the name

442
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:50,186
I didn't know Endo took over

443
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:52,951
I'm sure about that

444
00:32:53,100 --> 00:33:00,459
If so, is there evidence that Akatsuki industrial interferes with Marutaka?

445
00:33:01,304 --> 00:33:04,913
I haven't got the evidence yet, but I'm really sure

446
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:09,452
I see..Endo did it

447
00:33:10,101 --> 00:33:11,679
You seem to get lost weight

448
00:33:13,077 --> 00:33:15,187
I was busy

449
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:19,923
Welcome

450
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:23,204
Where have you been?

451
00:33:25,142 --> 00:33:26,556
You always go outside these days

452
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:28,052
You're scary

453
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,912
Serve him

454
00:33:32,099 --> 00:33:35,365
You are too serious.
What happened?

455
00:33:37,659 --> 00:33:40,995
Endo broke our NEON as I thought

456
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:42,901
You sure?

457
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:52,484
According to Tamura, Endo used Akatsuki industrial in Tokyo to do it

458
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,391
Akatsuki industrial

459
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:10,337
What happened?

460
00:34:12,813 --> 00:34:14,657
She's selfish

461
00:34:22,397 --> 00:34:24,350
I am currently working on a plan to be a company

462
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:30,350
If it goes well I will be promoted

463
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,497
Thank for coming

464
00:34:57,566 --> 00:34:58,769
Have a seat

465
00:35:05,498 --> 00:35:06,295
What happened?

466
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:09,553
You have something to do with ENdo?

467
00:35:09,685 --> 00:35:10,428
ENdo?

468
00:35:12,068 --> 00:35:13,248
ENdo?

469
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:14,639
Nagoya ENdo

470
00:35:15,084 --> 00:35:17,795
They interferes with Marutaka

471
00:35:18,787 --> 00:35:21,974
I have no idea

472
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,162
It can't be helped you reply like that

473
00:35:26,389 --> 00:35:27,373
You're rude

474
00:35:28,904 --> 00:35:30,615
I have the evidence

475
00:35:31,822 --> 00:35:33,955
You can't escape

476
00:35:36,556 --> 00:35:40,548
You are not Communist.
Give me a break

477
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:49,273
You didn't know Teruko's father was a president of Marutaka?

478
00:35:55,635 --> 00:35:57,143
You didn't know

479
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:06,490
You didn't do that if you knew it

480
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:14,968
She knows about that?

481
00:36:16,101 --> 00:36:16,890
She knows

482
00:36:27,947 --> 00:36:29,799
I'll definitely solve this

483
00:36:33,078 --> 00:36:34,641
Can you think over?

484
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,102
I'm your friend

485
00:36:57,345 --> 00:36:59,322
I took him to here

486
00:37:01,142 --> 00:37:01,931
Come in

487
00:37:10,543 --> 00:37:13,761
Are you sure anyone will find this

488
00:37:13,786 --> 00:37:14,730
That's what I wanna say

489
00:37:17,364 --> 00:37:20,169
Listen, I have money

490
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:22,333
Work perfectly

491
00:37:23,302 --> 00:37:24,903
I know

492
00:37:25,942 --> 00:37:30,810
Be careful about Marutaka

493
00:37:31,810 --> 00:37:32,997
I know

494
00:37:40,033 --> 00:37:46,509
Laborers for wiring work are hard to gather.

495
00:37:46,534 --> 00:37:47,962
OKOK

496
00:37:48,715 --> 00:37:51,535
We're in trouble

497
00:37:51,988 --> 00:37:57,277
The way we're doing it now, we're not going to make it in time.

498
00:37:58,801 --> 00:38:04,082
Change the power distribution design and cut corners.

499
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:07,137
No way,we can't do that

500
00:38:07,162 --> 00:38:08,652
This is just repair

501
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:09,738
we can't do that

502
00:38:09,763 --> 00:38:10,137
Please

503
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,254
we can't do that

504
00:38:12,852 --> 00:38:15,719
Don't get mad, we need to think about this

505
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:18,360
What should we do then

506
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:21,672
He's here again

507
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,219
He's insist

508
00:38:25,824 --> 00:38:27,230
He's annoying

509
00:38:28,168 --> 00:38:29,426
What's wrong?

510
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:34,707
Power distribution engineers interfered in this morning

511
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:45,004
Hi Tamura.
Is the news in the newspapers the work of ENDO?

512
00:38:45,425 --> 00:38:48,800
I haven't got the evidence yet

513
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:53,082
What?
You wrote this,right?

514
00:38:54,215 --> 00:38:57,168
Why you didn't write clearly?

515
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,480
What the hell, what? our president?

516
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:04,363
Our president got mad now

517
00:39:04,738 --> 00:39:07,137
I'm frustrated with him

518
00:39:08,256 --> 00:39:11,537
He never complains, so everyone likes him.

519
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,466
He does not listen to us

520
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:14,756
Asamuma

521
00:39:16,435 --> 00:39:19,373
What are you doing?
Go back to the site

522
00:39:19,951 --> 00:39:20,920
Look

523
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:22,420
There are new workers today

524
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,701
Work as fast as you can

525
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:26,263
I know

526
00:39:29,652 --> 00:39:30,511
Did you read this?

527
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:31,323
Yes

528
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:32,331
You don't do anything?

529
00:39:32,511 --> 00:39:33,081
For what?

530
00:39:33,253 --> 00:39:33,863
Endo

531
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:34,745
Endo?

532
00:39:34,933 --> 00:39:37,613
They interfered with the timing of the construction deadline.

533
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:43,800
Newspaper doesn't say Endo does it

534
00:39:46,482 --> 00:39:50,927
You are still young but get mad?

535
00:39:53,943 --> 00:39:55,099
Go back to the site

536
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,341
Damn it

537
00:39:58,531 --> 00:39:59,750
Hurry up!

538
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:09,367
A Reporter came and ask me a lot

539
00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:11,820
I wonder Marutaka find something

540
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:18,477
Anyway, watch out about Marutaka,OK?

541
00:40:18,594 --> 00:40:22,453
Are you okay with the worker buyout thing?

542
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:24,969
That Umehara?

543
00:40:26,594 --> 00:40:28,961
Don't worry, I owe him a lot

544
00:40:30,203 --> 00:40:31,789
He won't tell it to anyone

545
00:40:35,693 --> 00:40:38,506
We have a guest. sorry

546
00:40:55,892 --> 00:40:57,415
Have a seat

547
00:41:00,267 --> 00:41:01,033
What's wrong?

548
00:41:07,777 --> 00:41:11,550
Can you go back to Nagoya now?

549
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:12,457
Nagoya?

550
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,488
What's wrong?

551
00:41:18,168 --> 00:41:24,644
If I had my druthers, I would have noticed this when I met you near the construction site.

552
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:28,144
You are talking about the news.
That's fake

553
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:33,254
We have nothing to do with that

554
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:35,926
I guess only Tamura's agent write that

555
00:41:36,691 --> 00:41:41,723
He's mad these days.
This is the list of executives of our company

556
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,515
Don’t pretend you don't know.
I know Endo is behind you

557
00:41:50,101 --> 00:41:52,367
Endo?
No way

558
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:56,123
I'm working hard on my job

559
00:41:56,803 --> 00:41:58,560
You get misunderstanding something

560
00:42:00,693 --> 00:42:02,693
I haven't met him

561
00:42:03,365 --> 00:42:04,170
Kitani

562
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:09,218
Don't make fun of me

563
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,226
Hold on

564
00:42:30,187 --> 00:42:31,562
What the hell?

565
00:42:32,226 --> 00:42:33,414
Oh daughter

566
00:42:33,882 --> 00:42:34,992
Why you are here?

567
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:39,419
I'm here to talk with him

568
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,044
Get out from the site now

569
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:48,013
We are talking about that with her now

570
00:42:48,059 --> 00:42:49,536
I'm not asking about her

571
00:42:50,513 --> 00:42:52,239
My answer is same

572
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:55,364
I refuse it

573
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:00,069
Answer

574
00:43:05,014 --> 00:43:07,756
I know you have something to do with Endo

575
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:10,743
Get out from the site now

576
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:15,876
Sorry.
Bring medicine

577
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:18,821
I'm OK

578
00:43:21,719 --> 00:43:24,462
You guys go home

579
00:43:27,266 --> 00:43:31,266
You have dishonored my father.

580
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:34,609
I can't accept this

581
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:40,797
Our enemy is someone behind Kitani

582
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:47,822
Sorry to disturb you

583
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:10,460
Sorry

584
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:12,436
I'm OK

585
00:44:13,634 --> 00:44:15,728
I'll keep secret what happened

586
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:19,267
Does it hurt?

587
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:21,149
I'm OK

588
00:44:24,089 --> 00:44:24,839
What's wrong?

589
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:29,620
You wanted to help him even if you were injured?

590
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:33,003
It was just happening

591
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:39,120
I thought you loved Tamura all the way

592
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:42,676
But Actually you love Kitani

593
00:44:42,701 --> 00:44:43,497
Don't say bullshit

594
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:53,906
Does Tamura really hold the assurance?

595
00:44:54,594 --> 00:44:57,969
I think so.
So He wrote that on the news paper

596
00:44:58,477 --> 00:45:04,844
His article is problematic.
That is the article I want to fight with Dawn Industries.

597
00:45:06,135 --> 00:45:07,987
They'll interference again for sure

598
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,085
What are you doing,Umehara?

599
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:30,212
Work hard

600
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:44,253
We have all the materials for the NEon

601
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,730
Code is missing

602
00:45:46,776 --> 00:45:47,589
Why?

603
00:45:47,862 --> 00:45:50,276
They ask me to pay first

604
00:45:50,651 --> 00:45:52,050
We have money

605
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:55,132
Call them to bring it

606
00:45:56,031 --> 00:45:57,109
I get it

607
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:01,320
Where's Asanuma now?

608
00:46:04,116 --> 00:46:06,585
You sure that he went to Yanagibashi's bank?

609
00:46:07,296 --> 00:46:08,866
I'm sure

610
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,499
He and Kawakami went there for the loan

611
00:46:15,287 --> 00:46:20,888
Kawakami is a moneylender

612
00:46:21,234 --> 00:46:21,984
I see

613
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:26,328
moneylender

614
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:39,812
However, please entrust your house in Aoyama to me as collateral.

615
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:41,187
That's fine

616
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:45,781
you had a bad experience

617
00:46:46,757 --> 00:46:51,039
I have to complete this task for my pride

618
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:52,750
I see

619
00:46:54,539 --> 00:46:59,805
Please keep our promise,Maruyama

620
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,875
I'll trust you

621
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:18,655
Can you stop it?

622
00:47:21,491 --> 00:47:22,248
Stop it

623
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,033
You?

624
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:41,678
As a result of forensics, Mr. Moriyama was sitting in the back

625
00:48:42,307 --> 00:48:45,651
The driver was shot dead inside the trunk

626
00:48:46,385 --> 00:48:54,033
Nothing else is found because the sea water has washed the inside of the car

627
00:48:54,673 --> 00:48:56,665
nothing was found?

628
00:48:58,391 --> 00:49:05,094
Non-victim fingerprints found on door

629
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:06,696
Related to Endo?

630
00:49:07,048 --> 00:49:08,298
I can't tell

631
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:13,454
All of Maruyama's belongings were taken.

632
00:49:13,938 --> 00:49:16,720
I think it's the work of robbers

633
00:49:21,635 --> 00:49:26,455
Daughter. you keep staying here?

634
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:33,761
What should we do?

635
00:49:34,957 --> 00:49:36,168
Go to the site

636
00:49:38,863 --> 00:49:48,446
Please complete Neon by the deadline for my father

637
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:01,122
Let's go,Asanuma

638
00:50:14,605 --> 00:50:16,340
We're going

639
00:50:27,827 --> 00:50:29,046
Thank you

640
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:33,503
Did you know who killed the president?

641
00:50:35,034 --> 00:50:35,878
Not yet

642
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:43,823
According to the investigative headquarters, before he was killed, he met a man at Yanagiya's restaurant.

643
00:50:45,173 --> 00:50:51,235
They are investigating who was he

644
00:51:39,354 --> 00:51:40,112
Teruko

645
00:51:49,027 --> 00:51:53,691
i can't stand it anymore

646
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:58,777
You might end my friendship with Kitani

647
00:51:59,769 --> 00:52:00,628
Is that Ok?

648
00:52:02,066 --> 00:52:02,956
It can't be helped

649
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:05,282
Do you still love him

650
00:52:05,828 --> 00:52:09,109
Stop talking about him

651
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:17,391
I’m just a journalist

652
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:20,758
i may not be able to help you

653
00:52:21,866 --> 00:52:25,413
But if you have trouble, please consult me

654
00:52:28,966 --> 00:52:30,575
Don't think too much

655
00:52:32,989 --> 00:52:33,911
Take care of yourself

656
00:52:41,079 --> 00:52:47,743
Are you going to buy back Mr. Maruyama's mortgage from me?

657
00:52:47,768 --> 00:52:48,435
Yes

658
00:52:54,012 --> 00:52:56,536
I want your reply now

659
00:52:58,419 --> 00:53:00,379
is this check real?

660
00:53:00,817 --> 00:53:04,262
You can call your bank to confirm that

661
00:53:09,143 --> 00:53:11,643
I get it.
This is my business

662
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:17,901
Since Mr. Maruyama is dead, there is no point in owning his house.

663
00:53:18,417 --> 00:53:22,269
I was going to turn it into money someday.
Let's deal with me

664
00:53:28,093 --> 00:53:31,257
Do you want us to stop this construction?

665
00:53:31,452 --> 00:53:33,367
it's a silly story

666
00:53:33,484 --> 00:53:35,484
80% completed

667
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,046
Why you want us to stop?

668
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:48,316
I am very grateful to Mr. Maruyama, and I am very sorry to tell you about this.

669
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:54,676
If another incident comes, the impression of our company will be bad.

670
00:53:54,785 --> 00:53:56,394
it has nothing to do with construction

671
00:53:56,473 --> 00:54:00,223
It's not irrelevant because I'm requesting an extension of the construction period.

672
00:54:01,473 --> 00:54:04,090
we are waiting for the materials because the materials have not arrived

673
00:54:05,062 --> 00:54:07,531
Anyway we can't wait anymore

674
00:54:10,679 --> 00:54:14,085
We have to complete it on time,right?

675
00:54:14,273 --> 00:54:16,101
It's too late

676
00:54:16,968 --> 00:54:21,687
Please complete within 3 days

677
00:54:22,628 --> 00:54:23,510
3 days?

678
00:54:23,823 --> 00:54:28,495
That NEON was completed once

679
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:33,223
The company's pride was destroyed by that incident.

680
00:54:34,762 --> 00:54:38,340
It's so embarrassing to leave the neon broken garbage

681
00:54:50,472 --> 00:54:51,628
We can make it

682
00:54:53,441 --> 00:54:54,652
Let's do it

683
00:54:55,472 --> 00:54:57,597
3 days are enough

684
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:09,112
As you hear, we keep our promises

685
00:55:09,813 --> 00:55:12,821
Please keep our promise

686
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:16,384
We want to advertise immediately

687
00:55:17,634 --> 00:55:18,774
we keep our promises

688
00:55:23,134 --> 00:55:24,298
Tamura

689
00:55:25,149 --> 00:55:25,853
What?

690
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,165
I have a letter about an article you wrote

691
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:29,007
Read them

692
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:35,609
Most say it's not good to blame Akatsuki Industry

693
00:55:36,114 --> 00:55:38,239
I believe this was written by Akatsuki Industry

694
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:39,840
It could be

695
00:55:40,379 --> 00:55:43,411
Would you rather post the letter or ignore it?

696
00:55:43,997 --> 00:55:45,067
Let's post this

697
00:55:45,753 --> 00:55:47,893
I will write clearly that it is Endo s fault

698
00:55:48,034 --> 00:55:53,723
I will write all the investigations of this investigation, including the sabotage case and Mr. Maruyama's murder case.

699
00:55:55,122 --> 00:55:56,106
Let's do it

700
00:55:57,903 --> 00:56:03,091
Then we can defeat Endo Kogyo with the power of public opinion.

701
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:09,263
But be careful about them

702
00:56:09,739 --> 00:56:11,661
They are too dangerous

703
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,646
So be careful

704
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,872
Tamura, phone call for you

705
00:56:19,647 --> 00:56:21,006
I'm here

706
00:56:23,928 --> 00:56:27,756
I can meet you tonight

707
00:56:32,498 --> 00:56:33,646
Welcome

708
00:56:40,482 --> 00:56:41,584
Welcome

709
00:56:42,545 --> 00:56:43,560
I was going to call you up

710
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:46,076
it was convenient.
Wanna drink something?

711
00:56:51,217 --> 00:56:53,928
Cut it out,Kitani

712
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:56,631
For what?

713
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,069
Don't pretend you don't know

714
00:57:01,412 --> 00:57:02,842
Leave from Endo

715
00:57:05,803 --> 00:57:07,506
That's rubbish

716
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,616
you wrote a lie

717
00:57:12,186 --> 00:57:13,241
You bother me

718
00:57:13,266 --> 00:57:14,194
you think you are innocent?

719
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,710
You wrote a certain industry

720
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,100
That's funny

721
00:57:18,491 --> 00:57:20,280
i didn't write the company name for you

722
00:57:21,350 --> 00:57:22,999
I actually intended to write clearly as Endo industrial

723
00:57:26,147 --> 00:57:28,366
The newspaper company's information network is very reliable.

724
00:57:33,618 --> 00:57:34,650
I see

725
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:40,962
You've become a very dirty man in 7 years

726
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:42,915
It doesn't matter if it's dirty or clean

727
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:49,790
Humans always change in 7 years

728
00:57:51,470 --> 00:57:55,134
Have you ever thought about Teruko's feelings?

729
00:57:55,939 --> 00:58:00,009
don't talk about her

730
00:58:16,251 --> 00:58:17,642
failed negotiations

731
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:22,846
It could be

732
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:29,963
You have no intention of quitting your current job?

733
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:31,471
No

734
00:58:32,790 --> 00:58:34,696
You're not going to dismiss the article, are you?

735
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,173
No

736
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:39,180
I'll write clearly Endo

737
00:58:44,241 --> 00:58:45,257
Hold on

738
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:50,038
let me think for three days

739
00:58:50,712 --> 00:58:51,079
three days?

740
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:51,579
two days ok

741
00:58:54,056 --> 00:58:54,501
What do you think?

742
00:58:58,815 --> 00:58:59,690
I get it

743
00:59:02,104 --> 00:59:03,869
this is our last friendship

744
00:59:04,205 --> 00:59:05,205
Hold on

745
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:09,198
Have one drink

746
00:59:09,276 --> 00:59:09,870
No

747
00:59:11,823 --> 00:59:13,276
Leave me alone

748
00:59:33,028 --> 00:59:35,091
The weather is bad these days

749
00:59:35,489 --> 00:59:40,114
According to the news, another typhoon is coming.

750
00:59:40,631 --> 00:59:48,114
Every year around this time, a typhoon comes and messes up the outside.

751
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:51,497
Japan really has a lot of typhoons.

752
00:59:52,248 --> 00:59:56,232
Do Truk Islands really exist?

753
00:59:56,630 --> 01:00:01,958
A typhoon with a maximum wind speed of 45 M comes to Japan from there.

754
01:00:02,625 --> 01:00:04,789
We should be careful

755
01:00:06,554 --> 01:00:10,789
It would have been very difficult if it had been a dump truck instead of a truck.

756
01:00:17,149 --> 01:00:21,641
did you come here again by plane?

757
01:00:22,906 --> 01:00:24,867
That's cool

758
01:00:25,327 --> 01:00:28,538
i want to get on a plane too

759
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:31,351
i have to win the lottery

760
01:00:31,468 --> 01:00:33,296
I have never won the lottery

761
01:00:34,323 --> 01:00:36,714
But I won 50 yen last month

762
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:38,432
Please leave

763
01:00:38,457 --> 01:00:39,409
For what?

764
01:00:40,777 --> 01:00:41,480
Please leave

765
01:00:41,543 --> 01:00:44,957
do you guys take a bath?

766
01:00:45,176 --> 01:00:46,847
I will go to bed immediately without taking a bath this year

767
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:51,062
I see. please take a rest

768
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:53,086
Good night

769
01:00:59,538 --> 01:01:00,390
Hey

770
01:01:02,374 --> 01:01:03,656
Good night

771
01:01:05,546 --> 01:01:08,406
do not ever mention my name.

772
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:12,312
Are you going to stop interfering with the construction work?

773
01:01:12,523 --> 01:01:13,366
No way

774
01:01:14,827 --> 01:01:18,156
Tamura will pursue further

775
01:01:18,241 --> 01:01:20,077
Beat him

776
01:01:22,458 --> 01:01:23,731
Bring Konishi tomorrow

777
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,528
Even if Tamura is killed, the people at the newspaper company will know.

778
01:01:32,075 --> 01:01:33,958
You don't listen to me?

779
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:35,278
I don't mean that

780
01:01:38,302 --> 01:01:42,731
Tamura has been my friend since I was a student.

781
01:01:43,606 --> 01:01:45,012
So what?

782
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:53,848
i fought with your father in the war in China

783
01:01:55,088 --> 01:02:01,385
your father committed suicide on correction day.
I brought your father's remains to Japan.

784
01:02:02,178 --> 01:02:07,124
I took care of you and sister and paid for the tuition up to the university.

785
01:02:07,835 --> 01:02:10,780
I gave you money for your mother's funeral

786
01:02:11,608 --> 01:02:14,405
you have to thank me

787
01:02:30,694 --> 01:02:32,319
Yes. it's me

788
01:02:33,413 --> 01:02:36,390
What? typhoon?

789
01:02:37,273 --> 01:02:38,101
wind speed is?

790
01:02:38,210 --> 01:02:41,546
The wind speed is 45 M, so there may be damage.

791
01:02:42,007 --> 01:02:44,007
Can you come to the site?

792
01:02:44,523 --> 01:02:46,491
I feel sorry for your wife

793
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:50,241
I'll be there soon

794
01:02:54,968 --> 01:02:56,109
Is typhoon coming?

795
01:02:57,515 --> 01:02:59,820
It seems big.
Turn on the radio

796
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:04,007
I really hate Typhoon

797
01:03:06,093 --> 01:03:12,406
Typhoon No. 12 developed and the central pressure reached 918 mbar.

798
01:03:13,045 --> 01:03:18,483
The typhoon has a maximum wind speed of 45 m/s and is accompanied by heavy rain.

799
01:03:19,787 --> 01:03:23,741
we don't know where the typhoon will land in Japan now.

800
01:03:24,185 --> 01:03:31,224
The scale of the typhoon is believed to be larger than the Isewan Typhoon that came last year.

801
01:03:32,389 --> 01:03:34,686
We're going to the site

802
01:03:34,842 --> 01:03:35,725
Please

803
01:03:35,772 --> 01:03:37,647
we prepare for the typhoon

804
01:03:37,834 --> 01:03:39,319
Thanks

805
01:03:39,693 --> 01:03:42,115
Take care

806
01:03:43,193 --> 01:03:44,451
Take care

807
01:03:47,056 --> 01:03:52,126
Will Typhoon No. 13 come to Japan?

808
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:56,681
is there another typhoon?

809
01:03:57,103 --> 01:03:58,501
Typhoon No. 13 has occurred

810
01:03:58,526 --> 01:03:59,048
Where?

811
01:03:59,073 --> 01:04:00,220
Right behind Typhoon No.

812
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,892
Oh two typhoon

813
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:06,376
No.13 is small but Typhoon No. 12 has a maximum wind speed of 55 M.

814
01:04:06,658 --> 01:04:07,455
Where is it going?

815
01:04:07,556 --> 01:04:09,376
There are three possible paths

816
01:04:09,619 --> 01:04:11,423
Course from Okinawa to Mainland China

817
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:13,619
Course to go to south Kyushu

818
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:17,033
A course that goes all over Japan from Kyushu

819
01:04:17,439 --> 01:04:19,134
Now is the season for typhoon reporters

820
01:04:19,533 --> 01:04:24,908
If that typhoon makes landfall in Japan, it will become the biggest typhoon, even bigger than the Isewan Typhoon.

821
01:04:25,228 --> 01:04:27,673
is there a typhoon?

822
01:04:28,111 --> 01:04:30,212
If you come, we will suffer great damage.

823
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:33,298
If it comes to Tokyo, it will be around evening tomorrow.

824
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:38,478
It is dangerous to work halfway

825
01:04:41,986 --> 01:04:43,845
Where have you been?

826
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:45,869
I was in toilet

827
01:04:46,009 --> 01:04:49,017
You've been acting strange lately.

828
01:04:49,173 --> 01:04:50,923
No way

829
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:56,640
You instructed the illegal construction, didn't you?

830
01:04:56,749 --> 01:04:58,007
No way

831
01:04:58,032 --> 01:05:00,061
Endo asked you?

832
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:02,343
Or Akatsuki?

833
01:05:02,413 --> 01:05:04,249
I don't know anything

834
01:05:04,952 --> 01:05:08,319
never come here again!

835
01:05:16,851 --> 01:05:17,796
Really?

836
01:05:18,202 --> 01:05:19,187
He's basted

837
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:21,835
We need  more workers

838
01:05:24,593 --> 01:05:27,000
It's me, what?

839
01:05:28,242 --> 01:05:29,406
You need more workers?

840
01:05:29,531 --> 01:05:32,304
we want perfect construction

841
01:05:33,125 --> 01:05:34,547
Can you handle it?

842
01:05:35,344 --> 01:05:36,929
Sorry for being late

843
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:41,398
Tell me how is the site?

844
01:05:42,226 --> 01:05:44,539
they were doing emergency work

845
01:05:44,672 --> 01:05:47,101
We'll see how it goes

846
01:05:47,828 --> 01:05:52,562
I got a mortgage on MARUTAKA from Mr. Kawakami.

847
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:55,767
Tamura is the problem

848
01:05:58,493 --> 01:06:03,626
Typhoon No. 12 increased in strength and the maximum wind speed reached 60 M.

849
01:06:04,095 --> 01:06:07,447
Heading north after passing through Okinawa

850
01:06:08,057 --> 01:06:12,620
It is currently unknown whether the typhoon will make landfall in Kyushu or mainland Japan.

851
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:17,253
The Kanto region will enter the storm zone at night.

852
01:06:19,518 --> 01:06:21,698
The promise with Tamura is until tomorrow, right?

853
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:25,839
Yes

854
01:06:27,214 --> 01:06:28,182
OK

855
01:06:36,782 --> 01:06:40,555
Shiodome 10 people ,Ao 5,Take 10,

856
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,516
A total of 25 people come to help

857
01:06:43,922 --> 01:06:44,719
Thank you

858
01:06:45,088 --> 01:06:46,963
That's enough

859
01:06:47,752 --> 01:06:49,799
Leave it to us

860
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,526
I'm counting on you guys

861
01:06:53,459 --> 01:06:58,709
Kyushu will enter the storm zone and there will be a lot of damage

862
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:04,435
Typhoon No. 12 is moving north at 50 km/h.

863
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:10,584
Typhoon No. 12 is expected to make landfall through the Kii Peninsula.

864
01:07:12,358 --> 01:07:15,217
Be careful with fishing boats

865
01:07:15,295 --> 01:07:17,115
He's coming

866
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:20,826
Damn it.
Tamura!

867
01:07:31,575 --> 01:07:33,325
Hey, what are you doing?

868
01:07:37,766 --> 01:07:41,673
About 25 people go to the construction site.

869
01:07:43,345 --> 01:07:45,368
They won't give up

870
01:07:56,256 --> 01:07:57,295
He's coming

871
01:07:57,646 --> 01:07:58,279
Really?

872
01:07:58,904 --> 01:08:00,631
I have to go

873
01:08:03,584 --> 01:08:05,303
I mean, Typhoon

874
01:08:09,292 --> 01:08:13,948
Typhoon No. 12 recorded a maximum wind speed of 60 M on the Kii Peninsula.

875
01:08:14,534 --> 01:08:19,565
Typhoon No. 12 is getting bigger and continuing northward.

876
01:08:19,854 --> 01:08:24,206
The center of the typhoon will pass through Tokyo at around 6 o'clock tonight.

877
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:29,049
There is no risk of high tide as it is not at high tide

878
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:37,178
The wind is very strong, so please reinforce your house and secure drinking water.

879
01:08:37,585 --> 01:08:43,351
Be careful as power outages and flooding may send

880
01:08:43,684 --> 01:08:45,379
This is the current situation

881
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:46,418
how about the army?

882
01:08:46,911 --> 01:08:49,481
They are waiting

883
01:08:49,770 --> 01:08:50,825
Kamata region situation?

884
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:54,095
This is the countermeasures headquarters

885
01:08:54,439 --> 01:09:01,954
Typhoon No. 12 suddenly changed its course to the north off the coast of Enshunada.

886
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:07,498
The Kanto region is likely to be out of the typhoon zone.

887
01:09:13,572 --> 01:09:18,134
Typhoon is not coming

888
01:09:18,939 --> 01:09:20,877
Typhoon is not coming?

889
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,969
Kanto region will be safe

890
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,934
It was close

891
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,028
Oops

892
01:09:36,943 --> 01:09:40,638
Please don't worry and keep working

893
01:09:58,653 --> 01:10:01,067
You can sleep well tonight

894
01:10:01,403 --> 01:10:03,396
I'm worried about another incident happening

895
01:10:03,421 --> 01:10:05,333
I'm going home earlier

896
01:10:06,366 --> 01:10:07,366
You run away

897
01:10:08,459 --> 01:10:10,397
I wanna drink

898
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,842
do you want to get drunk alone?

899
01:10:14,867 --> 01:10:17,756
Let's call to Yocchan

900
01:10:21,354 --> 01:10:24,042
Hi, oh Kagawa?

901
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,815
What?
The typhoon changed its course?

902
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:34,120
The typhoon has increased its speed and is now 45 kilometers per hour.

903
01:10:34,743 --> 01:10:36,618
Wind speed is 60 M

904
01:10:37,173 --> 01:10:39,415
Lands in mainland Japan around 10:00

905
01:10:40,532 --> 01:10:44,806
Landing point is Tokyo exactly

906
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:47,152
The high tide in Tokyo Bay is at 10:10.

907
01:10:47,778 --> 01:10:50,371
I will be big problem.
I'll call you later

908
01:10:51,635 --> 01:10:52,760
He's coming

909
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:54,088
We shouldn't have been optimistic

910
01:10:56,565 --> 01:10:59,221
Let's act as planned tonight

911
01:11:00,385 --> 01:11:01,190
How about you?

912
01:11:01,401 --> 01:11:02,370
I'll stay

913
01:11:03,569 --> 01:11:04,257
Hi

914
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:08,358
Are they doing construction when the typhoon is coming?

915
01:11:10,194 --> 01:11:11,538
Marutaka?
Really?

916
01:11:23,494 --> 01:11:24,572
I see

917
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,127
So Tamura is going

918
01:11:28,737 --> 01:11:29,604
He's my friend

919
01:11:31,016 --> 01:11:33,750
I have to do something

920
01:11:40,686 --> 01:11:44,960
A storm would be convenient, so go after him right away.

921
01:11:46,913 --> 01:11:50,272
blackmail him

922
01:11:53,508 --> 01:11:58,000
If he throw away the articles so far, say you won't kill him

923
01:11:59,047 --> 01:12:00,922
He's your friend

924
01:12:08,255 --> 01:12:10,575
Kill him if he refuse

925
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:21,804
I ask konishi to support you

926
01:12:23,445 --> 01:12:28,312
He will watch how you solve

927
01:12:51,526 --> 01:12:55,830
We have to make it by tonight.
We are about to complete

928
01:12:56,557 --> 01:12:59,901
You guys don't know how Typhoon is scary

929
01:13:19,484 --> 01:13:23,031
Get them away, and we will save here

930
01:13:23,475 --> 01:13:28,169
Only a portion of the power distribution system remains.

931
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:31,693
Watch out.
What if Neon fall down

932
01:13:32,655 --> 01:13:35,709
That Neon is like my child

933
01:13:35,842 --> 01:13:37,951
You don't know how we feel

934
01:13:38,108 --> 01:13:40,553
It's impossible

935
01:13:41,594 --> 01:13:46,258
You have to run. It's not safe.

936
01:13:47,766 --> 01:13:49,321
Leave from here

937
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:50,881
You get out

938
01:13:52,584 --> 01:13:53,498
You stupid

939
01:13:57,779 --> 01:13:59,357
Leave from here

940
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,162
Leave from here

941
01:14:04,014 --> 01:14:05,459
Leave from here

942
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:12,253
You must lead them

943
01:14:13,261 --> 01:14:14,417
I'll leave it to you

944
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:17,316
Save them!

945
01:14:26,145 --> 01:14:29,426
You say Neon will be fall down

946
01:14:30,301 --> 01:14:35,387
But I wanna see how it goes

947
01:14:35,786 --> 01:14:37,871
She's saying right

948
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:43,629
If My dad is alive, I'm sure we won't leave

949
01:14:43,795 --> 01:14:46,342
You don't believe what I say?

950
01:14:46,982 --> 01:14:50,139
I wanna do what I want

951
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,644
Don't waste time.
Leave from here

952
01:14:59,034 --> 01:15:00,612
You're crazy

953
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,638
Go home

954
01:15:09,576 --> 01:15:10,763
Go home

955
01:15:12,983 --> 01:15:14,405
Go home

956
01:16:01,370 --> 01:16:02,284
Tamura

957
01:16:07,403 --> 01:16:08,458
I need to talk with you

958
01:16:12,708 --> 01:16:15,067
What?
You want to reply?

959
01:16:15,907 --> 01:16:17,556
You decided to leave from Endo?

960
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:22,220
Can you leave from that case?

961
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:23,876
I can't

962
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:26,853
I'll write the truth

963
01:16:27,853 --> 01:16:29,556
You don't listen to me?

964
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:35,040
You should wake up

965
01:16:35,782 --> 01:16:37,056
You don't listen to me?

966
01:16:37,462 --> 01:16:40,579
You insist.
I'll write the truth

967
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:43,986
I'll write about what Endo does

968
01:16:44,087 --> 01:16:45,220
Hold on

969
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:50,134
You're going to die

970
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:57,618
You show how you are.
That's what is Endo doing

971
01:16:59,974 --> 01:17:02,732
And you are his dog

972
01:17:03,646 --> 01:17:05,115
You leave or not?

973
01:17:05,693 --> 01:17:06,896
You leave

974
01:17:06,921 --> 01:17:07,779
Don't say bullshit

975
01:17:07,811 --> 01:17:08,942
You are under control by Endo

976
01:17:09,130 --> 01:17:09,997
It's none of your business

977
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:13,466
You'll be arrested

978
01:17:13,927 --> 01:17:15,450
That's matter of time

979
01:17:16,009 --> 01:17:22,861
I'll expose everything what endo did

980
01:17:23,968 --> 01:17:25,171
You don't have to

981
01:17:29,007 --> 01:17:30,007
Konishi

982
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:34,923
Tamura

983
01:17:41,797 --> 01:17:44,688
Next your turn

984
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:49,837
You'll be dead

985
01:17:51,994 --> 01:17:52,728
You

986
01:17:53,556 --> 01:17:54,845
Don't get angry

987
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:59,157
Boss told me to kill you guys

988
01:17:59,243 --> 01:18:00,282
Don't say bullshit

989
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:03,079
I believe in him

990
01:18:03,477 --> 01:18:11,462
Boss told me to kill you guys.
and promote me

991
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:07,402
Tamura

992
01:20:08,621 --> 01:20:09,699
Tamura

993
01:20:10,707 --> 01:20:11,371
Tamura

994
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,995
You OK?

995
01:20:20,852 --> 01:20:21,781
Hold on

996
01:20:23,406 --> 01:20:24,219
Sorry

997
01:20:26,143 --> 01:20:27,182
You OK?

998
01:20:27,213 --> 01:20:27,893
I'm OK

999
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,166
BE patient

1000
01:20:35,979 --> 01:20:37,268
Sorry

1001
01:20:38,038 --> 01:20:40,499
Thank,Kitani

1002
01:20:43,655 --> 01:20:45,491
Feel better?

1003
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:52,462
Kitani

1004
01:21:22,821 --> 01:21:24,711
Tamura.
You OK?

1005
01:21:27,576 --> 01:21:28,443
Kitani

1006
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,935
Teruko is on the roof

1007
01:21:33,584 --> 01:21:39,131
She'll be in danger.
She doesn’t listen to me

1008
01:21:39,999 --> 01:21:43,374
Save her,KItani

1009
01:22:40,416 --> 01:22:42,870
Teruko

1010
01:22:45,307 --> 01:22:46,252

01:22:47,354 --> 01:22:48,526
Where are you?

1012
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:57,184
Watch out!

1013
01:23:24,687 --> 01:23:25,742
Kitani

1014
01:23:27,788 --> 01:23:29,101
You OK?

1015
01:23:33,142 --> 01:23:33,986
Kitani

1016
01:23:35,228 --> 01:23:36,080
Kitani

1017
01:23:37,572 --> 01:23:38,423
Kitani

1018
01:23:40,332 --> 01:23:41,316
Kitani

1019
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:44,574
Teruko

1020
01:23:47,551 --> 01:23:50,527
Tamura is nice guy

1021
01:23:54,357 --> 01:23:56,653
He's so kind

1022
01:23:59,794 --> 01:24:00,653
Kitani

1023
01:24:02,403 --> 01:24:03,232
Kitani

1024
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:05,356
Kitani

1025
01:24:06,621 --> 01:24:07,801
Kitani

1026
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:10,621
Leave from here

1027
01:24:14,225 --> 01:24:15,186
Kitani

1028
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:17,819
You should give up

1029
01:24:21,999 --> 01:24:23,303
Be strong

1030
01:24:31,806 --> 01:24:33,032
Kitani

1031
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,239
I finally understand how Typhoon is scary

1032
01:26:48,107 --> 01:26:49,130
What you said was right

1033
01:26:50,466 --> 01:26:53,037
Humans cannot win against the forces of nature.

1034
01:26:54,923 --> 01:26:59,001
A typhoon is a natural disaster, so it can't be helped

1035
01:27:00,017 --> 01:27:02,259
I don't think so

1036
01:27:04,400 --> 01:27:08,548
Typhoons are not natural disasters but also man-made disasters.

1037
01:27:09,751 --> 01:27:10,642
man-made disasters.

1038
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:13,994
Typhoons are not natural disasters but also man-made disasters.

1039
01:27:15,455 --> 01:27:18,392
We must always take steps to prevent that.

1040
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,945
I'll keep writing the post

1041
01:27:25,914 --> 01:27:29,016
To prevent a disaster like this from happening again

1042
01:27:31,073 --> 01:27:37,120
that's one way to comfort the victim

1043
01:27:40,070 --> 01:27:42,210
Typhoons are not natural disasters but also man-made disasters.

1044
01:27:43,359 --> 01:27:45,992
We must prevent it

1045
01:27:50,984 --> 01:27:57,125
A typhoon with a wind speed of 75 meters or more may come.

1046
01:28:07,176 --> 01:28:12,985
THE END

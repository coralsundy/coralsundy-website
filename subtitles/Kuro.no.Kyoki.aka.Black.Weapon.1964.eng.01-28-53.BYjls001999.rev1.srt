00:00:12,273 --> 00:00:19,195
Black Weapon

3
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:29,961
At that time, each electric machine manufacturer was

4
00:00:30,164 --> 00:00:32,070
mass-producing TVs.

5
00:00:34,063 --> 00:00:35,656
They produced 60,000 TVs a month

6
00:00:36,844 --> 00:00:38,633
2500 units per day on average

7
00:00:39,835 --> 00:00:44,078
One TV was produced every 12 seconds

8
00:00:45,929 --> 00:00:47,844
To win the competition in this business

9
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:51,734
Manufacturers have made their TVs bigger and smaller.

10
00:00:52,789 --> 00:00:55,031
Or aimed at popularizing color TV

11
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:56,672
Anyway

12
00:00:57,164 --> 00:00:59,586
They needed a new idea

13
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:27,117
Hey, there is something inside

14
00:01:27,289 --> 00:01:28,836
What? I have some one

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:29,758
Me too

16
00:01:31,055 --> 00:01:31,898
Bar angel

17
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:33,453
It's strange

18
00:01:33,742 --> 00:01:35,086
I wonder who put this in

19
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:37,141
What's the matter?

20
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,820
We can drink a glass of highball for free with this ticket

21
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,945
Hmm...I think you will be billed elsewhere

22
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:44,555
Recently, there are many bars that overcharge

23
00:01:45,156 --> 00:01:45,906
I give you this

24
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,117
I can't drink

25
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:48,297
You sure?

26
00:01:48,914 --> 00:01:49,727
Then I will take this

27
00:01:49,752 --> 00:01:50,086
I appreciate it

28
00:01:50,289 --> 00:01:51,016
So we can drink tonight

29
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:54,813
This one service ticket made my life go crazy

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,484
The bar was a cheesy bar like everywhere

31
00:02:09,883 --> 00:02:11,250
Hostess came to service

32
00:02:12,977 --> 00:02:15,031
After we drank highball there

33
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,813
We felt good so we ordered another cup

34
00:02:19,398 --> 00:02:20,852
It was good drinking

35
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:24,039
I got drunk comfortably

36
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:47,008
Then, all of a sudden

37
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,680
A woman appeared in front of me

38
00:02:50,195 --> 00:02:54,195
She was so beautiful that I couldn't see her face

39
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:57,539
Hey, Shall we dance?

40
00:02:59,344 --> 00:03:00,344
I'm bad dancer

41
00:03:00,773 --> 00:03:01,727
It's Ok

42
00:03:17,078 --> 00:03:18,648
You are doing great

43
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:19,531
Keep going

44
00:03:22,594 --> 00:03:23,352
Good

45
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:25,094
Good couple!

46
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:28,445
I want you to come here again

47
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:29,672
Only you

48
00:03:31,914 --> 00:03:33,016
Please keep it secret

49
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:51,219
The next day

50
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,102
I came to see Reiko alone

51
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,875
Welcome

52
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:04,523
Welcome

53
00:04:09,633 --> 00:04:12,859
She treated me like a different person from last night

54
00:04:14,156 --> 00:04:16,422
I was like her regular customer

55
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:18,219
But

56
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:21,484
I'm just a worker, why she treat me well

57
00:04:22,391 --> 00:04:23,852
Why was she so familiar?

58
00:04:48,393 --> 00:04:49,447
Let's dance

59
00:04:55,752 --> 00:04:56,306
You know what?

60
00:04:57,307 --> 00:04:59,346
What time do you finish work on Saturday

61
00:05:00,658 --> 00:05:02,322
5 pm as usual

62
00:05:03,447 --> 00:05:04,478
Can you leave the company early?

63
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,080
Are we going somewhere?

64
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:11,025
I want to go for a drive

65
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:12,596
You want to go for a drive?

66
00:05:14,135 --> 00:05:15,252
I was surprised but

67
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:17,939
I can go for a drive with her

68
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:20,627
I was excited to think about it

69
00:05:25,252 --> 00:05:27,385
Is that good? Promise me

70
00:05:29,799 --> 00:05:31,025
1PM on Saturday

71
00:05:33,244 --> 00:05:34,189
How is this car?

72
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:35,572
Hmm

73
00:05:38,143 --> 00:05:39,283
That's good

74
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:41,393
Is it bad that bar hostess has car?

75
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,080
I don't mean it

76
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:47,478
I think you make a lot of money

77
00:05:48,385 --> 00:05:51,041
All the salary from the shop is used for clothes

78
00:05:51,775 --> 00:05:52,580
Then why you have a lot of money?

79
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:54,557
I'm investing in stocks

80
00:05:55,924 --> 00:05:56,471
You are investing in stocks

81
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,736
Investing in stocks is lucrative.

82
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,002
Stock research and courage are needed

83
00:06:03,424 --> 00:06:04,627
I'm not into that

84
00:06:05,127 --> 00:06:05,689
Why?

85
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:08,518
Because I don't have the current funds

86
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,369
It's okay if you borrow money

87
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:13,260
I can loan you the money

88
00:06:15,447 --> 00:06:17,119
You should buy the stock of your company

89
00:06:17,947 --> 00:06:19,900
Dainippon Electric's stock is an excellent stock

90
00:06:23,893 --> 00:06:24,932
Are you assigned to the inspection department?

91
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:25,838
Yes

92
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:28,697
How long have you been working there?

93
00:06:29,275 --> 00:06:30,393
It's been exactly three and a half years

94
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:35,221
I'm currently attending a night school at a university.

95
00:06:35,885 --> 00:06:36,916
After graduating from school, you will become an engineer

96
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:40,330
Of course I will be promoted to a full-time employee

97
00:06:40,705 --> 00:06:43,174
So You shouldn't go to the bar

98
00:06:43,932 --> 00:06:47,127
I have time to go to your bar on the way home from work

99
00:06:48,244 --> 00:06:50,252
But I don't have enough money

100
00:06:51,361 --> 00:06:53,564
However, if I become a full-time employee, my monthly salary will more than double.

101
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:57,072
It ’s your dream to be an engineer

102
00:06:57,377 --> 00:06:57,799
Yes

103
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:19,260
You know what

104
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:20,682
What?

105
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:22,525
Shall we stay one night here?

106
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:25,072
What? We won't go back to Osaka?

107
00:07:27,471 --> 00:07:28,643
I think it's ok just one night

108
00:07:29,393 --> 00:07:30,783
Your mother will worry about you?

109
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:32,314
Hum

110
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:35,518
You know what

111
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:04,791
I was crazy about her

112
00:08:12,557 --> 00:08:14,025
Regarding the stock of Dainippon Electric

113
00:08:14,455 --> 00:08:15,760
There is information on the stock price increases

114
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,643
Why don't you buy it seriously?

115
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,103
What is the information on stock price increases?

116
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:21,384
RV-17 mission

117
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:24,322
It ’s a new product that your company is making right now.

118
00:08:25,455 --> 00:08:28,307
If the product is revolutionary, the stock price will rise.

119
00:08:29,627 --> 00:08:34,033
But We don't know well what is RV-17 like

120
00:08:34,939 --> 00:08:37,494
It seems that something is being prototyped at the laboratory

121
00:08:39,244 --> 00:08:41,799
Can you research what is it for me?

122
00:08:42,932 --> 00:08:45,057
Once I get that information, I will buy a lot of stock

123
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:49,025
I think the stock price will go up to the 300 yen level for sure

124
00:08:49,525 --> 00:08:51,814
If I sell the stock there, I will get a profit of 1.7 million yen.

125
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,932
I was crazy about Reiko

126
00:09:23,158 --> 00:09:26,994
I investigated Operation RV 17 to please her

127
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:44,311
What are you doing?

128
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:46,545
Well..nothing

129
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:50,108
What do you mean?

130
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,943
Actually, I accidentally dumped something in the trash

131
00:09:55,475 --> 00:09:57,811
It's not big deal but it's a baseball ticket

132
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,779
This incinerator is for the Central Research Laboratory only.

133
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,350
We don't burn such waste paper

134
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:05,990
Is that so?

135
00:10:07,365 --> 00:10:08,545
I'm so sorry, sir.

136
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:33,810
I don't know for sure yet but

137
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:37,529
Look this

138
00:10:37,967 --> 00:10:38,740
What is this?

139
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,592
This is probably a cathode ray tube glass

140
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,943
This was in the incinerator of the laboratory

141
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:46,006
Let me see

142
00:10:47,451 --> 00:10:49,881
Is this related to the new product?

143
00:10:50,256 --> 00:10:52,998
I think so, I need to survey more

144
00:10:53,974 --> 00:10:55,974
Anyway this is not made by our company

145
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:57,990
The thickness is different

146
00:10:58,834 --> 00:11:00,357
Can I get this?

147
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,959
What? You want to survey this?

148
00:11:03,678 --> 00:11:04,818
I will ask someone to survey this

149
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,756
I was disgusted before

150
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:12,888
There was news that color TVs will be released by towa Electric

151
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,568
I didn't do my research at the time and spent all my money to buy stocks.

152
00:11:19,467 --> 00:11:20,685
That was fake

153
00:11:20,787 --> 00:11:23,193
Yes true, I lost all money

154
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,810
Oh yeah, I will survey more for you

155
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:32,896
I'm counting on you.
If I make a profit, I'll share it with you.

156
00:11:38,568 --> 00:11:39,248
I'm back

157
00:11:39,342 --> 00:11:40,873
Welcome home

158
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,287
You're home late.

159
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:43,771
Um

160
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:44,912
What's wrong with you?

161
00:11:45,224 --> 00:11:48,849
I met my friend.
You should have slept earlier

162
00:11:49,217 --> 00:11:51,459
Do you eat inari?

163
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,615
Yes I want to eat

164
00:11:53,974 --> 00:11:56,092
The water has become lukewarm.

165
00:11:56,117 --> 00:11:56,826
I don't care

166
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,092
By the way, Mom

167
00:12:00,318 --> 00:12:00,842
What?

168
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,303
I have something very important to tell you.

169
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:05,146
What is that?

170
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:10,756
You know what

171
00:12:10,881 --> 00:12:11,553
What?

172
00:12:12,201 --> 00:12:13,607
Shall I massage your shoulders?

173
00:12:13,826 --> 00:12:14,467
What?

174
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,599
Don't worry, Please eat it

175
00:12:17,732 --> 00:12:19,381
I'm sure you are hungry

176
00:12:19,678 --> 00:12:22,334
I think I'm getting marry with someone

177
00:12:23,404 --> 00:12:24,896
What? Really?

178
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,224
Are you sure?

179
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,443
She is so modern

180
00:12:29,888 --> 00:12:32,154
She is beautiful and has a very bright personality

181
00:12:32,482 --> 00:12:34,138
I think you will like her too

182
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:38,248
I see, so you are home late recently

183
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:39,623
You know what, Mom

184
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:41,881
Do you approve of us?

185
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:45,990
If you want to, of course I'll support you.

186
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:50,904
I want you to be an engineer soon

187
00:12:51,334 --> 00:12:53,099
And find good wife

188
00:12:53,287 --> 00:12:54,818
That's all I hope

189
00:12:55,381 --> 00:12:56,396
Thank you, Mom

190
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,357
This is what the glass looks like when restored from its thickness and curvature.

191
00:13:24,295 --> 00:13:26,271
This is a about 6 inch cathode ray tube

192
00:13:27,584 --> 00:13:28,193
6 inch

193
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,818
So this is Dainippon Electric's RV 17.

194
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,724
Yes.
This is a groundbreaking micro TV

195
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,318
Did you call me, Chief?

196
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:14,334
katayanagi-kun,
I'm going to have to ask you to leave the company.

197
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:16,209
What?

198
00:14:16,842 --> 00:14:18,795
You know the reason

199
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,381
The union also approved your dismissal

200
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,771
I don't think there is any reason to be fired

201
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:28,451
You didn't know?

202
00:14:29,357 --> 00:14:30,810
We have been monitoring your behavior all the time

203
00:14:31,576 --> 00:14:34,857
The woman at your friend's bar was a Taiyo Electric spy

204
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,646
Are you sure?

205
00:14:39,217 --> 00:14:40,623
Don't pretend you don't know

206
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:43,646
I didn't know that

207
00:14:45,084 --> 00:14:46,904
I was just asked about stocks by her

208
00:14:48,412 --> 00:14:51,279
Chief! Trust me!

209
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:53,068
I didn't know she was spy

210
00:14:53,881 --> 00:14:56,451
I didn't mean that...

211
00:14:58,193 --> 00:14:59,982
I didn't feel like betraying our company

212
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:06,545
But As a result you betrayed our company

213
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,927
Get a severance pay at the accounting department

214
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:13,630
Damn it!

215
00:15:27,794 --> 00:15:28,138
What happened?

216
00:15:28,163 --> 00:15:28,810
Is Reiko-san in?

217
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:29,802
Hasn't she come yet?

218
00:15:30,106 --> 00:15:32,427
Oh, she left day before yesterday

219
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:34,138
She left?

220
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:35,466
Yes suddenly

221
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:39,981
Do you know where she has gone?

222
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:45,130
Well...She is a beautiful girl, so she was invited by various men

223
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:47,270
I wonder she has gone to Minami

224
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:49,364
Is it urgent?

225
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:50,411
No...

226
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:52,825
Never mind

227
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:18,965
It ’s your dream to be an engineer

228
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,614
You are so sweet

229
00:16:29,513 --> 00:16:30,388
Damn it

230
00:16:31,238 --> 00:16:32,004
I will do it

231
00:16:33,036 --> 00:16:33,856
I will do it!

232
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:38,888
I will be an industrial spy and take revenge

233
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,614
Taiyo Electric deceived me

234
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,762
Taiyo Electric broke my dreams and future

235
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:45,450
I will beat them

236
00:16:47,192 --> 00:16:49,966
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

237
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,185
3 years later

238
00:17:06,802 --> 00:17:08,770
Where we will stay tonight?

239
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:09,997
I want to stay on the Shima Peninsula

240
00:17:10,927 --> 00:17:12,872
The meeting in Nagoya ends around 3 o'clock

241
00:17:13,716 --> 00:17:15,130
I want to come to the Ise Peninsula

242
00:17:15,317 --> 00:17:16,309
I'm glad

243
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:18,333
I've never been there

244
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:21,184
It ’s so beautiful that it ’s called the island of pearls.

245
00:17:24,224 --> 00:17:25,591
It's a call.

246
00:17:26,997 --> 00:17:28,997
Mr. Takasugi of Dainippon Electric

247
00:17:29,794 --> 00:17:31,661
Mr. Takasugi of Dainippon Electric

248
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:37,161

00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:41,778
You can leave your bag here

251
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:42,552
Don't worry

252
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,349

253
00:17:58,606 --> 00:18:00,450

I am Tokuda of our company

259
00:18:11,052 --> 00:18:16,465
It seems that a person from Taiyo Electric is on the train aiming at your bag.

260
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:17,942
Does it make sense?

261
00:18:18,614 --> 00:18:19,177
Yes

262
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,169

Yes

264
00:18:23,809 --> 00:18:28,536
Then Shindo of the Yokkaichi Branch will be your guard.

265
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,591
Shindo, right?

266
00:18:30,044 --> 00:18:31,106

269
00:18:50,864 --> 00:18:51,567
What happened?

270
00:18:51,989 --> 00:18:52,934
It's not big deal

271
00:18:53,442 --> 00:18:54,825
That's good to hear

272
00:18:55,817 --> 00:18:58,161
Look, what is that?

273
00:19:10,724 --> 00:19:14,474
Would you like Snacks, beers, and Tobacco?

274
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:18,934
Would you like Snacks, beers, and Tobacco?

275
00:19:19,138 --> 00:19:24,192
Yokkkaichi,Yokkkaichi,Yokkkaichi,Yokkkaichi

00:19:33,552 --> 00:19:34,130
Nice to meet you

280
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:35,466
Thank you for your work

281
00:19:35,684 --> 00:19:37,200
Did you get a call from our department chief?

282
00:19:37,356 --> 00:19:37,833
Yes

283
00:19:38,466 --> 00:19:40,356
There is something I want to talk with you

284
00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:54,528
According to the director, the Taiyo electric spy on the train is aiming at your bag.

285
00:19:55,239 --> 00:19:57,872
So Do not be alone

286
00:19:58,513 --> 00:20:01,059
I'll take care of your bag when you go to toilet

287
00:20:02,153 --> 00:20:03,731
And who is the woman with you?

288
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:04,895
She is just my friend

289
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:07,270
I'm sorry to ask you but can you trust her?

290
00:20:08,052 --> 00:20:10,067
Do you think she is the spy?

291
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:15,692
No no..just.. I hear there is a woman on the train

292
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,856
Woman?

293
00:20:16,989 --> 00:20:17,536
Yes

294
00:20:43,497 --> 00:20:45,880

Let's go

296
00:20:48,888 --> 00:20:50,692
Oh, Do you carry your bag again?

297
00:20:50,841 --> 00:20:51,239
Yes

298
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:53,770
I'm sure there are important things in your bag

299
00:20:53,911 --> 00:20:54,661
Kind of

300
00:21:01,114 --> 00:21:03,278
I will go to buffet

301
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:04,583
Can you take care of this?

302
00:21:04,817 --> 00:21:05,294
Sure

303
00:21:05,661 --> 00:21:06,099
Leave it to you

304
00:21:06,145 --> 00:21:07,427
Yes, Enjoy your meal

305
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:23,513
We are arriving at Uwana in 3 mins

306
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:28,513
The exit is on the front door

307
00:22:08,903 --> 00:22:10,427
Uwana

308
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:12,184
Uwana

309
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,817
It won't come that easy.

310
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,489
Can you give me it?

311
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:37,442
Or We can go to police together

312
00:22:37,528 --> 00:22:39,114
You will be arrested for theft

313
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,629
Which way you prefer?

314
00:22:43,809 --> 00:22:44,981
Who are you?

315
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,028
I'm not from Daiinippon Electric

316
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:50,911
Mr. Kuronuma, Managing Director of Taiyo Electric, scolded me a lot.

317
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:52,247
Please give my regard to Mr.Kuronuma

318
00:22:57,817 --> 00:22:58,497
Hey you

319
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:00,286
Do you want to help my work?

320
00:23:01,778 --> 00:23:04,302
I'll pay twice your current salary

321
00:23:05,442 --> 00:23:06,794
What work is it?

322
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:10,575
A man has posted a house maid job opening in the newspaper.

323
00:23:11,841 --> 00:23:13,966
You work as house maid at his house

324
00:23:14,655 --> 00:23:20,240
And you report me his behavior, custom,habit,secret, something like that

325
00:23:21,873 --> 00:23:23,397
I will be a spy's partner?

326
00:23:23,842 --> 00:23:24,889
It seems little interesting to me

327
00:23:28,873 --> 00:23:31,819
I think it's fun to be thrilled and make money

328
00:23:32,709 --> 00:23:33,912
so you want to try?

329
00:23:35,647 --> 00:23:36,647
Let me see

330
00:23:37,108 --> 00:23:39,280
I think I am about to quit this work

331
00:23:39,827 --> 00:23:42,256
Are you sure you will pay me twice my current salary?

332
00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:46,014
Depends on the job, I will pay 3 times or 4 times

333
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:50,460
Who is the man?

334
00:23:52,577 --> 00:23:55,561
He is Kuronuma, managing director of Taiyo Electric.

335
00:23:58,592 --> 00:24:01,803
You did stupid, Shindo

336
00:24:02,928 --> 00:24:05,710
You shouldn't have missed the chance

337
00:24:06,475 --> 00:24:06,975
Sorry

338
00:24:07,991 --> 00:24:10,421
And you didn't see his face

339
00:24:11,163 --> 00:24:12,913
What the hell you did?

340
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,889
I'm sorry

341
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:18,358
You are no use

342
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:22,124
He said he was scold by me?

343
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,835
Yes he said that

344
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:30,366
But I have no idea who is he

345
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:36,030
Yes

346
00:24:36,499 --> 00:24:38,866
There is a call for you.
He never say who is he

347
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:42,342
He said he has something urgent business with you. What can I do?

348
00:24:43,202 --> 00:24:44,999
It seems he is that man

349
00:24:46,178 --> 00:24:47,053
Connect me

350
00:24:51,538 --> 00:24:52,280
Hello?

351
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:53,788
Hello?

352
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:57,796
Hello?

353
00:24:58,655 --> 00:24:59,303
Hello?

354
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:00,944
Hello?

355
00:25:01,717 --> 00:25:02,374
Hello?

356
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:04,006
Hello?

357
00:25:04,926 --> 00:25:05,459
Hello?

358
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,771
Are you Kuronuma, managing director?

359
00:25:11,014 --> 00:25:13,397
I wanted to call you

360
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,264
You want to know my name?

361
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,217
I don't need to tell you

362
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,202
Kuronuma-san

363
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:22,436
You missed to steel the secret of Dainippon electric

364
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:24,631
I did something trick

365
00:25:25,725 --> 00:25:26,311
You

366
00:25:27,303 --> 00:25:27,819
You

367
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:29,999
How much you need?

368
00:25:30,842 --> 00:25:32,155
Don't say stupid things

369
00:25:32,967 --> 00:25:35,499
I have a grudge against you

370
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:38,225
I'll tell you the detail later

371
00:25:40,616 --> 00:25:43,327
But you don't have any idea hearing his voice?

372
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:44,897
What the hell you did

373
00:25:45,413 --> 00:25:48,280
I didn't think it was a fake phone call on the train

374
00:25:49,022 --> 00:25:49,905
That's an excuse!

375
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:53,342
It ’s a huge loss to our company.

376
00:25:53,717 --> 00:25:54,967
I know..but...

377
00:25:55,381 --> 00:25:56,842
I have already applied for the patent

378
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:58,631
That is no use

379
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,428
They apply for a patent in a similar way

380
00:26:06,592 --> 00:26:08,350
Hello?  this is president office

381
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:11,327
Wait, do not hang the phone

382
00:26:11,952 --> 00:26:14,796
He wants to talk to you about that document he has stolen

383
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:15,288
What?

384
00:26:16,287 --> 00:26:16,826
Record it

385
00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:17,452
Sure

386
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:28,741
Hello?

387
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:31,397
I am the Naomune

388
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:32,366
Who is it?

389
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:36,905
I'm busy so please talk briefly

390
00:26:38,022 --> 00:26:39,428
Then what do you want?

391
00:26:41,061 --> 00:26:43,710
It ’s the matter you ’re talking about right now.

392
00:26:44,374 --> 00:26:46,327
Don't pretend you don't know

393
00:26:47,108 --> 00:26:49,194
I know you are in president office at 5 floor

394
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:53,811
See?
Mr. Tomura, the secretary chief, stands in front of you with anxiety.

395
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:57,803
Don't make a joke

396
00:26:58,405 --> 00:26:58,983
What do you want?

397
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:02,217
Please calm down, President

398
00:27:03,335 --> 00:27:06,756
I recovered the stolen documents from a Taiyo electric spy

399
00:27:06,975 --> 00:27:08,374
Don't be panicking

400
00:27:09,342 --> 00:27:11,092
If you get excited, your blood pressure will rise.

401
00:27:13,069 --> 00:27:16,030
You made a good idea..electronic thermos

402
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:21,944
It is good that the water in the pot gets hot or cold with one semiconductor thermoelement.

403
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:25,171
I will buy it when it is completed

404
00:27:25,983 --> 00:27:27,905
Then, what do you want?

405
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,585
Don't hurry

406
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:35,139
I'm going to return the document

407
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:37,538
It's ok if you don't need it

408
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:41,288
There are many companies that wants the document

409
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:43,624
Who are you anyway?

410
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,202
Anyway let's meet

411
00:27:47,053 --> 00:27:47,842
That's fine

412
00:27:48,693 --> 00:27:50,858
But just you and me

413
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:52,842
That's not good

414
00:27:53,561 --> 00:27:56,733
I can't meet strangers alone

415
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:59,991
Of course, it's ok if you bring Tomura cheif

416
00:28:02,897 --> 00:28:05,897
Ok then let me know the place and time

417
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:08,084
How about 10

418
00:28:08,631 --> 00:28:09,366
I don't care where it is

419
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:15,147
I'll meet you at Ashiya at 10:00.

420
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:18,522
Ashiya? Where about Ashiya?

421
00:28:20,975 --> 00:28:22,795
I will visit your secret lover's place

422
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:24,038
What?

423
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,116
Is that Ok with you?

424
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:28,350
I get it

425
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:30,233
I'll wait for you

426
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,975
And I know you record this

427
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:37,428
You should erase the last part I said

428
00:28:42,069 --> 00:28:44,061
President This is obviously a threat

429
00:28:44,686 --> 00:28:46,077
Shall I contact the police?

430
00:28:46,764 --> 00:28:48,967
Not yet, I will meet him

431
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:54,186
But I wonder who is he.. he know about Ashiya's...

432
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:59,202
You should erase the last part I said

433
00:29:04,116 --> 00:29:06,295
He makes fun of us

434
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,881
President

435
00:29:08,616 --> 00:29:10,655
We are looked down on

436
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,592
Papa

437
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,592
What would you like to give to your customers?

438
00:29:14,741 --> 00:29:16,483
Don't worry about him

439
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,139
Please go away

440
00:29:23,381 --> 00:29:24,272
He is coming

441
00:29:33,475 --> 00:29:34,569
Thanks for talking with me just before

442
00:29:36,045 --> 00:29:37,374
Take your seat

443
00:29:37,795 --> 00:29:38,272
Thanks

444
00:29:45,709 --> 00:29:46,616
Oh you!

445
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,678
Did you remember? Tomura cheif

446
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,139
You are Katayanagi,right?

447
00:29:55,725 --> 00:29:56,358
Yes I am

448
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,842
I was fired from my job three years ago.

449
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:03,506
 hear you've risen to the rank of section chief. Congratulations.

450
00:30:03,717 --> 00:30:05,045
Were you our employee?

451
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:09,608
Yes, The man in that micro TV spy case

452
00:30:10,068 --> 00:30:11,381
I fired him at that time

453
00:30:11,522 --> 00:30:14,436
President, I had a grudge against the company at that time

454
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:17,178
I wasn't going to spy

455
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:19,319
I know it's too late to say it

456
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,475
But Thankfully I became an industrial spy

457
00:30:24,842 --> 00:30:26,428
So What do you want?

458
00:30:27,139 --> 00:30:30,850
Madam, Can you serve me a cold drink?

459
00:30:41,623 --> 00:30:44,030
I can give you this at 3 million yen

460
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:45,538
3 million yen

461
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,952
You do some weird things.

462
00:30:49,788 --> 00:30:53,834
We had that document stolen by the people at Solar Electric on purpose

463
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:58,584
Everything was as planned but You broke our plan

464
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:04,319
You don't know because you're not an engineer so You don't understand what written in the document

465
00:31:05,475 --> 00:31:09,108
We pretend we are the worst

466
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,530
It doesn't help if you get it back

467
00:31:15,272 --> 00:31:18,014
You misunderstood that you became an industrial spy

468
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:20,647
You are not good enough

469
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:27,311
This document is the same as garbage.
You are lucky

470
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:33,045
Because If this document is true you will be arrested

471
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,944
But Why you wanted to meet me?

472
00:31:37,678 --> 00:31:39,163
I wanted to see your face

473
00:31:45,373 --> 00:31:46,420
Are you going home?

474
00:31:49,397 --> 00:31:49,983
Madam

475
00:31:51,655 --> 00:31:53,553
I will come here again

476
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,225
Then I'm leaving

477
00:32:44,819 --> 00:32:45,920
Were you OK?

478
00:32:47,202 --> 00:32:48,170
Don't worry

479
00:32:48,944 --> 00:32:51,428
But I hate violence

480
00:32:53,358 --> 00:32:55,819
He is a sneaky person

481
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:59,108
We should beat him

482
00:33:03,569 --> 00:33:04,350
Good evening

483
00:33:04,538 --> 00:33:05,373
Oh you!

484
00:33:06,107 --> 00:33:06,967
Why you came back?

485
00:33:06,992 --> 00:33:11,422
I didn't know you asked Yakuza to beat me

486
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,148
Yakuza?

487
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,367
What do you mean?

488
00:33:13,392 --> 00:33:15,476
Don't pretend you don't know.
That's the way you use

489
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:20,258
You really wanted this document,right?

490
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:24,180
I give it to you

491
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:30,719
I have a lot of copies of that document

492
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:33,094
There are convenient machines these days

493
00:33:34,609 --> 00:33:36,703
Please buy the documents anyway

494
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:39,687
Wait wait!

495
00:33:40,734 --> 00:33:41,797
So 3 million yen is enough?

496
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:44,156
I was violent

497
00:33:44,914 --> 00:33:46,617
How about plus 500000 yen?

498
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:49,547
Ok I give you 3500000 yen

499
00:33:50,351 --> 00:33:52,828
In return,Give me all the documents you copied.

500
00:33:53,273 --> 00:33:53,804
OK?

501
00:33:56,719 --> 00:33:57,672
What did you say?

502
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:02,508
You should apologize to me.
You used Yakuza

503
00:34:02,594 --> 00:34:06,305
You just want money, right?

504
00:34:07,461 --> 00:34:09,367
You are too selfish

505
00:34:10,101 --> 00:34:13,383
You guys still think I'm an employee of the Dainippon Electric.

506
00:34:14,258 --> 00:34:17,437
I was fired 3 years ago

507
00:34:17,508 --> 00:34:19,898
Ok OK Katayanagi-kun

508
00:34:20,555 --> 00:34:23,828
You won, there were many misunderstanding

509
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:25,484
We should forget everything

510
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:29,015
Don't be familiar and say my name

511
00:34:29,664 --> 00:34:32,055
You should call me Katayanagi-san

512
00:34:32,883 --> 00:34:33,484
Do you think so?

513
00:34:34,687 --> 00:34:38,289
I don't force to sell this.
You want this, so I sell

514
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,609
You should beg me to get this

515
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:43,805
You are right, We are sorry

516
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,101
Please fix your mood.
Please give me it

517
00:34:54,734 --> 00:34:57,015
I'm not going to be mean

518
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,414
Madam

519
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,344
Please give me a piece of paper and a pen

520
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:03,867
What are you going to do?

521
00:35:04,437 --> 00:35:07,414
I need you to write a note for me.

522
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:11,570
Please write that you are not threatened by this transaction

523
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:14,719
Because Mr. Tomura may tell the police

524
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,344
Thank you

525
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,071
Please write it

526
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:21,625
Please

527
00:35:26,266 --> 00:35:27,266
What should I write?

528
00:35:27,602 --> 00:35:28,477
Let me see...

529
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:31,422
written oath

530
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,367
About our important documents

531
00:35:40,008 --> 00:35:42,828
Thanks to you, I've recovered it.

532
00:35:45,032 --> 00:35:49,188
I will give you 3.5 million yen as a reward

533
00:35:56,835 --> 00:36:04,211
( Singing)

534
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,907
Lalalalalala

535
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:46,555
Lalalalalala

536
00:36:54,266 --> 00:36:55,039
Oh

537
00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:56,821
You have nice figure

538
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,078
I'm shy

539
00:36:58,414 --> 00:36:59,969
Would you like to go to see a movies next Sunday?

540
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:03,032
Your wife will scold me if I go with you

541
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:04,562
She won't know

542
00:37:04,696 --> 00:37:05,680
But...

543
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:10,476
So Let's go

544
00:37:10,774 --> 00:37:11,789
I'm shy

545
00:37:11,814 --> 00:37:12,422
It's ok

546
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:13,430
I will be in trouble

547
00:37:44,532 --> 00:37:45,555
Well.. I don't know

548
00:37:45,711 --> 00:37:48,102
He's very secretive.

549
00:37:48,219 --> 00:37:49,375
Did you ask his driver?

550
00:37:49,492 --> 00:37:51,321
He's very tight-lipped.

551
00:37:53,094 --> 00:37:53,782
By the way

552
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:56,313
Does the husband like you?

553
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:58,211
Well.. I don't know

554
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,407
Try to seduce him

555
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,438
I don't like such a old man

556
00:38:01,711 --> 00:38:02,852
He is still active

557
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,907
But there are stains on his face

558
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:10,492
His son is more interested in me than The husband

559
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,211
Is that college student?

560
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:15,367
Yes, he is very nice

561
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:18,149
He is not smart but

562
00:38:18,617 --> 00:38:20,305
It's like his father's opposition

563
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,367
Anyway Did you take a picture of the visitor?

564
00:38:22,899 --> 00:38:23,407
Yes

565
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:27,351
It was hard to take the pic

566
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:30,180
It's a little out of focus

567
00:38:51,133 --> 00:38:51,750
Who is this woman?

568
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:54,055
I think she is an employee of the company

569
00:38:55,078 --> 00:38:55,758
Does she sometime come?

570
00:38:55,953 --> 00:38:56,812
She has just come once

571
00:38:57,391 --> 00:38:59,492
She came for company's business last time

572
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:04,922
Do you know her?

573
00:39:06,617 --> 00:39:08,735
Let me know when she comes next time

574
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:09,610
Um

575
00:39:12,664 --> 00:39:13,407
This is reward for you

576
00:39:26,532 --> 00:39:28,961
Do you know the other party's information?

577
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,571
We are trying to do but...

578
00:39:35,305 --> 00:39:38,789
Currently, Taiyo, Kowa,and We are the top maker

579
00:39:39,258 --> 00:39:44,016
We have to sell a cheap refrigerator to win this competition

580
00:39:44,586 --> 00:39:47,750
You,What is our laboratory doing so far?

581
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,188
Yes

582
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,610
Who are you?
Why you enter without permission/

583
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:58,407
President, you can use me

584
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:04,407
Mr. Tomura does not know the information of Taiyo Electric

585
00:40:11,594 --> 00:40:13,711
I can get it for sure

586
00:40:14,071 --> 00:40:16,930
It costs a lot but good shopping

587
00:40:17,446 --> 00:40:18,649
We can't trust you

588
00:40:19,727 --> 00:40:20,461
You can't trust me?

589
00:40:21,594 --> 00:40:22,407
Why?

590
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:26,102
I got the electronic thermos documents back

591
00:40:26,961 --> 00:40:28,391
3 years ago

592
00:40:30,805 --> 00:40:32,563
You sold our secret

593
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:40,157
You don't know why I became an industrial Spy

594
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:44,859
President

595
00:40:46,031 --> 00:40:49,758
I was fooled by Taiyo electric and this company got fired

596
00:40:50,523 --> 00:40:55,398
Taiyo electric broke my future and dream

597
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:58,117
I wanted money

598
00:40:59,391 --> 00:41:00,969
To take revenge on them

599
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:04,461
I trained industrial spy for 3 years

600
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:09,562
I am aiming for Managing Director Kuronuma of Taiyo Electric

601
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:12,984
I want to beat him

602
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:18,797
I want revenge on him, and I want him to regret it.

603
00:41:21,054 --> 00:41:21,562
President

604
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:23,398
I hope you understand

605
00:41:28,476 --> 00:41:29,155
What do you think?

606
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,976
Will you leave it to me?

607
00:41:34,422 --> 00:41:35,227
I'll leave it to you

608
00:41:36,406 --> 00:41:37,312
President

609
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:39,250
How much you want for this job?

610
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,273
Well.. I want 5 million yen

611
00:41:56,922 --> 00:41:58,922
I want to see Mr.Kuronuma

612
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:05,711
What can I do for you?

613
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:12,148
I want to talk to him about some important news about your company's labor union.

614
00:42:12,173 --> 00:42:13,117
Please wait a min

615
00:42:57,641 --> 00:42:58,836
He will meet you

616
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:20,379
Please take your seat

617
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:32,043
I'm the Kuronuma.
What can I do for you?

618
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:35,700
Actually I'm from CIC

619
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:36,770
CIC?

620
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:40,989
As you may know,Related to the U.S. military

621
00:43:42,021 --> 00:43:46,517
My mission is to work in the Far East, especially in Japan

622
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,709
And information activities in the Middle East and the Soviet Union.

623
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,975
I got information about your company so I thought I'd let you know

624
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:58,600
I see.
Thank you for it

625
00:43:59,514 --> 00:44:00,662
Excuse me

626
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:17,193
Don't worry

627
00:44:18,623 --> 00:44:20,092
So what is it?

628
00:44:20,802 --> 00:44:23,247
Well..last year October

629
00:44:23,756 --> 00:44:28,896
3 people from your company went to Europe,right?

630
00:44:29,654 --> 00:44:31,334
Yes they went for 2 month

631
00:44:32,186 --> 00:44:36,053
Do you know who they met in Berlin then?

632
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:37,365
in Berlin?

633
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:37,982
Yes

634
00:44:38,764 --> 00:44:40,326
It ’s a place in West Berlin.

635
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:45,975
We know they met a key Communist Party executive

636
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:48,037
I see

637
00:44:49,764 --> 00:44:51,037
As you may know

638
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:57,865
The activities of the Communist Party's industrial spies are conducted in secret.

639
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:04,568
I think it will be a big problem for the union

640
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:05,889
I see

641
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:13,420
Around the end of this year

642
00:45:14,287 --> 00:45:18,341
We also pay attention to the fact that there are some delicate movements.

643
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:18,998
Hum

644
00:45:27,428 --> 00:45:27,873
Good

645
00:45:29,162 --> 00:45:29,787
I did good job

646
00:46:00,865 --> 00:46:01,389
Hello?

647
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:03,326
Oh,Mari

648
00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:05,201
Well, you know what

649
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:08,404
The woman in the photo you showed me came here

650
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:12,037
I see

651
00:46:13,678 --> 00:46:15,318
Ok I will go there soon

652
00:48:31,122 --> 00:48:32,200
I was not going to slap you

653
00:48:33,692 --> 00:48:35,669
But I couldn't help but slap you

654
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:40,840
These are the rewards you received from Mr. Kuronuma.

655
00:48:42,231 --> 00:48:45,278
A number of achievements as your industrial spy

656
00:48:46,106 --> 00:48:47,005
That's good

657
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,387
But

658
00:48:51,083 --> 00:48:55,294
Have you ever wondered how many people were sacrificed because of you?

659
00:48:57,669 --> 00:48:58,809
I'm one of them

660
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:01,825
But

661
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:04,872
I finally found out

662
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,801
I found someone who deceived me

663
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:12,286
It can't be helped if you resent me

664
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:14,958
But please listen to me

665
00:49:16,504 --> 00:49:17,074
What?

666
00:49:19,769 --> 00:49:23,340
I was just ordered by Kuronuma

667
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:28,590
I'm like a toy that is controlled by a remote control

668
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,144
Do you think you are not responsible?

669
00:49:31,723 --> 00:49:32,754
I think you are responsible

670
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:37,777
I didn't meat that I deceived you

671
00:49:40,793 --> 00:49:42,597
I was fired from the company because of you.

672
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:44,184
I broke my dream of becoming an engineer

673
00:49:45,746 --> 00:49:49,457
I was going to marry my favorite person and have a happy family

674
00:49:51,246 --> 00:49:52,551
Do you think you are not responsible?

675
00:49:54,230 --> 00:49:54,996
I feel sorry for that

676
00:49:55,801 --> 00:49:57,301
Do you think that's enough?

677
00:49:58,816 --> 00:50:01,059
Then what do you want?

678
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,684
I will make you pay for what you've done.

679
00:50:18,769 --> 00:50:22,441
I'm currently working on checking the electronic rate of Taiyo electric

680
00:50:24,332 --> 00:50:25,496
I'm in the same business as you.

681
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:29,426
I want you to support my business

682
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:33,269
You want me to work as spy?

683
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:33,934
Yes

684
00:50:35,207 --> 00:50:36,511
Please betray Kuronuma

685
00:50:42,434 --> 00:50:43,988
That is your reimbursement.

686
00:50:48,816 --> 00:50:49,894
Can you do that?

687
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:54,612
Immediately after I got fired from the company

688
00:51:55,636 --> 00:51:57,901
My mother got sick and died

689
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:00,964
I think she was shocked

690
00:52:02,745 --> 00:52:05,534
It was worthwhile for my mother to be an engineer

691
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,003
I feel sorry for her

692
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:15,096
Did you sleep with guys to do spy?

693
00:52:16,628 --> 00:52:17,698
I don't want to hear about it

694
00:52:18,776 --> 00:52:19,831
Do you have anyone you love?

695
00:52:22,768 --> 00:52:23,487
Kuronuma?

696
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:25,737
not him

697
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:27,245
Why you follow him?

698
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:29,784
Why you ask me that?

699
00:52:34,792 --> 00:52:35,721
You are still young

700
00:52:36,776 --> 00:52:37,737
You still have nice figure

701
00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:41,878
You shouldn't play with that old man

702
00:52:46,136 --> 00:52:49,511
Did you really love me at that time?

703
00:52:50,675 --> 00:52:51,307
Why not

704
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:52,917
I really mean it

705
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:56,940
What if I ask you love me?

706
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:02,081
I can't love you even if I trust you

707
00:53:08,112 --> 00:53:10,542
I will help your business

708
00:53:13,268 --> 00:53:15,675
You can try to trust me

709
00:53:18,447 --> 00:53:20,127
Ok, then I will tell you

710
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:26,214
I set up a small recorder under the table in the managing room of Taiyo Electric

711
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,971
Your job is to change the tape daily

712
00:53:34,589 --> 00:53:37,995
You trust me if I do that?

713
00:53:39,057 --> 00:53:40,330
Then love me?

714
00:53:44,995 --> 00:53:46,854
I need real love

715
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,026
Because I haven't got loved

716
00:54:17,849 --> 00:54:21,153
I want to quit my spy job

717
00:54:21,403 --> 00:54:21,919
What:"?

718
00:54:23,075 --> 00:54:23,708
Why?

719
00:54:24,763 --> 00:54:27,427
Because..I'll tell you the truth

720
00:54:28,255 --> 00:54:29,716
I fall in love with Mitsuo now

721
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:32,567
His son?

722
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:33,817
Yes

723
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:36,888
Because he is so passionate

724
00:54:37,685 --> 00:54:39,583
But I think carefully

725
00:54:39,786 --> 00:54:41,036
He is only son, right?

726
00:54:41,302 --> 00:54:44,575
If his husband dies, he will inherit all his fortune.

727
00:54:45,372 --> 00:54:47,060
That attract me

728
00:54:47,942 --> 00:54:49,997
He is little crazy but

729
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:51,099
very nice

730
00:54:51,396 --> 00:54:54,786
I wonder if you can marry him.
He won't approve it, I think

731
00:54:55,325 --> 00:54:56,950
Then we'll elope.

732
00:54:57,606 --> 00:55:00,271
He follows what I say

733
00:55:03,497 --> 00:55:04,661
Are you leaving now?

734
00:55:04,692 --> 00:55:06,309
Yes, I have something to do

735
00:55:08,692 --> 00:55:10,146
Call me sometime

736
00:55:11,106 --> 00:55:11,849
Okay

737
00:55:20,379 --> 00:55:21,473
Did you call me?

738
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:23,895
Can you call our manager?

739
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:24,747
Yes

740
00:55:32,528 --> 00:55:33,395
You recorded good

741
00:55:34,356 --> 00:55:34,817
Yes

742
00:55:36,473 --> 00:55:38,544
Did you replace it with a new tape?

743
00:55:40,122 --> 00:55:40,583
Yes

744
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:43,215
Thank you

745
00:55:43,544 --> 00:55:46,348
The manager went to the Hirakata factory

746
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:47,410
I see

747
00:55:48,106 --> 00:55:50,645
There is a board of directors from 3 o'clock

748
00:55:51,122 --> 00:55:51,879
You have 20 min left

749
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:52,715
I know

750
00:55:53,028 --> 00:55:54,028
Call Sakuma-kun

751
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:54,801
Yes

752
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:57,325
Sakuma is the technical manager,right?

753
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:10,653
You

754
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,317
What's going on with that patent?

755
00:56:14,762 --> 00:56:15,684
Tell me briefly

756
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:18,567
Why don't you apply for a patent early?

757
00:56:19,606 --> 00:56:22,051
I'm making some changes now.

758
00:56:22,551 --> 00:56:23,278
changes ?

759
00:56:24,645 --> 00:56:29,059
I thought it would be better to apply individually but collectively

760
00:56:29,598 --> 00:56:32,411
We are narrowing down the scope of patent applications

761
00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:35,239
Hmm..I think it's better

762
00:56:35,606 --> 00:56:38,934
I will apply for a patent after showing it to the managing director tomorrow

763
00:56:39,434 --> 00:56:40,926
Please do it

764
00:56:51,223 --> 00:56:54,208
The documents will be in the vault tomorrow.

765
00:56:59,926 --> 00:57:02,481
Once it gets in there, it ’s impossible to take it anymore.

766
00:57:04,575 --> 00:57:06,372
It's still in the tech department tonight

767
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:07,856
Yes

768
00:57:08,536 --> 00:57:09,801
Located in the locker of the tech department

769
00:57:10,786 --> 00:57:12,614
That locker is easy to open

770
00:57:13,169 --> 00:57:15,708
But the door is so tight that I can't enter the room

771
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,965
What floor is the tech department

772
00:57:18,473 --> 00:57:19,059
7F

773
00:57:19,958 --> 00:57:21,247
Just above the managing room

774
00:59:53,479 --> 00:59:54,205
Right away

775
01:00:26,398 --> 01:00:27,476
Why you helped me?

776
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,523
Suddenly I wanted to help you

777
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,398
That recording was a trap to lure you

778
01:00:39,741 --> 01:00:42,311
But I couldn't fool you till the end.

779
01:00:44,734 --> 01:00:45,476
What do you mean?

780
01:00:53,765 --> 01:00:54,922
You trapped me

781
01:00:57,515 --> 01:00:59,656
Why you suddenly changed attitude?

782
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:02,859
I'm a spy so

783
01:01:03,905 --> 01:01:05,905
I'm a spy so I'm not treated as a human

784
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:09,288
We are so miserable

785
01:01:11,397 --> 01:01:12,444
You sympathized with me

786
01:01:13,749 --> 01:01:14,249
I'm not

787
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:16,546
Then why?

788
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:18,898
I don't even know

789
01:01:20,163 --> 01:01:21,749
I couldn't help but doing it

790
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:32,765
I love you

791
01:01:34,788 --> 01:01:35,390
But

792
01:01:36,656 --> 01:01:38,109
I don't know how much I can trust you

793
01:01:38,437 --> 01:01:39,851
I don't like the thought

794
01:01:39,876 --> 01:01:40,702
I can't help but..

795
01:01:41,577 --> 01:01:43,773
I can't trust you even if I want to

796
01:01:53,281 --> 01:01:54,304
I can't love you?

797
01:01:56,945 --> 01:01:57,538
Reiko

798
01:01:58,320 --> 01:01:59,179
Proof me

799
01:01:59,952 --> 01:02:01,335
I want real love too

800
01:02:04,382 --> 01:02:05,772
What is this proof?

801
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:14,773
We can't trust each other

802
01:02:15,976 --> 01:02:16,679
Why?

803
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,320
We'll suspect each other.

804
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:23,523
We have become weird humans

805
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,890
You deserve it

806
01:02:30,343 --> 01:02:30,991
It might be so

807
01:02:32,616 --> 01:02:34,460
I wish if you trust me...

808
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:40,675
I always worry if you don't trust me for ever

809
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,656
I'm in a stupid situation

810
01:02:48,601 --> 01:02:49,937
Do you think that's okay?

811
01:02:50,437 --> 01:02:53,273
Please don't blame me anymore

812
01:03:18,562 --> 01:03:19,788
What would you like?

813
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,616
Mmm....yes

814
01:03:22,202 --> 01:03:22,850
Brandy

815
01:03:23,757 --> 01:03:24,226
Please prepare

816
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,023
Yes

817
01:03:29,757 --> 01:03:33,273
We met in an unusual place,Mr.Kuronuma

818
01:03:34,124 --> 01:03:35,663
There is something I want to talk with you

819
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,179
You are overconfident in yourself

820
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,148
The world isn't so easy.

821
01:03:51,195 --> 01:03:51,827
What are you talking about?

822
01:03:53,093 --> 01:03:53,624
Katayanagi-kun

823
01:03:54,648 --> 01:03:56,945
You don't have to hide

824
01:03:59,241 --> 01:04:00,335
I know what you work

825
01:04:01,913 --> 01:04:05,320
I hear You have a grudge against me about that incident three years ago

826
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,656
You got what you deserved in that case

827
01:04:11,054 --> 01:04:12,007
I think you are right

828
01:04:13,054 --> 01:04:13,991
But...

829
01:04:14,842 --> 01:04:20,452
I wanted to teach you the hard work of an industrial Spy

830
01:04:21,756 --> 01:04:23,233
Give up your idle hopes.

831
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:25,186
Think better because you are young

832
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,061
Am I still young?

833
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:29,491
Don't make me laugh

834
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:32,881
It's not right for you to speak so nicely.

835
01:04:34,694 --> 01:04:38,358
You treated a serious young man like garbage

836
01:04:39,623 --> 01:04:41,022
You are overconfident

837
01:04:41,623 --> 01:04:43,045
You won't win

838
01:04:45,155 --> 01:04:45,764
Why?

839
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:47,741
You have no organization

840
01:04:48,475 --> 01:04:51,913
You need money and organization to win as an industrial spy

841
01:04:54,053 --> 01:04:55,030
I can or not

842
01:04:56,827 --> 01:04:58,248
I just want to try it

843
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,678
You shouldn't go against me

844
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:07,123
In return, I'll buy your grudge with my money.

845
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:08,780
How much you want?

846
01:05:12,647 --> 01:05:17,975
Don't forget that I will not be bought off and Not affected by intimidation

847
01:05:19,155 --> 01:05:19,764
Excuse me

848
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:46,203
Oh!

849
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:10,736
Mistubo was scolded for our relationship

850
01:06:11,345 --> 01:06:14,126
I was so mad that I talked to him about running away from home.

851
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:16,189
But we don't have money

852
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:18,353
Do you want to borrow money from me?

853
01:06:19,064 --> 01:06:21,822
Yes if I say in short

854
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:33,361
You know what

855
01:06:34,392 --> 01:06:36,814
Please, 50000yen is enough

856
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:44,189
Wonderful

857
01:06:44,564 --> 01:06:46,197
You are so cool

858
01:06:46,697 --> 01:06:48,689
It's ok if I talk to the husband

859
01:06:48,908 --> 01:06:49,735
About us?

860
01:06:49,915 --> 01:06:51,908
You want to be with him,right?

861
01:06:52,431 --> 01:06:53,782
You are so good

862
01:06:53,962 --> 01:06:56,868
In exchange, you'll stay hidden until I can talk to him.

863
01:06:57,329 --> 01:06:58,048
You can go to around Shiharama

864
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:01,126
That's good. I take this

865
01:07:03,954 --> 01:07:05,533
You should leave tomorrow morning

866
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:07,197
Is is not good if I leave tonight?

867
01:07:07,298 --> 01:07:07,954
tomorrow morning

868
01:07:08,595 --> 01:07:09,954
Do you have any plans?

869
01:07:11,165 --> 01:07:13,103
I will tell you the details just before departure

870
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:23,759
Hi, Hello?

871
01:07:24,509 --> 01:07:25,079
Hello?

872
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,181
Are you managing director Kuronuma?

873
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:28,986
Yes I am

874
01:07:30,189 --> 01:07:30,806
Who are you?

875
01:07:31,572 --> 01:07:33,798
I kidnapped your son

876
01:07:34,728 --> 01:07:35,353
What?

877
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:40,986
Your company is applying for a patent for an electronic refrigerator, right?

878
01:07:42,111 --> 01:07:44,228
Please tell me the contents

879
01:07:47,642 --> 01:07:52,525
Your son may die if you contact the police or you refused

880
01:07:53,525 --> 01:07:55,564
Don't make fool of me

881
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:56,634
I'm serious

882
01:07:58,103 --> 01:07:59,079
I'll call you again

883
01:08:00,204 --> 01:08:01,579
I'll visit you next time

884
01:08:32,126 --> 01:08:32,657
Hello?

885
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:34,892
Oh you...

886
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:37,415
What? Mitsuo?

887
01:08:38,134 --> 01:08:39,790
He hasn't returned from school yet

888
01:08:40,509 --> 01:08:41,204
I see

889
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:43,486
Call me as soon as he got home

890
01:08:43,892 --> 01:08:46,212
What? well..nothing

891
01:08:47,564 --> 01:08:49,212
Is the house okay?

892
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,642
I'm in trouble

893
01:08:52,556 --> 01:08:54,423
House maid Mari is missing from morning

894
01:08:55,376 --> 01:08:57,345
What? Is she missing?

895
01:08:58,923 --> 01:09:00,892
Anyway I'll go home and talk with you

896
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:07,462
Hello?

897
01:09:08,493 --> 01:09:09,572
Please call the technical manager

898
01:09:43,454 --> 01:09:43,798
Hi

899
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:53,603
Did you call me?

900
01:09:53,845 --> 01:09:56,400
What time does the Patent Office close?

901
01:09:57,095 --> 01:09:58,829
Today is Saturday so it's until noon

902
01:09:59,236 --> 01:09:59,681
Ok

903
01:10:00,150 --> 01:10:00,923
Do you have anything to do?

904
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:02,923
I'm sorry but

905
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:08,970
Please write this data with random numbers and make another document

906
01:10:09,454 --> 01:10:09,806
What?

907
01:10:12,493 --> 01:10:13,751
another document...

908
01:10:26,126 --> 01:10:31,072
You can't release that document?

909
01:10:32,650 --> 01:10:34,587
Mitsuo's life is important

910
01:10:35,728 --> 01:10:36,782
Don't be panicking

911
01:10:37,517 --> 01:10:38,767
May be just a threat

912
01:10:39,626 --> 01:10:42,243
We don't know if he was really kidnapped

913
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:44,603
If we hurry, it will be as he planned

914
01:10:45,923 --> 01:10:47,837
I don't how important is the document but

915
01:10:48,704 --> 01:10:50,415
We have to save Mitsuo's life

916
01:10:51,181 --> 01:10:53,447
Everyone thinks so,right?

917
01:10:53,970 --> 01:10:55,478
You are just panicking

918
01:10:55,712 --> 01:10:56,486
You'd better calm down

919
01:10:56,751 --> 01:10:58,493
I'm serious for it

920
01:10:58,673 --> 01:11:01,657
He could be back home as if nothing had happened.

921
01:11:02,579 --> 01:11:06,126
He's a person who is familiar with the inside of the company

922
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:10,345
I should have applied for a patent sooner.
So there was no problem

923
01:11:11,822 --> 01:11:13,189
Why we were delay for apply?

924
01:11:13,853 --> 01:11:17,322
It was this afternoon when I received the document.

925
01:11:32,689 --> 01:11:33,447
An express mail?

926
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:51,767
This is hard

927
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:54,556
This is a car key

928
01:11:56,579 --> 01:11:57,954
Postmark is Nishinari station

929
01:12:17,142 --> 01:12:18,267
You should take some rest there

930
01:12:25,798 --> 01:12:26,915
Let's go

931
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:35,697
I think we should contact the police confidentially

932
01:12:36,548 --> 01:12:37,634
This is obviously a commercial kidnapping

933
01:12:38,033 --> 01:12:41,306
But Mitsuo's life is dangerous if it is reported in the media every day.

934
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:44,353
We can't handle this

935
01:12:46,455 --> 01:12:48,400
I know who does it.

936
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:50,673
Katayanagi?

937
01:12:50,698 --> 01:12:51,150
Yes

938
01:12:51,705 --> 01:12:54,353
Why don't you accuse him of the police?

939
01:12:56,173 --> 01:12:59,955
He's a man like a wounded beast

940
01:13:01,525 --> 01:13:03,267
He is a very dangerous man

941
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:23,072
Are you managing director Kuronuma?

942
01:13:23,876 --> 01:13:24,494
Yes I am

943
01:13:25,103 --> 01:13:27,017
I will teach you how to publish the documents

944
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:30,767
There is a TV transmitter in the company's laboratory.

945
01:13:32,236 --> 01:13:34,775
So please show the documents and broadcast

946
01:13:36,173 --> 01:13:36,837
Does it make sense?

947
01:13:37,283 --> 01:13:37,970
You

948
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,548
Don't make fun of us

949
01:13:42,205 --> 01:13:44,517
Please listen carefully without saying anything extra

950
01:13:45,962 --> 01:13:48,205
Broadcast at exactly 7 o'clock tonight

951
01:13:49,165 --> 01:13:51,353
The frequency is 190

952
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:53,556
Is that ok with you?

953
01:13:54,330 --> 01:13:55,212
Please make sure it

954
01:13:57,306 --> 01:13:58,408
Is that ok with you?

955
01:14:00,469 --> 01:14:02,626
Will my son be released if we broadcast it?

956
01:14:02,915 --> 01:14:03,720
Yes sure

957
01:14:04,626 --> 01:14:10,095
If you refuse, the newspaper will tell you that your son died in a car accident

958
01:14:11,173 --> 01:14:12,994
You are Katayanagi,right?

959
01:14:14,392 --> 01:14:16,126
I don't know such a name

960
01:14:16,744 --> 01:14:17,314
Hello?

961
01:14:24,095 --> 01:14:27,369
I understand.
Katayanagi is relates to Dainippon Electric

962
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:28,970
Target to Tomura

963
01:14:30,119 --> 01:14:32,939
If we follow him, we will know something

964
01:14:36,908 --> 01:14:38,142
I'm against for it

965
01:14:39,009 --> 01:14:42,580
Even if we broadcast false documents, they have engineers who can see right through them.

966
01:14:43,736 --> 01:14:46,595
I think Mitsuo's life is the most important

967
01:14:54,580 --> 01:14:57,009
I feel same with him

968
01:14:57,665 --> 01:14:59,447
But it ’s a problem if they get our patent.

969
01:15:29,869 --> 01:15:30,595
It's me

970
01:15:30,712 --> 01:15:31,751
Did you get ready?

971
01:15:32,150 --> 01:15:35,236
Did you adjust the video frequency as instructed?

972
01:15:35,775 --> 01:15:36,650
We are ready for it

973
01:15:38,290 --> 01:15:39,861
Did you prepare fake documents?

974
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:43,478
Forget stupid idea.
I am an engineer

975
01:15:44,189 --> 01:15:46,759
I can see the distinction between fake and genuine

976
01:15:47,033 --> 01:15:49,533
I won't say it many times, but please do as I say

977
01:15:50,001 --> 01:15:52,423
Or I'll kill Mitsuo-kun

978
01:15:52,900 --> 01:15:54,658
Ok, I promise you

979
01:15:55,548 --> 01:15:56,829
But there is a problem

980
01:15:57,626 --> 01:15:59,595
Cannot transmit at frequency 190

981
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:00,626
What?

982
01:16:01,744 --> 01:16:04,017
Our laboratory is UHF Broadcasting

983
01:16:04,705 --> 01:16:05,432
UHF?

984
01:16:06,392 --> 01:16:07,760
It's 770 megacycles

985
01:16:08,985 --> 01:16:10,149
There is only that way

986
01:16:10,346 --> 01:16:12,048
It's too late to say it

987
01:16:12,549 --> 01:16:12,971
But

988
01:16:14,455 --> 01:16:16,900
This is the only method currently available for broadcasting

989
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,353
Please accept this

990
01:16:21,939 --> 01:16:22,463
Hello?

991
01:16:23,361 --> 01:16:23,978
Hello?

992
01:16:25,517 --> 01:16:28,275
This is our last request

993
01:16:29,197 --> 01:16:31,439
Ok, then broadcast at 770 megacycles

994
01:16:35,103 --> 01:16:37,010
Why did you choose UHF broadcasting?

995
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,244
There are many obstacles around here

996
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,119
It can't be helped because of the reception area

997
01:16:46,142 --> 01:16:47,541
Attract him

998
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:49,478
And catch him

999
01:16:49,963 --> 01:16:50,830
There is only that way

1000
01:17:10,588 --> 01:17:12,783
Hello? Tomura has just left home

1001
01:17:14,635 --> 01:17:15,432
Good

1002
01:17:16,057 --> 01:17:17,393
Follow him without him noticing.

1003
01:17:56,518 --> 01:17:57,987
Katayanagi got in the car

1004
01:17:58,385 --> 01:17:59,674
He's also got a receiver.

1005
01:17:59,963 --> 01:18:00,869
I understand

1006
01:18:02,713 --> 01:18:03,776
Where are they going?

1007
01:18:05,768 --> 01:18:07,182
Heading to National Highway No. 1

1008
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:09,283
The car model is gray Gloria

1009
01:18:09,783 --> 01:18:11,190
I'm sure they go near the patent office

1010
01:18:25,182 --> 01:18:26,823
The antenna came out from Tomura's car

1011
01:18:27,307 --> 01:18:28,323
I'm sure they are the culprit

1012
01:18:28,698 --> 01:18:29,651
Ok, I get it

1013
01:18:33,401 --> 01:18:36,987
They have to go through a cement factory to get there

1014
01:18:37,994 --> 01:18:40,323
I think they'll pass there around 7 o'clock

1015
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:44,151
Listen to me,Catch the evidence there

1016
01:18:44,823 --> 01:18:46,112
The car model is gray Gloria

1017
01:18:54,651 --> 01:18:55,932
This is Shindo speaking

1018
01:18:56,557 --> 01:18:57,994
They deviated from National Highway No. 1

1019
01:18:58,955 --> 01:18:59,479
Yes

1020
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,315
They haven't noticed us yet

1021
01:19:03,057 --> 01:19:03,580
What?

1022
01:19:04,814 --> 01:19:07,853
I think they pass the cement factory at just 7 o'clock

1023
01:19:08,892 --> 01:19:10,150
Yes I got it

1024
01:19:30,510 --> 01:19:32,002
It's 3 min ago,Director

1025
01:19:33,096 --> 01:19:33,986
I know

1026
01:19:57,432 --> 01:19:58,268
It's 1 min ago

1027
01:20:02,548 --> 01:20:03,611
What shall we do?

1028
01:20:13,283 --> 01:20:14,526
Do you want to report real documents?

1029
01:20:45,088 --> 01:20:46,674
They are staying in a cement factory

1030
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:48,908
We are ready to catch them

1031
01:20:50,924 --> 01:20:54,010
Good,Break their receiver

1032
01:20:54,838 --> 01:20:55,612
We are ready

1033
01:20:56,541 --> 01:20:58,018
Good,Broadcast

1034
01:21:33,666 --> 01:21:34,237
Damn it!

1035
01:21:45,869 --> 01:21:46,424
Oh!

1036
01:21:48,752 --> 01:21:53,377
(Boxing commentary)

1037
01:22:22,651 --> 01:22:23,205
Director

1038
01:22:24,002 --> 01:22:24,721
Director

1039
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:26,096
This is Shindo

1040
01:22:26,908 --> 01:22:27,533
What happened?

1041
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,221
It didn't work

1042
01:22:29,283 --> 01:22:30,026
What?

1043
01:22:30,768 --> 01:22:32,940
They haven't received yet

1044
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:34,791
What the hell!

1045
01:22:54,018 --> 01:22:54,377
Hey

1046
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:55,049
What?

1047
01:22:55,979 --> 01:22:57,862
Oh that's it! It's there!

1048
01:22:58,057 --> 01:22:59,799
Oh my god, shit!

1049
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:12,604
Obviously a commercial kidnapping

1050
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,291
This is valuable research that our company has been conducting in secret.

1051
01:23:16,588 --> 01:23:18,268
That's true,This is valuable research

1052
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:19,869
I can't forgive that man

1053
01:23:20,963 --> 01:23:25,065
Our company's plan was useless for him alone

1054
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:27,010
Be sure to catch him

1055
01:23:27,674 --> 01:23:29,815
And who is the culprit you think?

1056
01:23:36,268 --> 01:23:36,823
It's Katayanagi

1057
01:23:37,854 --> 01:23:38,666
Shichiro Katayanagi

1058
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,580
But there is no proof of that, right?

1059
01:23:42,408 --> 01:23:42,979
There is

1060
01:23:43,924 --> 01:23:44,760
His voice

1061
01:23:45,705 --> 01:23:46,354
Bring the tape

1062
01:23:46,549 --> 01:23:46,979
Yes

1063
01:24:03,424 --> 01:24:04,041
Are you ready?

1064
01:24:04,502 --> 01:24:04,979
Yes

1065
01:24:53,994 --> 01:24:54,455
Excuse me

1066
01:24:55,229 --> 01:24:56,377
Is Togawa out now?

1067
01:24:56,877 --> 01:24:59,033
Mr. Togawa has returned to the Ise countryside

1068
01:24:59,448 --> 01:25:00,026
Ise?

1069
01:25:00,143 --> 01:25:02,463
He got on the limited express at 11:10

1070
01:25:03,009 --> 01:25:03,564
Thank you

1071
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:33,861
Why are you going home?

1072
01:25:35,361 --> 01:25:38,759
I'm going to think quietly alone

1073
01:25:41,126 --> 01:25:41,751
I see

1074
01:25:44,204 --> 01:25:45,181
You said to me before that

1075
01:25:46,556 --> 01:25:48,275
Your heart won't heal.

1076
01:25:49,884 --> 01:25:51,454
Don't leave it alone

1077
01:25:53,079 --> 01:25:54,689
Let's make an effort to get happiness together

1078
01:25:57,876 --> 01:25:59,095
Will you follow me?

1079
01:26:02,025 --> 01:26:03,486
We will be happy for sure

1080
01:26:04,814 --> 01:26:06,165
It's too late to say it

1081
01:26:07,689 --> 01:26:13,025
You've become stronger than I ever thought possible.

1082
01:26:14,345 --> 01:26:15,306
What do you mean?

1083
01:26:16,314 --> 01:26:17,697
Even if you say that you do not choose the means

1084
01:26:18,837 --> 01:26:20,251
It's not good to threaten with kidnapping

1085
01:26:20,587 --> 01:26:21,939
I swear I didn't kidnap him.

1086
01:26:22,837 --> 01:26:24,087
I don't mean that

1087
01:26:24,822 --> 01:26:27,079
It's not good to take advantage of a parent's love for their child.

1088
01:26:28,212 --> 01:26:30,689
It's too despicable, even for an industrial spy.

1089
01:26:31,204 --> 01:26:32,204
You are misunderstand me

1090
01:26:33,595 --> 01:26:35,189
We are victims

1091
01:26:36,681 --> 01:26:40,454
They treat us like animals while they make a profit.

1092
01:26:42,172 --> 01:26:45,352
Even if so,It ’s not good to hurt people

1093
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:51,259
You are the one who will eventually hurt

1094
01:26:53,782 --> 01:26:56,853
Do you still want to keep fighting?

1095
01:26:58,290 --> 01:26:59,790
Yes...well...

1096
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:04,376
I'll try

1097
01:27:10,376 --> 01:27:11,025
I see

1098
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:13,681
So I should say good bye

1099
01:27:18,009 --> 01:27:20,228
The voice of your threatening phone is recorded here

1100
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:23,032
I replaced it

1101
01:27:24,829 --> 01:27:28,884
I thought I'd send this tape to you when I got back to the countryside and felt calm

1102
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,017
It's better if I give it to you now

1103
01:27:36,470 --> 01:27:37,040
See you

1104
01:27:49,711 --> 01:27:50,273
See you

1105
01:27:51,211 --> 01:27:51,945
I won't see off you

1106
01:27:56,946 --> 01:27:57,587
Good bye

1107
01:28:44,867 --> 01:28:51,750
Finish

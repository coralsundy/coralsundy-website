2
00:00:38,797 --> 00:00:39,594
Boat man

3
00:00:40,578 --> 00:00:41,469
What?

4
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:44,680
that ship is stopped

5
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:55,156
It seems that the engine is broken, so we should help

6
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,157
let's get ready

7
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:22,586
Oh that's Ryujinmaru

8
00:01:23,485 --> 00:01:25,554
Is the boatman Mr. Sakai?

9
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:31,032
I heard that they are using that ship.

10
00:01:31,352 --> 00:01:33,305
But why are they here near Edo?

11
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:35,844
Maybe that ship was swept away from upstream.

12
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:38,828
If so, they are in danger of their lives

13
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,961
Are you safe?

14
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:51,226
Are you safe?

15
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:58,086
We're here to rescue you

16
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:05,218
there seems to be a little problem

17
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,812
You and me and...Senta

18
00:02:10,827 --> 00:02:13,351
Inosuke, we should go

19
00:02:13,898 --> 00:02:16,367
You guys wait in the ship

20
00:02:56,056 --> 00:02:57,759
Where are you?

21
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,783
No one here

22
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:20,916
Captain

23
00:03:21,893 --> 00:03:23,987
i didn't find anyone

24
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:25,893
I didn't either

25
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:32,424
We're here to rescue you

26
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:01,023
What's the hell?

27
00:04:03,773 --> 00:04:06,640
There

28
00:04:07,697 --> 00:04:14,297
Yuki no mosho / The Man Who Disappeared Yesterday (1964)

29
00:05:37,406 --> 00:05:38,492
Excuse me

30
00:05:46,299 --> 00:05:50,737
I heard there was something big

31
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:54,339
This is very big problem

32
00:05:54,956 --> 00:06:00,760
I've been working hard here for the last two or three years.

33
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,307
Gojodai might get married

34
00:06:07,057 --> 00:06:10,104
IS that big problem?

35
00:06:10,815 --> 00:06:20,432
There has been a lot of pressure against the government recently.

36
00:06:21,003 --> 00:06:25,870
the government is crumbling

37
00:06:26,674 --> 00:06:28,776
Nagasode can't do anything

38
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:36,440
The person is highly respected among them

39
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:40,620
he is very trustworthy

40
00:06:41,658 --> 00:06:46,963
you should understand him better

41
00:06:47,932 --> 00:06:51,604
you should advise him

42
00:06:52,354 --> 00:06:58,495
i understand his character

43
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:01,315
Oh I see

44
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:05,214
We should be careful

45
00:07:06,182 --> 00:07:08,823
he's been acting weird lately?

46
00:07:09,198 --> 00:07:10,167
What's wrong?

47
00:07:10,526 --> 00:07:13,112
he has insomnia

48
00:07:14,174 --> 00:07:18,221
he is helped every night by women

49
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:37,773
This is rice cake shop signboard but this is bad meaning

50
00:07:38,741 --> 00:07:41,768
However they are working very nice

51
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:45,542
Do you know why?

52
00:08:07,828 --> 00:08:09,595
I read Ankoro rice cake shop masuya

53
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,961
You won again

54
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:20,137
How about this?

55
00:08:21,847 --> 00:08:25,480
30RYO is gone from my room.

56
00:08:26,517 --> 00:08:31,857
Only three people entered my room.

57
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:38,345
I questioned those three.

58
00:08:39,446 --> 00:08:44,046
One said he didn't know they had that kind of money.

59
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:49,338
One said he lifted the safe when he cleaned it, but never opened the lid.

60
00:08:49,963 --> 00:09:02,027
One said the person who lifted the safe during the cleaning was in a hurry, so that person was the culprit.

61
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,823
Do you know who is the culprit?

62
00:09:08,093 --> 00:09:09,120
Kosho

63
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,654
You won again

64
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:14,649
How did you know?

65
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,153
You got three people together and said you ran out of money.

66
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,639
The kosho only know the how much is the money

67
00:09:28,496 --> 00:09:31,723
It is too easy for me

68
00:09:33,635 --> 00:09:34,628
So boring

69
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:48,181
Ichizen has more interesting story

70
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,113
Okata's?

71
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:57,296
He has an interesting crime-reasoning story.

72
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:22,148
Don't be humble.
I'll be your subordinate from today

73
00:10:26,054 --> 00:10:29,641
Their riddles are boring.

74
00:10:30,448 --> 00:10:33,361
But I want to solve the actual case myself.

75
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,243
I think Roju told you

76
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:39,846
I didn't know that but

77
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:44,068
Roju told me to introduce me one case

78
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:47,014
Do you have any complaints?

79
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,091
Well..nothing

80
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:55,037
That's good.
I'm going to solve the case starting today.

81
00:10:56,195 --> 00:10:58,108
You'll be police?

82
00:10:59,297 --> 00:11:01,870
I think this is good idea

83
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:05,893
I name my police name

84
00:11:07,155 --> 00:11:08,568
Sabae Shinnosuke

85
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:09,909
What do you think?

86
00:11:11,369 --> 00:11:13,449
Sabae Shinnosuke?

87
00:11:16,307 --> 00:11:22,427
Sabae is the name of the land where I was before I became a general.

88
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,844
Sabae Shinnosuke

89
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,263
I think this is good name

90
00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:33,215
So are you ready to work with me?

91
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:36,242
I get it

92
00:11:44,822 --> 00:11:46,035
Bring him to the room

93
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:54,423
I'll go soon so get ready for the crime

94
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,630
I worry about him

95
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:07,913
I worry something happen to him

96
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:12,210
We'll be punished

97
00:12:13,764 --> 00:12:19,750
Let's give him a simple case and get it over with quickly.

98
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,182
Find a safe case that anyone can solve.

99
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:35,235
Look for cases that are not too easy.

100
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,601
What's wrong?

101
00:13:17,609 --> 00:13:22,382
you don't understand me at all

102
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,511
By the way,Chuko

103
00:13:26,851 --> 00:13:27,578
Chuko?

104
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,970
You are Chuzaimon before Tadasuke

105
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,174
That is too good name

106
00:13:39,265 --> 00:13:43,504
Please make my name too

107
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,766
You are Ishigoro

108
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,600
Ishigoro?

109
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:53,183
You are just stone

110
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:59,728
Where's the house?

111
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,156
Where's the house?

112
00:14:05,237 --> 00:14:06,951
Oh we passed

113
00:14:08,152 --> 00:14:09,646
Get serious

114
00:14:17,322 --> 00:14:19,648
I'm SHoemon minoya

115
00:14:24,118 --> 00:14:27,591
Tekishita gonron did what work here?

116
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:33,579
he is usually very drunk

117
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:37,249
Who benefits most if Gonroku is killed?

118
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,083
What do you mean?

119
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:43,164
There is always a conflict of interest when people are killed.

120
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:46,717
GONROKU drowned and died.

121
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:48,996
We must investigate it

122
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:52,884
His cause of death has already been determined.

123
00:14:56,117 --> 00:15:01,611
We've already established that he died drunk.

124
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:08,384
The boatman may have been paid to testify.

125
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:17,152
Bring women who related with Gonroku

126
00:15:17,258 --> 00:15:18,098
Bring women?

127
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,469
Women are often involved in the case.

128
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:25,339
Gonroku was not into women

129
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,840
We must investigate it

130
00:15:29,837 --> 00:15:31,377
Come here

131
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:45,901
Please take care of them

132
00:16:24,796 --> 00:16:27,763
In short, anyone is fine

133
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:31,937
We will only match the results with him

134
00:16:31,962 --> 00:16:36,460
i don't want to follow him

135
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:39,007
I'll pay you

136
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:43,890
Women are often involved in the case.

137
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:49,804
It is women's fault that Shogun fell.

138
00:16:50,859 --> 00:16:55,319
beware of beautiful women

139
00:16:55,788 --> 00:17:01,335
Women are the ones who control the country.

140
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:04,728
Who's that?

141
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:14,814
She is the only woman related to GONROKU

142
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:23,740
It seems that you even leaned your waist

143
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:32,905
let us ask various people

144
00:17:33,987 --> 00:17:35,541
What are you going to do?

145
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:39,550
Me? let me see

146
00:17:55,383 --> 00:17:59,242
The Gonroku case has been re-investigated

147
00:17:59,688 --> 00:18:07,274
DAISHIN's son has come to like playing police

148
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:12,200
he said he wanted to solve the case himself

149
00:18:12,879 --> 00:18:17,747
It seems that they could not refuse his request

150
00:18:18,184 --> 00:18:22,051
That's why they gave him a case that had already been solved.

151
00:18:22,419 --> 00:18:26,262
they ask people to trick him

152
00:18:42,649 --> 00:18:43,305
Where's him?

153
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:45,727
Where's Gotoshin?

154
00:18:46,641 --> 00:18:48,602
He went there

155
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:04,611
sabae shinnosuke

156
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:08,783
shinnosuke

157
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:11,541
sabae shinnosuke

158
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:15,416
What's wrong?

159
00:19:18,064 --> 00:19:20,377
sabae shinnosuke has disappeared

160
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,713
we have to find him

161
00:20:12,731 --> 00:20:13,325
Did you find him?

162
00:20:13,403 --> 00:20:13,778
No

163
00:20:13,903 --> 00:20:15,114
He must be around here

164
00:20:43,857 --> 00:20:44,544
Who?

165
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,974
Oh Kaneshiro

166
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,865
Give me hot sake

167
00:20:49,341 --> 00:20:51,825
He's my old friend

168
00:21:01,729 --> 00:21:03,878
I'm Ohashi Kanehsiro

169
00:21:05,323 --> 00:21:07,221
I'm sabae shinnosuke

170
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,010
Are you from Hacchoubori?

171
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,706
why are you running away?

172
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:19,612
well

173
00:21:21,909 --> 00:21:25,417
do you play police now?

174
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:29,854
You like it?

175
00:21:30,893 --> 00:21:33,354
Today's first day

176
00:21:35,315 --> 00:21:40,471
Running away on the first day is still an amateur

177
00:21:41,096 --> 00:21:42,846
It could be

178
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:46,650
it's a silly story

179
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:47,792
Trust me

180
00:21:47,846 --> 00:21:52,588
It's strange that there's no one on the ship even though I'm buying food preparations

181
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,120
that's a ghost ship

182
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:59,510
I'm scared

183
00:22:04,393 --> 00:22:05,432
Minokichi

184
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,518
Something happened to Ryujinmaru's ship.

185
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:12,907
I told the story and no one believes me

186
00:22:12,971 --> 00:22:15,807
The ship is back today

187
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:17,502
What's the hell?

188
00:22:17,611 --> 00:22:21,353
All crew members were present

189
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:22,815
Are you sure?

190
00:22:23,276 --> 00:22:27,221
You are totally lair

191
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:44,007
this is a small hard fish

192
00:22:58,414 --> 00:22:59,641
Yummy

193
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:05,547
Shogun and daimyo does not know how tasty is this

194
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:35,926
UE heard you saying that this incident was all fake

195
00:23:38,184 --> 00:23:41,653
he got angry and disappeared

196
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:46,981
i forgot to shut them up

197
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,309
I'm sorry

198
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:53,067
I'm sorry too

199
00:23:54,793 --> 00:23:59,793
we have to look for curry by the end of the night

200
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:32,558
It's old here but you can rest

201
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,573
Here's good

202
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,933
Watch out your step

203
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,464
Thanks

204
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:49,251
Here's Kaneshiro's house

205
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:54,689
It's surprisingly comfortable to live here.

206
00:25:57,465 --> 00:26:00,683
You drunk too much

207
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:06,011
you don't seem normal

208
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,043
drunks are everywhere

209
00:26:08,551 --> 00:26:10,511
He's dead

210
00:26:25,766 --> 00:26:27,422
I know this guy, He was in Ikariya

211
00:26:27,696 --> 00:26:28,508
Minokichi?

212
00:26:30,461 --> 00:26:32,391
Hi,Senta

213
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,633
Are you back?

214
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,516
Can you come?

215
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:44,500
he dies instantly.
very skilled killer killed him

216
00:26:47,422 --> 00:26:49,797
What's wrong with him?

217
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:55,266
he wasn't killed here

218
00:26:56,821 --> 00:26:59,086
can you solve it by yourself?

219
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:01,907
why you think so?

220
00:27:03,071 --> 00:27:06,289
his wound is big but there is little blood

221
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:09,727
He was killed elsewhere and brought here

222
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:17,329
I think Kiku returned from Ikariya with him

223
00:27:18,164 --> 00:27:22,547
He was curious about Ryujinmaru and went to see it

224
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:27,602
we parted on the way

225
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:41,746
What Senkau did there?

226
00:28:41,771 --> 00:28:43,363
I washed the blood off my body

227
00:28:43,714 --> 00:28:44,527
blood ?

228
00:28:45,402 --> 00:28:49,113
I killed a stray dog on my way home

229
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:56,730
I am taking the dog home now because it was edible.

230
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:03,543
winter dogs are so delicious

231
00:29:04,738 --> 00:29:06,207
Why don't you try it too?

232
00:29:28,923 --> 00:29:32,235
why did he bring his corpse here?

233
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,845
he and i lived together.
He threw this corpse into this house by mistake.

234
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,026
Where is the riverbed where this grass grows

235
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:46,057
Ahead of Okawa

236
00:29:46,885 --> 00:29:49,057
I'm sure he was killed there

237
00:29:49,229 --> 00:29:50,627
Why do you think so?

238
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:56,096
this was in his clothes.
And he has a lot of grass on his body

239
00:29:57,206 --> 00:30:00,143
Watch the Ronin

240
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:01,932
Are you scared?

241
00:30:02,862 --> 00:30:04,292
You are coward

242
00:30:21,715 --> 00:30:28,715
The town of Edo is good for escaping, but bad for chasing.

243
00:30:55,375 --> 00:30:57,656
why did you do this?

244
00:30:58,172 --> 00:31:00,719
I thought it was not good to leave it down all the time

245
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:02,922
That is my job

246
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,219
Oh I forgot you are police

247
00:31:16,371 --> 00:31:18,519
Thanks for your work

248
00:31:22,972 --> 00:31:23,691
Who's he?

249
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:26,503
he's my friend and he lives here

250
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:27,956
how long has he been living here?

251
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:31,730
Since a month ago

252
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:32,917
Since a month ago?

253
00:31:40,502 --> 00:31:46,432
he has insomnia.
he hasn't been here for a month

254
00:31:59,344 --> 00:32:00,516
Thanks

255
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,461
It's hard to sleep at night

256
00:32:06,141 --> 00:32:07,250
I'm sorry

257
00:32:12,946 --> 00:32:15,032
Hey

258
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:21,344
You don't have insomnia.

259
00:32:26,507 --> 00:32:27,515
Where are you going?

260
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,523
I'm going to eat seafood rice bowl

261
00:32:30,241 --> 00:32:32,452
The owner of the shop was Minokichi's employer.

262
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:35,437
You are enthusiastic about last night's incident

263
00:32:35,757 --> 00:32:38,851
I am very concerned about that incident

264
00:32:39,187 --> 00:32:42,179
The owner is an old acquaintance

265
00:32:43,812 --> 00:32:47,218
he has one daughter

266
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,961
Ohashi is visiting you

267
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,950
Bring him to the room

268
00:33:58,263 --> 00:33:59,789
Here's ok

269
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:01,758
but

270
00:34:02,024 --> 00:34:03,864
Anywhere is fine with me

271
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,790
If it is not horse house

272
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,056
We don't have the horse house

273
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,640
But there's a noisy house

274
00:34:13,746 --> 00:34:15,099
He's my friend

275
00:34:24,441 --> 00:34:28,495
Hello everyone, I'm Sabai shinnosuke

276
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:32,322
He looks like Shogun

277
00:34:44,402 --> 00:34:45,209
Where's Kawachiya?

278
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,264
He just went to the division office.

279
00:34:47,797 --> 00:34:49,204
to the division office?

280
00:34:55,292 --> 00:35:00,059
I found this from his room while cleaning.

281
00:35:08,581 --> 00:35:13,755
I am solving a case. When I'm done, I'm going home.

282
00:35:14,273 --> 00:35:16,107
Don't do anything with me

283
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:24,239
MINOKICHI's body was given to KAWACHIYA

284
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,094
Sorry to disturb you

285
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,657
What's the hell?

286
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:53,343
Do you know who I am?

287
00:35:56,233 --> 00:35:57,860
Are you crazy?

288
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,554
You're insane

289
00:36:04,092 --> 00:36:07,298
Catch him!

290
00:36:19,587 --> 00:36:20,727
Boss

291
00:36:22,185 --> 00:36:29,580
MiNO was headstrong but compassionate.

292
00:36:30,145 --> 00:36:34,551
Even that noisy woman obeyed MINO.

293
00:36:35,879 --> 00:36:39,859
I'm a noisy woman so you didn't let me know he was dead?

294
00:36:40,182 --> 00:36:42,389
Boss told us not to tell you

295
00:36:42,441 --> 00:36:45,888
I believe our boss didn't tell you

296
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,735
It's not woman and kid's business

297
00:36:49,528 --> 00:36:53,268
Yes I am a woman and they are kids

298
00:36:55,688 --> 00:36:56,582
Taosaku

299
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:05,014
You told about Minokichi to the kids

300
00:37:05,584 --> 00:37:07,511
and you made them to help your work

301
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,331
I wanna ask you about the ghost ship Minokichi said

302
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:14,822
We stayed at Sumiyoshi ship

303
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:17,797
The four men in the Ryujin Maru were pale.

304
00:37:18,147 --> 00:37:21,653
That Ryujin Maru back in Edo safely

305
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,865
What is the ship's cargo?

306
00:37:23,332 --> 00:37:25,065
MINO's Lumber

307
00:37:29,907 --> 00:37:33,314
Teacher, I found him

308
00:37:33,973 --> 00:37:34,527
Where?

309
00:37:34,773 --> 00:37:35,753
Minoya

310
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:37,600
Minoya?

311
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:46,731
Just this?

312
00:37:47,082 --> 00:37:48,902
Not enough?

313
00:37:49,032 --> 00:37:50,399
I need 30 Ryo

314
00:37:51,034 --> 00:37:53,620
You just killed one boat man

315
00:37:55,598 --> 00:37:58,944
I am being chased by the police.

316
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,503
Someone saw my face

317
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:05,554
It's your fault

318
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:40,388
We must be vigilant.

319
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:44,581
We must kill all those we suspect.

320
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:51,418
Will you stop this weird game anymore?

321
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,827
weird game?

322
00:38:53,646 --> 00:38:59,906
It is not good to have victims other than MONO.

323
00:39:00,331 --> 00:39:03,978
What if he attacked me?

324
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:06,577
You know about Mino?

325
00:39:06,701 --> 00:39:08,761
I know nothing

326
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:09,869
Master

327
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:12,575
It took me three years to gather that amount of gunpowder.

328
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:18,312
We couldn't collect large quantities at a time because it would fool the officials.

329
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:24,146
It didn't take time If Kawachiya helped me because he has big ship

330
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:30,960
We must kill all those we suspect.

331
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:36,759
By the way, Takeuchi will leave from Tokyo

332
00:39:43,352 --> 00:39:46,985
Kawachiya is so upset

333
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:48,389
Yeah

334
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:51,757
What's wrong?

335
00:39:53,011 --> 00:39:56,731
I have a concern about my father.

336
00:39:58,962 --> 00:40:04,409
He was so kind before but not now

337
00:40:05,282 --> 00:40:06,095
Since when?

338
00:40:07,022 --> 00:40:08,428
3 years ago

339
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:14,165
Minokichi was killed about he doesn't wanna involve in that

340
00:40:14,894 --> 00:40:16,887
I suspect him

341
00:40:17,962 --> 00:40:21,435
But it’s hard to ask him

342
00:40:22,078 --> 00:40:24,971
Ronin or Minoya is suspected

343
00:40:28,003 --> 00:40:28,937
Teacher

344
00:40:29,987 --> 00:40:34,207
Takeuchi was here and doing something

345
00:40:34,411 --> 00:40:34,951
When?

346
00:40:35,237 --> 00:40:42,303
Just before. He said he was waiting at Ikaiya

347
00:40:58,835 --> 00:41:01,093
Sorry to have kept you wait

348
00:41:12,132 --> 00:41:12,984
who was he with?

349
00:41:13,578 --> 00:41:17,898
He was alone.
I was in the kitchen so I didn't know

350
00:41:26,187 --> 00:41:28,187
He didn’t steel money

351
00:41:28,437 --> 00:41:32,039
he was killed to keep his mouth shut

352
00:41:33,391 --> 00:41:34,383
But why

353
00:41:37,414 --> 00:41:42,930
I'm worried about the Sumiyoshi Maru's boatman controlling the officials.

354
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:50,219
The culprit thought he was the second most dangerous after Minori

355
00:41:50,797 --> 00:41:56,110
The criminal went to the safest place,Gotembacho location.
What do you think about this?

356
00:41:58,204 --> 00:41:58,915
so?

357
00:41:59,883 --> 00:42:02,836
I go to the Gotembacho location

358
00:42:03,266 --> 00:42:05,821
I'll let Kahei out of the place

359
00:42:06,352 --> 00:42:09,438
and take him to Mino

360
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,516
A more important culprit may be found

361
00:42:15,258 --> 00:42:17,493
You'll be in danger

362
00:42:18,211 --> 00:42:21,782
Kikou might be staying there

363
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,455
You can't find it without taking a risk

364
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:30,103
Not all the officials know my true identity.

365
00:42:33,955 --> 00:42:37,189
I mean I'm fake police

366
00:42:42,543 --> 00:42:45,590
That's strange

367
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:49,973
Kahei has already been released

368
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,480
Is Mr. Kawachiya his sponsor?

369
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:55,082
I asked a official in agent

370
00:42:57,848 --> 00:42:59,153
I'm not fake

371
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:01,528
Shall we go to the agent?

372
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:02,629
No thanks

373
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:08,098
I think someone picked him up before I came.

374
00:43:08,855 --> 00:43:10,027
Anyway thanks for your work

375
00:43:20,343 --> 00:43:22,812
He found you were fake?

376
00:43:24,906 --> 00:43:26,804
kahei wasn't there

377
00:43:30,804 --> 00:43:33,453
We were too late

378
00:43:34,554 --> 00:43:37,273
It will be more interesting

379
00:43:54,074 --> 00:43:55,152
Kahei

380
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:05,370
someone is provoking me

381
00:44:06,363 --> 00:44:07,917
He will be appeared soon

382
00:44:08,956 --> 00:44:11,972
I hope it takes big prey

383
00:44:25,027 --> 00:44:26,941
are you good at kendo?

384
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:28,519
Just little

385
00:44:29,941 --> 00:44:31,386
I worry

386
00:44:31,761 --> 00:44:33,839
are you good at kendo?

387
00:44:34,488 --> 00:44:35,222
Just little

388
00:44:36,495 --> 00:44:39,019
But better than you

389
00:44:41,574 --> 00:44:42,472
You're good

390
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:46,159
I'm not too good

391
00:45:21,533 --> 00:45:22,728
Official is coming

392
00:45:23,127 --> 00:45:23,970
Damn it

393
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:37,669
To nagoya?

394
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:41,035
I'll but something and back to Sakai

395
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,052
Then I'll go to Hirado

396
00:45:44,489 --> 00:45:50,997
shall we live peacefully here?

397
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:56,211
Don't worry.
The ship I'm on, Ryujinmaru, is very fast.

398
00:45:56,532 --> 00:45:57,407
Ryujinmaru?

399
00:45:58,493 --> 00:45:59,696
The ghost ship?

400
00:46:01,532 --> 00:46:02,883
Did you hear from Minokichi?

401
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:07,258
he was killed because he talks

402
00:46:07,657 --> 00:46:14,157
did you know why he was killed?
You were on the ship

403
00:46:15,016 --> 00:46:18,047
When I got home, I heard from a fellow shipmate

404
00:46:22,508 --> 00:46:23,594
This is for you

405
00:46:24,586 --> 00:46:25,461
10 Ryo

406
00:46:25,836 --> 00:46:27,773
It's not big money

407
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,750
I'm afraid something will happen to Edo

408
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:34,570
What do you mean?

409
00:46:34,984 --> 00:46:39,086
For example, fire or earthquake

410
00:46:39,828 --> 00:46:45,211
If a disaster happens, use that money and run away.

411
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:49,117
Just in case

412
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,516
Take care

413
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:56,250
Don't tell anyone about me

414
00:46:58,539 --> 00:46:59,523
Bros

415
00:47:07,195 --> 00:47:11,359
I think Minokichi's death has something to do with Ryujinmaru.

416
00:47:13,634 --> 00:47:18,220
Minokichi was talking about Deryujinmaru at Ikariya

417
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:23,767
That's what Minokichi said as a joke.

418
00:47:24,367 --> 00:47:28,047
He's good at joking

419
00:47:29,539 --> 00:47:35,734
While he was talking about it, SENTA told Ryujinmaru had returned.

420
00:47:36,867 --> 00:47:40,023
Minokichi went to check

421
00:47:40,632 --> 00:47:42,351
He was killed because of it

422
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:45,375
I can't believe it

423
00:47:45,586 --> 00:47:47,578
I be;live Takeuchi killed him

424
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:52,851
Takeuchi often go to Minoya.
Minoya use Ryujinmaru

425
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:54,140
so

426
00:47:54,328 --> 00:47:55,242
but

427
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:56,734
Shut up

428
00:48:02,286 --> 00:48:05,958
Takeuchi had 30 ryo when he was killed.

429
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,231
I think it's a big amount of money as a reward for killing Minokichi

430
00:48:11,395 --> 00:48:17,044
I think there was a reason for killing Minokichi

431
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:21,153
In short Ryujinmaru...

432
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:30,192
he must have had some secret

433
00:48:33,184 --> 00:48:33,747
I see

434
00:48:39,011 --> 00:48:44,644
Kahei thought that he would be killed next to Minokichi, so he escaped to prison.

435
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,902
But he was released by someone

436
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,535
Then Someone killed him

437
00:48:52,777 --> 00:48:57,433
Senta or Jurosuke will be killed next

438
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:07,800
We are closed

439
00:49:08,261 --> 00:49:10,331
Sis

440
00:49:19,824 --> 00:49:23,682
Bros

441
00:49:24,191 --> 00:49:26,660
What's wrong?

442
00:49:29,706 --> 00:49:31,425
Bros

443
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:35,339
What's wrong?

444
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:40,245
Bros

445
00:49:45,897 --> 00:49:51,639
I came here under the name of Takekoshi-san.

446
00:50:11,621 --> 00:50:15,136
Acquired 1300 guns

447
00:50:15,925 --> 00:50:19,105
Kanto type 300
Kansai type 300

448
00:50:20,175 --> 00:50:25,293
Let's invite DAIMYO who is dissatisfied with the current shogunate.

449
00:50:40,049 --> 00:50:45,401
As Shinnosuke said, I think MINOYA killed my brother.

450
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:49,651
Why you don't go there?

451
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,588
You aren't Samurai?

452
00:50:53,869 --> 00:50:59,143
Go to Minoya or go to police, why you don't act?

453
00:51:00,096 --> 00:51:01,229
What if we do that?

454
00:51:02,432 --> 00:51:05,463
You should attack them

455
00:51:05,697 --> 00:51:07,354
What if we do that?

456
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:15,751
There is something they are trying to protect even by killing people.

457
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:16,729
but

458
00:51:17,182 --> 00:51:17,963
shut up

459
00:51:21,971 --> 00:51:23,596
leave me alone

460
00:51:26,354 --> 00:51:29,127
He really look like Shogun

461
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:40,643
I don't think he will come back easily

462
00:51:41,705 --> 00:51:45,854
He said he would come back as soon as he solved the case.

463
00:51:46,455 --> 00:51:47,494
He will be safe

464
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:50,033
What do you mean?

465
00:51:50,494 --> 00:51:54,565
Our lord will arrive in Edo tomorrow.

466
00:51:55,377 --> 00:51:57,080
tomorrow.

467
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,494
If he doesn't come back by tomorrow, we will be punished.

468
00:52:18,979 --> 00:52:20,042
what are you looking at?

469
00:52:21,292 --> 00:52:24,003
This was owned by SEIKICHI who was killed

470
00:52:24,862 --> 00:52:28,432
I hope this gives some clue

471
00:52:34,161 --> 00:52:35,310
What's this?

472
00:52:35,661 --> 00:52:38,177
This is for Ju from Minoya

473
00:52:39,278 --> 00:52:43,403
So Seikichi got this code and went trip

474
00:52:44,021 --> 00:52:47,396
he talks things he shouldn't talk on the way

475
00:52:47,802 --> 00:52:48,700
Then he was killed

476
00:52:49,356 --> 00:52:49,989
Yeah

477
00:52:51,341 --> 00:52:54,653
what does this say?

478
00:52:54,716 --> 00:52:59,231
this is about the well

479
00:52:59,841 --> 00:53:02,685
about the well?

480
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:05,732
In short

481
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,513
innocent

482
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:23,513
This is going to be this

483
00:53:24,717 --> 00:53:27,803
no plan

484
00:53:29,209 --> 00:53:31,607
This is going to be this

485
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:37,334
let's decipher this

486
00:53:38,928 --> 00:53:40,428
This is going to be this

487
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,263
And next

488
00:53:52,115 --> 00:53:54,006
This is going to be well

489
00:53:56,388 --> 00:53:58,490
you have a special talent

490
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:01,935
I need more clue

491
00:54:04,888 --> 00:54:07,263
I wonder what Minoya is thinking about next

492
00:54:08,568 --> 00:54:12,420
Minoya is killing senta and Minosuke

493
00:54:15,771 --> 00:54:20,631
If they get killed their Kids will be in trouble

494
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:24,248
a lot of other people are in trouble

495
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:26,138
What are you going to do?

496
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:28,459
Search for RYUUJINMARU

497
00:54:28,693 --> 00:54:29,935
you can't

498
00:54:30,295 --> 00:54:36,834
RYUUJINMARU's sailors are not allowed to land and stay in the ship all the time.

499
00:54:37,896 --> 00:54:41,388
To solve the case, we have to board the ship.

500
00:54:44,918 --> 00:54:52,270
It's hard to say,i have to go home today

501
00:54:56,934 --> 00:55:03,582
Because I was with you, I came to understand your character well.

502
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:09,301
a special guest is coming to my house

503
00:55:10,395 --> 00:55:12,317
a special guest ?

504
00:55:16,297 --> 00:55:21,992
you have to welcome the guest?

505
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:26,110
Your house is going to be corrupt

506
00:55:26,711 --> 00:55:29,039
I have no idea

507
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,500
But I'll be in trouble

508
00:55:34,383 --> 00:55:35,383
It can't be helped

509
00:55:36,438 --> 00:55:37,274
so?

510
00:55:37,485 --> 00:55:38,422
i go alone

511
00:55:38,789 --> 00:55:39,563
you sure?

512
00:55:39,985 --> 00:55:46,110
I have save people's life. and I need to find some reason

513
00:55:46,946 --> 00:55:51,180
luckily i have no home

514
00:55:51,703 --> 00:55:55,836
when will you go to the ship?

515
00:55:56,414 --> 00:56:00,399
I will go when the night is coming

516
00:56:38,969 --> 00:56:40,367
Go ahead

517
00:56:41,531 --> 00:56:42,890
I won’t go

518
00:56:43,609 --> 00:56:45,148
You told me you went alone

519
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:46,750
You've changed your mind?

520
00:56:46,883 --> 00:56:48,297
Will you go ?

521
00:56:49,461 --> 00:56:50,539
are you okay to go alone?

522
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:51,851
It's better

523
00:59:11,304 --> 00:59:11,945
Hey

524
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,398
Kaneshiro

525
00:59:13,609 --> 00:59:14,890
What are you doing?

526
00:59:15,992 --> 00:59:20,461
I tried to solve this case myself because you don't act

527
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:22,875
You're stupid

528
00:59:23,789 --> 00:59:24,976
You should hide yourself

529
00:59:33,001 --> 00:59:33,748
Teacher

530
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:36,025
Oh you

531
00:59:36,589 --> 00:59:38,656
I wanna pay them back for my bros

532
00:59:39,131 --> 00:59:42,391
Get out from this ship as soon as possible

533
00:59:42,498 --> 00:59:44,505
Oh there is no boat

534
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,780
There is a boat I took

535
00:59:46,891 --> 00:59:48,657
Oh that's nice

536
00:59:49,186 --> 00:59:50,212
How about you?

537
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:51,628
I'll stay here

538
00:59:51,776 --> 00:59:54,749
I wanna be with you

539
00:59:54,784 --> 00:59:56,971
Don't act like kids

540
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:05,136
Kawachiya's daughter and cram teacher?

541
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,966
And there is another one

542
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:15,174
You should go back

543
01:00:17,310 --> 01:00:19,663
Bring Zenzaimon from Kawachiya

544
01:00:20,781 --> 01:00:23,634
Now we have a reason to rob Sumiyoshimaru.

545
01:01:20,167 --> 01:01:24,553
This is an ordinary well.

546
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:50,620
This works nice

547
01:02:17,432 --> 01:02:17,952
Hey

548
01:02:19,033 --> 01:02:24,560
Bring the Samurai here from DOJO.

549
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,663
Ryujimaru will depart with Sumiyoshimaru tonight

550
01:02:56,593 --> 01:02:57,720
Oh you

551
01:02:58,340 --> 01:02:59,080
Dad

552
01:02:59,464 --> 01:03:01,337
What's wrong?

553
01:03:37,426 --> 01:03:43,246
Kawachiya, you guys stay here to the death

554
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:48,160
Our Samurai surround you

555
01:03:49,193 --> 01:03:54,039
Kawachiya!You turned down my offer.

556
01:03:55,175 --> 01:04:01,462
Cram teacher supper Kawachiya to get us in trouble

557
01:04:03,837 --> 01:04:10,884
I'll give you a fire, but don't try to escape to use this

558
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:14,802
There's a lot of gunpowder here.

559
01:04:30,907 --> 01:04:31,994
Kaneshiro

560
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,274
Oh you are here

561
01:04:47,481 --> 01:04:50,914
I believed you were here

562
01:04:56,686 --> 01:04:59,652
I didn't know this was all gunpowder.

563
01:05:00,657 --> 01:05:05,030
There's a lot of gunpowder here.
I'm sure there are a lot of guns too

564
01:05:05,272 --> 01:05:07,892
Ryujimaru load the guns

565
01:05:08,248 --> 01:05:14,375
The crew told me they brought guns from Izu island

566
01:05:16,126 --> 01:05:20,633
So the ghost ship has some tricks up its sleeve.

567
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:26,698
Just before the four SUMIYOHI sailors were about to board, the RYUUJIN sailors all jumped overboard.

568
01:05:27,068 --> 01:05:28,581
So They made Ryujimaru like ghost ship

569
01:05:28,978 --> 01:05:30,158
I get it

570
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:34,289
They pretended to be empty

571
01:05:36,316 --> 01:05:39,349
The Shogunate has a bad reputation these days.

572
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,383
There are quite a few Daimyo who against at The Shogunate

573
01:05:47,155 --> 01:05:55,893
So Minoya tried to sell Guns to Daimyo for big money

574
01:05:58,580 --> 01:05:59,880
Yeah

575
01:06:00,604 --> 01:06:10,346
They told me the don't care who win or lose.
We just want money

576
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:18,405
Did MINOYA tell you that they have a lucrative offer for you?

577
01:06:19,977 --> 01:06:21,051
3 years ago

578
01:06:24,123 --> 01:06:26,076
They have held a grudge for three years.

579
01:06:29,943 --> 01:06:32,890
All is my fault

580
01:06:34,075 --> 01:06:37,335
I was wrong

581
01:06:39,645 --> 01:06:40,358
Dad

582
01:06:41,544 --> 01:06:49,690
I've only worked with MINOYA once, three years ago.

583
01:06:51,028 --> 01:06:57,488
But I felt guilty and disassociated myself from MINOYA.

584
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:06,408
But Minoya always ask me to lend my Sumiyoshimaru

585
01:07:07,342 --> 01:07:10,162
Minoya wants you to work with them

586
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:15,930
They often blackmail me

587
01:07:16,684 --> 01:07:25,344
I ignore them for my daughter

588
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,277
I put up with it

589
01:07:28,903 --> 01:07:29,523
Dad

590
01:07:30,935 --> 01:07:34,475
All is my fault, sorry

591
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,386
I was unaware of these conspiracies.

592
01:07:42,217 --> 01:07:45,430
They are so evil.
I can't forgive them

593
01:07:51,882 --> 01:07:57,395
I know Minoya is evil but there is more terrible guy

594
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:02,573
Shogun is the worst

595
01:08:03,745 --> 01:08:08,452
They don't get along with each other, and some take advantage of that.

596
01:08:11,576 --> 01:08:15,110
Shogun is ignorant. so stupid

597
01:08:15,483 --> 01:08:17,790
Yeah, Shogun is stupid

598
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,934
His associates are idiots too.

599
01:08:24,050 --> 01:08:30,337
They should talk more.

600
01:08:30,384 --> 01:08:34,337
Yoshimune is not stupid

601
01:08:34,975 --> 01:08:37,435
Are you close to him?

602
01:08:37,653 --> 01:08:43,207
He have to train more

603
01:08:44,815 --> 01:08:48,148
I definitely won't get angry

604
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:53,789
You are not shogun.
You don't have to get angry

605
01:08:57,495 --> 01:08:58,789
Yeah

606
01:09:01,770 --> 01:09:06,677
Ok now we have to think about how to escape from here

607
01:09:07,203 --> 01:09:07,917
Yeah

608
01:09:10,637 --> 01:09:15,110
I wonder how they bring those a lot of gunpowders

609
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:17,576
I'm sure there is another exit

610
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,340
Let’s take a look there

611
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:31,050
They will head to Amagi

612
01:10:31,391 --> 01:10:34,184
We will go to Oshima by Sumiyoshimaru

613
01:10:35,578 --> 01:10:40,411
We can dispose of DAIMYO, which is against the Shogunate.

614
01:10:45,183 --> 01:10:46,883
Whats should we do?

615
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:48,094
Let’s go out

616
01:10:48,568 --> 01:10:50,741
We can't

617
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,678
I have a good idea

618
01:11:09,483 --> 01:11:12,069
Ok watch out

619
01:12:23,139 --> 01:12:24,146
Who are you?

620
01:12:24,772 --> 01:12:25,712
I am a crook.

621
01:12:26,032 --> 01:12:26,712
crook?

622
01:13:01,201 --> 01:13:01,994
What's wrong?

623
01:13:02,019 --> 01:13:03,521
I'll help them

624
01:13:03,546 --> 01:13:04,898
You can't

625
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,218
Let me go

626
01:13:14,593 --> 01:13:16,253
Are you Chuko?

627
01:13:16,573 --> 01:13:17,393
Chuko?

628
01:13:18,781 --> 01:13:19,667
Who are you?

629
01:13:23,892 --> 01:13:25,965
This is a message for you?

630
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,357
I'm at Minoya

631
01:15:54,232 --> 01:15:55,125
There

632
01:16:05,919 --> 01:16:11,659
You guys must beat them!

633
01:16:26,526 --> 01:16:30,400
How are you,Chuko

634
01:16:31,765 --> 01:16:32,505
Good job

635
01:16:34,051 --> 01:16:35,631
I'll back in Minoya

636
01:16:36,192 --> 01:16:42,292
You can't.
We don't have time

637
01:16:42,988 --> 01:16:46,281
Please leave the rest to me

638
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:48,876
Please go home

639
01:17:16,836 --> 01:17:17,643
Stop here

640
01:17:36,970 --> 01:17:37,907
Kaneshiro

641
01:17:40,548 --> 01:17:44,774
Are you alright,Ue-sama?

642
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:01,494
Lord is coming

643
01:18:13,299 --> 01:18:13,932
Where's Ue-sama?

644
01:18:14,369 --> 01:18:15,619
he hasn't come back yet

645
01:18:16,393 --> 01:18:19,627
I heard he's being searched now.

646
01:18:20,478 --> 01:18:23,057
Because Mr. ECHIZEN taught him to play strange games

647
01:18:23,158 --> 01:18:26,955
If he doesn't come back on time, we will be punished.

648
01:18:26,980 --> 01:18:28,752
He won't forgive us

649
01:18:33,135 --> 01:18:35,658
Lord is coming soon

650
01:18:36,658 --> 01:18:37,799
What should we do?

651
01:18:38,275 --> 01:18:40,182
we have to die and apologize

652
01:18:41,916 --> 01:18:45,236
Are you ready to die?

653
01:18:46,658 --> 01:18:47,728
It can't be helped

654
01:18:55,010 --> 01:18:57,478
Ue-sama is back

655
01:18:57,503 --> 01:19:00,236
i was relieved to hear that

656
01:19:11,307 --> 01:19:12,432
Thank you

657
01:19:29,963 --> 01:19:34,174
What are you doing?
You guys get ready early

658
01:19:34,471 --> 01:19:35,447
Yes sir

659
01:20:03,419 --> 01:20:08,193
We welcome our lord

660
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:35,727
Oh..you

661
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:38,500
Sensei

662
01:20:42,219 --> 01:20:42,938
What? dainagon

663
01:20:43,445 --> 01:20:50,938
Your biological mother is related to Dainagon

664
01:20:52,079 --> 01:21:02,617
I've been worried about Kawachiya since three years ago.I wrote a letter to my sister saying that I could not rest assured about the life of my adopted daughter OSONO.

665
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:16,050
DAINAGON knew that.
He used a fake to go to the EDO first to check on the status of KAWACHIYA.

666
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:27,642
His sister objected, but he forced himself to come to EDO.

667
01:21:28,955 --> 01:21:34,455
Sister...Kaneshiro is cool

668
01:21:39,476 --> 01:21:40,765
everything is settle down

669
01:21:41,617 --> 01:21:47,336
Problems with the generals were also resolved through discussion.

670
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:51,810
Your house is very bad

671
01:21:52,161 --> 01:21:53,575
You too

672
01:22:02,463 --> 01:22:03,713
Look at that

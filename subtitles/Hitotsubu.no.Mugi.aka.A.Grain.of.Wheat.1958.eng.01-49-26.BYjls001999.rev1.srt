00:01:29,263 --> 00:01:36,231
Everyone, please take good care of yourselves and work hard

4
00:01:37,483 --> 00:01:42,239
After a long winter, everyone is now ready to
take a step forward in the work they have done

5
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:47,746
You have taken a step forward in your new life.

6
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,419
Please be careful

7
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:54,556
Don't forget your stuff.

8
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,119
Take care of your health.

9
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,817
Take care.

10
00:01:59,531 --> 00:02:01,164
Teacher.

11
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:03,906
Only Yuko Koizumi hasn't come yet

12
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,065
What's wrong?

13
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:16,884
With this I conclude my greetings.

14
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:20,650
Thank you very much.

15
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:30,805
A special train bound for Sendai from Ueno will arrive at platform 1

16
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,149
Everyone, please step back behind the line

17
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:38,990
The students are lined up here in a single row,

18
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,947
everyone is lined up?

19
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:46,194
Ok get on the train.

20
00:02:58,638 --> 00:02:59,945
Take care.

21
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,197
Mom.

22
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:09,602
Mom.

23
00:03:11,522 --> 00:03:12,802
Take care of your health.

24
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:13,715
You too.

25
00:03:14,432 --> 00:03:15,865
I'm counting on you

26
00:03:16,178 --> 00:03:18,172
Please send me some letters.

27
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:22,010
Do your best

28
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,936
yet, it's still cold.
Don't catch a cold

29
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:27,397
Please stay strong

30
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:28,781
Don't worry about us.

31
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,246
Do your best

32
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:33,410
Make sure to listen carefully to what the people over there are saying

33
00:03:34,303 --> 00:03:35,792
Excuse me, excuse me, I'm sorry

34
00:03:36,845 --> 00:03:38,005
Come on, hurry up

35
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,231
what's wrong?

36
00:03:46,418 --> 00:03:47,525
Teacher

37
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,495
I'm sorry to worry you, but I can go with everyone.

38
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:56,166
It was good that we went together

39
00:03:56,863 --> 00:03:59,863
I'm glad we made it.

40
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,870
Get on the train.

41
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:03,708
Thanks.

42
00:04:03,815 --> 00:04:05,595
Here it is.

43
00:04:06,432 --> 00:04:09,147
I made a bento, please serve it.

44
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:12,632
Thank you

45
00:04:12,983 --> 00:04:15,337
Inoue-sensei, and please take care not to catch a cold

46
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,515
Thank you in advance

47
00:04:22,907 --> 00:04:24,707
Ah, then we will be off.

48
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,834
Get back your seat.

49
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,079
Put your luggage

50
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:16,493
everyone remember the number, right?

51
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,128
Hurry up and sit down.

52
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:26,524
Everyone okay

53
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:29,608
From here on, these seats are for the people who will get on later

54
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,102
Make sure you don't go this way, okay?

55
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:40,344
starting today,

56
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,623
You have to take responsibility for your own actions,

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,847
We will arrive at Ueno Station at 6 o'clock

58
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:51,807
Everyone, make sure to sleep well. It's not good to be drowsy, right?

59
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:57,617
and then follow the instructions from Mr. Arishima from Public Employment Security Office

60
00:05:58,746 --> 00:06:01,746
As the teacher just mentioned, please make sure to get a good night's sleep

61
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,384
And if you have any questions about anything,

62
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,996
I will be with you all the time, so don't hold back.

63
00:06:07,021 --> 00:06:10,275
So please feel free to ask questions, okay?

64
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,103
Thank you in advance

65
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,067
How about you, Ryuko?

66
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,891
I'm fine

67
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,502
Sleep well

68
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:36,043
It feels like we're on a school trip for some reason

69
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:36,892
Yes.

70
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:39,122
Well, just try to relax and take it easy

71
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:42,970
Open the window.

72
00:06:42,995 --> 00:06:43,762
What's wrong?

73
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:46,374
The villagers are sending us off

74
00:07:17,029 --> 00:07:18,469
What's going on?

75
00:07:19,009 --> 00:07:20,415
Come on.

76
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,985
Get your seat.

77
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,086
Oh my god.

78
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,277
Hey, is it true that Ichiko-sensei made that?

79
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:34,318
Yes.

80
00:08:35,435 --> 00:08:37,195
Are you still awake?

81
00:08:38,554 --> 00:08:39,414
Wanna eat?

82
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,828
I want to eat, but I'm too full

83
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,655
What a shame, I'm going to sleep

84
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,005
Mr. Yamada

85
00:08:56,242 --> 00:08:58,742
We meet again.

86
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,566
I'm Onoda

87
00:09:03,466 --> 00:09:04,886
I’m sorry.

88
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:08,416
Oh, I heard that you are here.
Wanna drink?

89
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:09,641
I can't drink.

90
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,995
Hey come on

91
00:09:11,922 --> 00:09:14,748
We are having party there.

92
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,595
How many students?

93
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:18,549
30

94
00:09:19,628 --> 00:09:21,115
Ours are 60

95
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:26,875
Our entire province ,1,300 people.

96
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,351
That's a lot.

97
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:33,736
Next year there will be more people.

98
00:09:36,946 --> 00:09:42,265
I'm not a teacher, I'm more like a job referral agency.

99
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:46,854
I find myself spending more time on physical activities than standing at class room.

100
00:09:48,056 --> 00:09:50,006
It seems that our roles are tough for both of us

101
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:56,184
The kids in Tohoku will be welcome because they work hard.

102
00:10:00,123 --> 00:10:02,715
 How about coming over there and doing it together?

103
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,664
I'm fine.

104
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,257
Don't say that,

105
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,820
Ok then see you in Tokyo.

106
00:11:14,687 --> 00:11:16,314
I'll stop over there.

107
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:09,596
However, there is quite a bit of time before the next job

108
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,735
so please listen calmly

109
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:14,889
Thank you all for coming.

110
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,380
Please try to look towards the front as much as possible

111
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,212
Yes, everyone, please gather at the flag that has the same number as your chest number

112
00:12:26,406 --> 00:12:31,627
Yes, the person at 12, please come over here, the person at 12 is this way

113
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,055
Go to number 12, number 12, okay?

114
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,395
Alright everyone, please come forward and squat down

115
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,106
Thank you all for your hard work

116
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:48,700
My name is Mutou from job referral agency.

117
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,876
If you have any worries or need to talk,

118
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,017
feel free to come anytime

119
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,631
Now, I will take attendance

120
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,539
Minoru Obara and Tsugio Endo

121
00:13:04,212 --> 00:13:06,983
You will soon board the train, so wait here, okay?

122
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,126
Yuko, are you okay?

123
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,139
Tetsuo Yoshizawa

124
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:17,476
Yutaka Suzuki

125
00:13:19,268 --> 00:13:21,248
please line up here

126
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:26,509
Nobutaka Saito

127
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:36,220
Takuma Tsutomu, Koji Iwanaga, and Umeo Watanabe from Hirata Junior High

128
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:40,055
over here, over here, over here,

129
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:45,462
He's your master

130
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,182
I am Umeo Watanabe

131
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,482
Welcome

132
00:13:50,073 --> 00:13:51,497
He is our teacher

133
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,566
Thank you in advance

134
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,556
Are you the teacher?

135
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,794
Thank you for your hard work

136
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,430
I've been waiting for you

137
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,927
I'll take care of it

138
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:04,798
Please wait a moment

139
00:14:06,603 --> 00:14:07,785
I'll go first.

140
00:14:07,912 --> 00:14:11,179
Take care.

141
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:18,283
Teacher.

142
00:14:19,484 --> 00:14:20,266
This is Inoue.

143
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,766
Thanks for your hard work.

144
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,776
Please rest assured about her.

145
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,860
Please

146
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:26,869
Kayo.

147
00:14:33,118 --> 00:14:34,698
Work hard.

148
00:14:35,707 --> 00:14:37,204
then, goodbye

149
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:52,596
Look at that huge chimney!

150
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:54,330
There are four of them.

151
00:14:55,347 --> 00:14:57,147
that's the famous ghost chimney.

152
00:14:57,404 --> 00:14:59,544
What is a ghost chimney anyway?

153
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,712
Well, just take a look at that

154
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:04,068
Well, it's been 2 now

155
00:15:15,348 --> 00:15:16,381
Here it is.

156
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,097
welcome

157
00:15:29,867 --> 00:15:30,401
Mom.

158
00:15:32,322 --> 00:15:36,242
Come here quickly, this is the child

159
00:15:36,766 --> 00:15:38,739
welcome

160
00:15:40,109 --> 00:15:41,329
Take it easy.

161
00:15:41,628 --> 00:15:43,328
Have you just graduated from junior high school?

162
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,050
We are small

163
00:15:45,763 --> 00:15:47,512
This is your senior, Macchan.

164
00:15:47,954 --> 00:15:48,948
Thanks in advance.

165
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:49,819
What's your name?

166
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:51,198
Watanabe Muneo,right?

167
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:52,363
Yes.

168
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,016
You wrote it here yesterday,

169
00:15:54,123 --> 00:15:56,576
I know that.

170
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,129
Come in.

171
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,421
Have a meal here.

172
00:16:01,992 --> 00:16:03,665
You are still guest today

173
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,690
That's right,come over here

174
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,970
Bring some tea

175
00:16:09,109 --> 00:16:10,734
Come over here

176
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,853
Macchan and Umechan

177
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:14,984
My husband is Mr. Take, so The best of the best

178
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,505
That's right

179
00:16:16,819 --> 00:16:18,665
This is so great.

180
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,346
Absolutely, everyone is so great.

181
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:37,233
Welcome home.

182
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,236
What is this? you haven't cleaned it yet?

183
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,606
Hurry up and clean up

184
00:16:44,275 --> 00:16:45,488
this is so annoying

185
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,473
Come here.

186
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:53,952
I'm back now

187
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,707
Please greet him.

188
00:17:09,247 --> 00:17:11,765
You call him 'teacher'

189
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,457
Here's your room.

190
00:17:19,002 --> 00:17:20,935
I'm off to school.

191
00:17:21,366 --> 00:17:25,197
She's new worker.
Call them Obocchama.

192
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:26,174
Yes.

193
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,740
Hello

194
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,832
Ah, I'm home, dear.

195
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,627
Thank you for your hard work

196
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,078
He's your master.

197
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,493
I'm Tsuyoshi Nishiyama

198
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,817
Nice to meet you

199
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,680
Oh, you're quite solid, aren't you?

200
00:18:18,962 --> 00:18:21,037
Everyone come here

201
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,580
this is Nishiyama-kun, who has come
to join us a trainee starting today

202
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:36,478
Please get along with him.

203
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:37,705
Nice to meet you

204
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:41,090
Make sure to listen carefully to what everyone says and learn the job quickly

205
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:42,579
Take him to his room

206
00:18:51,165 --> 00:18:52,308
Wife

207
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,846
He's new trainee

208
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,609
I'm Tsuyoshi Nishiyama

209
00:19:00,357 --> 00:19:05,414
there's nothing we can do about
the increasing number of heads

210
00:19:09,008 --> 00:19:09,495
Don't worry about it

211
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:11,335
She's nice

212
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,362
This is your place

213
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,236
You come in here

214
00:19:33,343 --> 00:19:35,637
and you can use this desk

215
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,156
Well, you probably won't need to use it anyway

216
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:41,485
Which ship's factory?

217
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,946
Which ship's factory?

218
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:44,592
What do you mean?

219
00:19:45,611 --> 00:19:46,515
No way

220
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:48,463
We're in the auto repair business

221
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,469
Is everyone here?

222
00:19:57,819 --> 00:20:00,565
Then let's introduce ourselves one by one

223
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,926
so that he can remember our names

224
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:05,329
You go first.

225
00:20:05,725 --> 00:20:07,242
I'm Minoru Obara

226
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,693
Be polite

227
00:20:10,226 --> 00:20:12,136
I'm Minoru Obara

228
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:12,883
Next.

229
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:16,846
I am Endo Tsugio

230
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,952
I am Yoshioka Gonzo

231
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,216
I lived near you

232
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,453
Thanks for coming.

233
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,325
Let's eat first

234
00:20:27,972 --> 00:20:30,214
You guys must be starving

235
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,314
so just eat it.

236
00:20:37,374 --> 00:20:38,954
Thank you very much

237
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:44,273
Oh, It's red rice.

238
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,370
You like it.

239
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:48,752
it's the factory manager's heartfelt effort

240
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:51,447
This is the feudal aspect of this company.

241
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:52,992
It might be like that

242
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:02,738
Hey close the door. It's cold, isn't it?

243
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:14,677
I'm also busy and can't go out to greet you every time

244
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,471
But it's the first day,

245
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,292
and the children will feel lonely

246
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,420
It's not like I came to Tokyo just for sightseeing

247
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,526
They are at an age where they can feel lonely

248
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:29,399
Speaking of age16, that was the year when they went to the military as a young aviation soldier back in the day

249
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,784
Now we are also making glass here, you know

250
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:36,190
Even so, during the war, this place was bustling as a military supply factory

251
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,677
Well done.

252
00:23:28,998 --> 00:23:29,918
I'm off.

253
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,142
please, don't say that anymore.

254
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:39,072
Hey please serve us too

255
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:42,224
Are you jealous?

256
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,654
We are human too

257
00:23:47,743 --> 00:23:49,981
Can I borrow this for a moment?

258
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,396
please

259
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,389
thank you for your hard work, teachers

260
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,976
Well, I would like to ask for a good child again next year

261
00:24:00,007 --> 00:24:01,053
Same here.

262
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,755
I would also like to ask for a boy next year

263
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,920
in the Tohoku region have plenty of children, you see

264
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:11,652
There are a lot of kids out of work., so there's no need to worry

265
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,396
I can bring anyone along

266
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:18,571
If they work at our factory for three years, you will be able to properly get married and return home,

267
00:24:18,596 --> 00:24:21,596
so it would be helpful if you could also help arrange the marriage destination

268
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,005
Mr. Ogata

269
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:27,632
Stop it....

270
00:24:28,812 --> 00:24:29,705
What's the hell?

271
00:24:30,672 --> 00:24:32,608
Mind your mouth

272
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,403
you have no right to tell me

273
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:39,457
What's the hell?

274
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,536
Stop it....

275
00:24:50,129 --> 00:24:51,922
Bring some cakes?

276
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,865
How about some fruits?

277
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,890
It would be nice.

278
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,039
Are you off?

279
00:25:07,971 --> 00:25:09,078
Hold on.

280
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:12,521
Hold on.

281
00:25:12,807 --> 00:25:14,174
Get your hands off of me!

282
00:25:17,464 --> 00:25:19,270
Don't pretend you're cool

283
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:58,031
We are working hard every day

284
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:01,130
Minoru is a trainee

285
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:15,331
Tsugio is skilled with his hands
and is learning about tabletops

286
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:20,261
I am being taught electric welding

287
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,220
I heard that this senior is someone who hasn't even graduate junior high school.

288
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:30,027
I wear a mask to protect my eyes
from the welding

289
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:40,177
Please rest assured that we will work hard to become skilled craftsmen. Best regards, Gonzō Yoshioka

290
00:26:41,352 --> 00:26:44,352
This is a letter from Yoshioka who went to the ironworks

291
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,680
Next is a letter from Shiro and Makoto who went to the glass factory.

292
00:26:49,303 --> 00:26:50,103
I'll read them.

293
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,400
Both of them are working hard and doing well.

294
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,194
There are many glass factories in Tokyo, similar to the one we are working at

295
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,086
The inside of the factory is really hot,

296
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,346
but as you get used to the work,

297
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,616
I start to find it interesting

298
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,850
I want to get out quickly.

299
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:16,227
I see, next is Watanabe who went to a soba shop.

300
00:27:20,878 --> 00:27:23,235
our lunch is at 3 o'clock

301
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,846
I sometimes eat what customers leave behind

302
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:30,267
So we eat anything, whether it's tempura rice bowl, oyakodon, or tamagodon

303
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:31,940
It's really delicious

304
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,623
But sometimes I get fed up with just going to the eat same foods, morning, noon, and night

305
00:27:38,642 --> 00:27:40,729
Hey ready?

306
00:27:44,071 --> 00:27:46,244
It's tough to deliver food.

307
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:51,228
My senior, Macchan, can carry about 20 dishes.

308
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:54,495
Of course, it took more than three years to get to learn this.

309
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,271
Hey ready?

310
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:08,649
Take care.

311
00:28:11,917 --> 00:28:12,763
Hey.

312
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:14,870
Watch out.

313
00:28:15,715 --> 00:28:16,682
It was close.

314
00:28:18,722 --> 00:28:20,109
hey, this isn't a laughing matter

315
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:21,530
Sorry.

316
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,260
Hurry up.

317
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:27,537
Take care.

318
00:28:36,645 --> 00:28:37,565
Ouch

319
00:28:44,012 --> 00:28:45,672
hey, this isn't a laughing matter

320
00:28:49,783 --> 00:28:52,783
Yeah, I'm sure I'll become a great soba shop owner

321
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:58,164
Please say hello to everyone, and also to Teacher Ichiko Numata...

322
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,807
You and Ichiko.....well, the rest doesn't really matter...

323
00:29:02,496 --> 00:29:07,054
Um, Tsuyoshi Nishiyama, who went to the auto repair shop.

324
00:29:09,753 --> 00:29:11,580
how is everyone doing?

325
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,900
I have gotten used to both my work and the environment

326
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,547
The mechanic has to learn how to drive the Ohto three-wheeler first

327
00:29:23,999 --> 00:29:25,717
Turn right.

328
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,661
keep cutting

329
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:38,924
More.

330
00:29:46,227 --> 00:29:47,293
Stop.

331
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:50,799
Try going backwards.

332
00:29:55,443 --> 00:29:57,110
Hey.

333
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,496
Try going backwards.

334
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,798
Stop.

335
00:30:10,764 --> 00:30:12,190
What's wrong?

336
00:30:13,985 --> 00:30:15,573
I'm sorry

337
00:30:17,663 --> 00:30:18,583
Hey, you idiot!

338
00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:20,430
I'm sorry

339
00:30:27,099 --> 00:30:28,265
Inoue-sensei?

340
00:30:31,342 --> 00:30:32,645
Did you talk to that kid?

341
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:35,629
Oh, I'll try talking to him today

342
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,290
Inoue-kun,come

343
00:30:55,301 --> 00:30:55,915
What's wrong?

344
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,001
Have a seat.

345
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,287
this snack is really good, you know

346
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,120
Actually, we need to start preparing for
next year's employment system, you know?

347
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,086
Am I going to be the one doing it again?

348
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,488
I was thinking of asking you for help

349
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,867
You've gotten used to it.

350
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:21,836
but if you say I'm used
to it, I can't deny that.

351
00:31:23,135 --> 00:31:24,597
I really don't want to get used to something like this

352
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,157
Don't say like that.

353
00:31:27,148 --> 00:31:33,685
I think it's important for graduating students to find employment here

354
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:34,554
I understand that

355
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,820
Few students graduate from high school and go to college.

356
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,783
But how many students can't do that.

357
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,101
They will be the ones who lay the groundwork for society in the future

358
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:50,215
In reality, they are the ones who will stand and support the foundation of the world

359
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:53,829
I think they are the most important person

360
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,853
Principal, I became a teacher

361
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,039
because I want to be an educator

362
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,479
I want to study more about myself while I still can

363
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,495
I need some time

364
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,010
Well, I can understand that

365
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,820
You were a farmer's son, weren't you?

366
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,146
Yes but so what?

367
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:20,729
Living in the countryside is a big challenge.

368
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,885
In any case, In the future, they will definitely have to go abroad to work.

369
00:32:26,749 --> 00:32:30,831
I won't force you to do this, but please think about it carefully.

370
00:32:32,237 --> 00:32:37,128
It's convenient for me that you, who understand the situation, will continue

371
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:58,702
So, you didn't say a word about marriage?

372
00:33:00,202 --> 00:33:01,893
It's okay if I talk to the principal!

373
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:02,862
Don't worry.

374
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,167
I'm not going to take the principal's daughter

375
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,885
I'm going to take you

376
00:33:08,430 --> 00:33:11,636
We should just submit a marriage
notification to the principal

377
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,362
and say that if he wants to come to the wedding

378
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:25,940
What's wrong?

379
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,510
It seems like they can't take a break because of the work

380
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,495
But today is the third day.

381
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:34,823
Tsugio is currently negotiating., but I wonder if it will go well

382
00:33:37,005 --> 00:33:39,510
I've got urgent work piling up today

383
00:33:39,991 --> 00:33:41,463
I've decided to cancel my day off

384
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:45,090
Our situation is different from your thriving factory

385
00:34:18,615 --> 00:34:21,615
Hey, what are you looking at?

386
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
You didn't come to Tokyo just to have fun.
You're here to work

387
00:34:35,132 --> 00:34:36,917
Excuse me, President

388
00:34:37,612 --> 00:34:38,659
What?

389
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:43,042
 I would like to go to night school

390
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:44,195
night school?

391
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,979
That was the promise we made at the start.

392
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,936
Workers don't need education

393
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,996
It's just a waste of time

394
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:55,510
You should say that when you can do the job properly.

395
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,409
What should we do?

396
00:34:59,714 --> 00:35:00,831
Lets go home

397
00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:05,175
what should we send as a wedding gift for the teacher?

398
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,926
Look for it in the department store

399
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:09,635
Let's also cover Shiro and Makoto's share.

400
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,575
let's go to Asakusa today

401
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,870
It's boring, I went there the other day

402
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,556
Hey, how about going somewhere to take a boat.

403
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:18,616
Sounds good, I'm in!

404
00:35:18,641 --> 00:35:21,641
I thought that Mr. Inoue and Ms. Ichiko had a dating

405
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,276
Don't say bullshit.

406
00:35:24,690 --> 00:35:26,436
Let's buy some gifts soon

407
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,996
Which department shall we go to?

408
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,020
There are as many department stores in Tokyo as there are tobacco shops.

409
00:36:18,214 --> 00:36:19,401
They are here

410
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,424
it looks like a lovely bride

411
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:27,985
Don't push me.

412
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,631
Oh.

413
00:36:50,806 --> 00:36:52,702
Where have you been?

414
00:36:53,538 --> 00:36:54,932
I went to buy this

415
00:36:55,386 --> 00:36:57,323
You don't have to be drunk.

416
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,994
Now it's time to show off our skills

417
00:37:03,444 --> 00:37:05,448
We just finished

418
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,534
It was tough.

419
00:37:09,597 --> 00:37:10,776
 please

420
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:15,276
Wow, this is The principal's wife

421
00:37:15,323 --> 00:37:16,752
Thank you very much for everything.

422
00:37:16,777 --> 00:37:18,776
Everything ended safely.

423
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,277
Congratulations!

424
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,769
Come here

425
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:25,501
Well then, I'll be waiting for you later

426
00:37:31,807 --> 00:37:33,115
What do you want to do?

427
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:35,716
Everyone has been looking for you,

428
00:37:40,178 --> 00:37:43,178
I bought a new one.

429
00:37:47,827 --> 00:37:50,502
There are many customers who don't drink alcohol.

430
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,576
Look, that person hates alcohol

431
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Unfortunately

432
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,144
Call Ishiya.

433
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,464
Come.

434
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,850
Osono

435
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,737
It seems that Ichiro has returned,

436
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,659
but what's going on?

437
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,050
He seems to have some urgent business.

438
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,995
He doesn't go to a job

439
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,151
It's all over.

440
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,876
Well, it seems like everything is just about done

441
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:45,729
Yeah.

442
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,183
Where is my sewing machine?

443
00:38:47,208 --> 00:38:49,745
I placed an order so I'll deliver it when it arrives.

444
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,417
That was very expensive.

445
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,104
Hey, I only got a sewing machine from my brother

446
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,316
Thank you very much

447
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,726
Thank you for your hard work

448
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,666
Well, let's have dinner then

449
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,049
Okay, I'll go this way

450
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,016
I used all my savings for everything else,
even bought Shelf stuff.

451
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,690
It's too late for you to complain to me
now; until now.

452
00:39:11,848 --> 00:39:16,600
I was putting all my salary into everyone
else's needs without even buying what I wanted

453
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,266
You have no right to complain to me

454
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,049
What? Then I'll say it to you.

455
00:39:22,848 --> 00:39:24,736
Who do you think
helped me earn until today?

456
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,167
Thanks to whom was I able to go to school?

457
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,840
It's been six years since our dad fell ill, and it's like a different world

458
00:39:30,979 --> 00:39:34,002
If I keep sending tuition every month,
who would forget?

459
00:39:34,938 --> 00:39:37,938
Brother, you don't like that I didn't go to Yamazaki's place, do you?

460
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,800
I don't like Inoue.

461
00:39:43,823 --> 00:39:45,269
What's the hell?

462
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:46,799
He is a really bad guy

463
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,463
So I even held
the wedding at my house, didn't I?

464
00:39:52,379 --> 00:39:53,565
Now, let's go to the tatami room

465
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,463
Come on, brother

466
00:39:55,033 --> 00:39:57,018
You will probably regret it later

467
00:39:57,045 --> 00:39:58,768
you really say some awful things

468
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,546
If I marry to that agricultural cooperative person,

469
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,292
Sure, it might be convenient for you,

470
00:40:03,942 --> 00:40:06,668
but I won't always go along with your convenience

471
00:40:06,997 --> 00:40:08,853
You did try to use me.

472
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,299
I understand it properly, you know

473
00:40:11,671 --> 00:40:14,893
You're making a face like you oppose this marriage, aren't you?

474
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:18,104
What? Don't say like that.

475
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:19,406
That's true.

476
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:19,916
Come here

477
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:20,736
What are you talking about!

478
00:40:22,047 --> 00:40:23,849
Stop it.

479
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:28,307
Today is her celebration day.

480
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:30,432
Damn it.

481
00:40:35,069 --> 00:40:37,235
Everything is over.

482
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,893
please take this

483
00:40:41,012 --> 00:40:43,108
Hey you too.

484
00:40:43,596 --> 00:40:46,877
My legs hurt so I want to stretch them

485
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:49,619
Let's take it easy.

486
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:52,757
Where is the bride?

487
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,752
Ah, I see, I see

488
00:40:56,964 --> 00:40:59,073
She's coming.

489
00:41:03,104 --> 00:41:05,235
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

490
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,590
what's going on here?

491
00:41:16,089 --> 00:41:16,964
What's wrong?

492
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,058
Inoue-san, let's have a drink together.

493
00:41:23,253 --> 00:41:28,706
A man should get married and have a family

494
00:41:29,526 --> 00:41:32,245
After that it gradually calms down

495
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:35,167
I don't want to do any more job placements.

496
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:38,214
Don't say bullshit.

497
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,291
Someone from the school is here

498
00:41:44,974 --> 00:41:47,974
I wonder if something's wrong?

499
00:41:52,511 --> 00:41:53,401
What's wrong?

500
00:41:53,578 --> 00:41:56,578
A telegram arrived from Tokyo.

501
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:02,643
There seems to have been some problem with the student who got the job.

502
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,909
Thank you for your work.

503
00:42:06,511 --> 00:42:07,315
What's wrong?

504
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:09,409
A telegram arrived from Tokyo.

505
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:14,750
Two people from the glass factory have dropped out

506
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:18,541
Please contact us immediately.

507
00:42:19,472 --> 00:42:22,120
They must be Shiro and Makoto.

508
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,518
They come back here?

509
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:26,649
I think they will contact you if they are back.

510
00:42:27,189 --> 00:42:28,705
I will go to Tokyo

511
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,806
Are you really going?

512
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:35,127
your bride must be feeling sad, right?

513
00:42:35,495 --> 00:42:37,675
Don't worry.
Let's go

514
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,106
I want to go too.

515
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,312
That's better. It's good
to go together, isn't it?

516
00:42:42,181 --> 00:42:43,760
Sorry about that

517
00:42:44,087 --> 00:42:45,815
You should prepare

518
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,034
Thank you everyone.

519
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:51,436
You have had a tough time.

520
00:42:54,407 --> 00:42:57,407
It's my responsibility when it comes to those kids

521
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,560
I'm really sorry to you

522
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,260
Just think of it as a honeymoon trip

523
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:30,042
A honeymoon trip, huh,

524
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:37,336
I received a call from the Ueno police station late

525
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:41,784
They were apparently taken into custody as part of a crackdown on delinquent youth.

526
00:43:42,330 --> 00:43:44,716
I went ahead and contacted the glass factory just in case

527
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,016
The police are over there

528
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:50,901
teacher?

529
00:43:53,595 --> 00:43:55,987
What happened to you guys?

530
00:43:56,214 --> 00:43:57,980
They said you left the factory two days ago

531
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,560
We were looking for another job

532
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:06,557
We were in a pachinko parlor.

533
00:44:09,252 --> 00:44:10,206
So, you guys

534
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,446
Did you leave because you hated that factory?

535
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:14,776
If you didn't like it, you should have told Muto.

536
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:17,385
I thought it was useless to do that

537
00:44:19,214 --> 00:44:20,534
sit down.

538
00:44:21,939 --> 00:44:24,965
There were many things that were different from the initial promise.

539
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:26,752
What do you mean?

540
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,432
There are many people in the world without jobs,

541
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,386
you can't say that in those situations

542
00:44:33,588 --> 00:44:35,886
Teacher, we don't have holiday either

543
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,910
When they said they would give me a salary of 2500 yen, it turned out to be 1500 yen

544
00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:41,166
When they said they would let us go to night school, but it was a lie

545
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:42,196
In between work, we take care of the dog,

546
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:45,042
fill the bath with water, and work
every night

547
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:48,186
I'm too tired to write the letter

548
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:50,917
That's terrible, isn't it?

549
00:44:51,558 --> 00:44:53,823
I'm really sorry to keep you waiting

550
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,200
Oh, please go over there. It's your father's pick-up, so come out

551
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:56,580
Please go there.

552
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,920
Your dad is here, come on

553
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:18,060
What is this situation? Where were we going to get involved?

554
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:19,842
I'm worried

555
00:45:19,972 --> 00:45:21,913
Dad, please don't say that right now

556
00:45:22,254 --> 00:45:23,487
Wakabayashi

557
00:45:26,526 --> 00:45:28,100
Explain the situation well

558
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:29,894
Yes, let's head over there.

559
00:45:35,810 --> 00:45:37,790
You all come this way too

560
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:45,752
We were cracking down on juvenile delinquents.

561
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,078
I realized it was a mistake right away,

562
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:49,915
I stopped because it was too late,

563
00:45:50,346 --> 00:45:51,306
Thank you

564
00:45:53,005 --> 00:45:53,595
Well, as you know,

565
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:56,620
Today is May day, so we are busy

566
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:58,576
Look like that.

567
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:01,600
Section chief, someone like this is visiting you.

568
00:46:02,862 --> 00:46:04,389
Get him throgh here

569
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:10,407
Come in

570
00:46:12,105 --> 00:46:14,532
Oh, I'm sorry for being late

571
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,130
Why you are at the police?

572
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:26,150
This is Mr. Inoue from Hirata Junior High School, who has come to Tokyo

573
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:28,097
I'm Ogata

574
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,025
The children are in your care

575
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,406
Please have a seat

576
00:46:40,182 --> 00:46:41,705
Yes, let's get started

577
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:44,601
It seems that you are forcing overwork

578
00:46:45,750 --> 00:46:47,260
I hear that you are forcing night work.

579
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:49,445
Because they are all healthy

580
00:46:49,653 --> 00:46:51,772
I would like to ask about the salary and night shift pay

581
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:53,840
It seems different from what was promised,

582
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,482
even if you mention the salary

583
00:46:56,927 --> 00:46:58,893
I took the child unconditionally

584
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:02,286
In the first six months or even the first year,

585
00:47:02,310 --> 00:47:04,704
it's actually more like I want to receive something from you.

586
00:47:05,286 --> 00:47:09,353
How difficult of a situation our small company is being pushed into

587
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,426
Yes, I understand that it's tough

588
00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:13,240
Basically, the government is to blame

589
00:47:13,779 --> 00:47:16,155
This is a story about a small factory
that should just collapse

590
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:19,106
If a big disruptor appears in the neighborhood,

591
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,130
factories like ours will just fall apart in no time

592
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:28,012
What are you guys going to do?

593
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,496
there's no need to hold back;

594
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,626
just say what you're thinking
Speak clearly

595
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,766
I don't want to go factory anymore

596
00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:40,790
I wanna work somewhere else

597
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:53,056
Is that Chinzō group still ongoing?

598
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,746
They are doing city tour, right?

599
00:47:54,770 --> 00:47:57,446
I was impressed by those people's persistence

600
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:00,296
this is an important time

601
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,656
I asked for it on the phone earlier

602
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,006
We are from Hirata junior high school.

603
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:04,666
I know

604
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:05,806
It's on the second floor

605
00:48:05,872 --> 00:48:07,018
Guide them.

606
00:48:10,518 --> 00:48:13,518
There are a lot of people who use the Prefectural Association's dormitory, too.

607
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,816
since they are inexpensive

608
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,650
Oh yeah.

609
00:48:21,785 --> 00:48:24,785
Those guys over there

610
00:48:24,810 --> 00:48:26,436
I was on the train with the director today,

611
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:27,646
and I escaped to the national teacher

612
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:28,956
Aren't those two boys just a bit too much?

613
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,836
If you can find another job,

614
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,586
you can come here and tell me about it

615
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,590
You showed me that newspaper.

616
00:48:36,036 --> 00:48:37,905
Well, of course, they are from our prefecture, right?

617
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:40,723
Of course, it's Shiratamura in your electoral district.

618
00:48:41,237 --> 00:48:42,945
Um, it's over there

619
00:48:45,016 --> 00:48:46,212
Um, well.

620
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,168
this, this.

621
00:48:57,863 --> 00:49:02,426
I see This is terrible, poor children

622
00:49:08,205 --> 00:49:08,642
Phone.

623
00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:16,011
Eat this.

624
00:49:16,418 --> 00:49:17,224
How about teachers?

625
00:49:17,569 --> 00:49:19,005
We bought them for you guys

626
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:19,491
Eat up.

627
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:20,656
I brought some tea

628
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,362
There's no tea or anything

629
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:25,152
It's tough if your throat gets tired

630
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,120
Come on, eat up.

631
00:49:30,354 --> 00:49:31,480
Thank you very much.

632
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:06,843
Why were you guys hanging out in Ueno?

633
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,073
No matter how much we search,we can't find a good job

634
00:50:09,361 --> 00:50:10,775
I thought we should go back to the countryside

635
00:50:10,808 --> 00:50:13,252
Even if you go back to the countryside, it won't change anything, and even if I go to Tokyo, it won't help either

636
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:15,292
We can't do anything here.

637
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,425
What if we joined the Self-Defense Forces?

638
00:50:20,237 --> 00:50:21,714
It's too early

639
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,143
whatever it is

640
00:50:23,168 --> 00:50:25,347
that's not good. Not everything can be okay.

641
00:50:32,073 --> 00:50:33,401
Oh, it's already done,

642
00:50:33,565 --> 00:50:34,956
 I'm sorry

643
00:50:34,981 --> 00:50:36,455
It was very delicious.

644
00:50:36,955 --> 00:50:38,876
Please show me the timetable

645
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:39,705
Yeah, why?

646
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:40,690
Please show me

647
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,776
I'm going to Hamamatsu for a bit

648
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:48,166
Apparently there's a store that wants to hire a man.

649
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,866
Maybe you guys
can work too

650
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:52,616
Sorry, but everyone

651
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,916
please stay here together

652
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,120
I'll be back soon

653
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,874
but you can't go home tonight, right?

654
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:05,714
Hmm,

655
00:51:10,344 --> 00:51:11,557
I'm taking this train.

656
00:51:36,830 --> 00:51:39,830
I'm from Hirata Junior High

657
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,186
What do you need?

658
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:42,995
I would like to meet with our student

659
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:46,655
Is something wrong?

660
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:49,680
The factory has been closed for about a week now

661
00:51:50,490 --> 00:51:52,866
And what about the girls?

662
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:16,688
They were selected from our prefecture for today's encouragement meeting

663
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:21,804
Member of Parliament Yoshirō Tsukamoto has
kindly provided us with his busy schedule

664
00:52:21,973 --> 00:52:25,534
He came to encourage you.

665
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,746
I would like to ask him for greetings

666
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:30,683
Please.

667
00:52:57,453 --> 00:52:58,955
Well then, welcome back

668
00:52:59,214 --> 00:52:59,948
Oh, I'm sorry

669
00:53:00,112 --> 00:53:03,112
I was worried. I thought there might have been an accident or something

670
00:53:04,081 --> 00:53:06,604
and the factory is on the verge of collapsing, so they are taking a break

671
00:53:07,472 --> 00:53:10,472
Well, it's not about asking for a job; it's about being a role model to encourage everyone

672
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:12,746
Yuko and the others were feeling anxious,

673
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:14,796
so I stayed with the conductor at the factory

674
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,296
Shiro-chan found a job

675
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:17,388
Really?

676
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:18,901
The professional is here now.

677
00:53:19,658 --> 00:53:20,990
It's someone named Tsukamoto

678
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:22,183
Zengorou Tsukamoto

679
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,449
It's said that the he is an advisor for Maruishi Bicycles.

680
00:53:25,474 --> 00:53:26,683
That's great!

681
00:53:26,932 --> 00:53:28,088
Well,he took a look at the newspaper

682
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:31,160
Last night, he went out of his way to contact us

683
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,315
We are from Fukushima Commercial Broadcasting.

684
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:50,674
Let's all help each other if we're interested

685
00:53:52,517 --> 00:54:00,315
Although we are not related by blood, we must take good care of these children.

686
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:04,955
We are the newspaper

687
00:54:08,217 --> 00:54:10,448
Please strike a pose

688
00:54:12,828 --> 00:54:15,828
Oh, this is a bit strange

689
00:54:17,636 --> 00:54:19,237
How about this?

690
00:54:20,308 --> 00:54:22,433
Thank you very much.

691
00:54:22,964 --> 00:54:24,815
Excuse me.

692
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:33,596
Everyone, I think some of you may already know from the newspaper history

693
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:42,862
Mr. Tsukamoto will help two children who have escaped from the factory.

694
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:47,541
bringing them the sun of hope

695
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,011
Don't say like that.

696
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:53,635
The newspapers found out about it.

697
00:54:54,006 --> 00:54:56,451
I wonder where Sakata-kun and Saito-kun are. Sakata-kun, right?

698
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,612
Saito-kun, where are you?

699
00:55:00,479 --> 00:55:01,875
Hey, He is calling you

700
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,308
Please raise your hands.

701
00:55:04,135 --> 00:55:05,475
We are right here

702
00:55:05,797 --> 00:55:08,822
Alright,Please come here.

703
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:11,198
let's go, let's go

704
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,316
Yes, yes, yes, please come up

705
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,440
Excuse me, could you come here ?

706
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:27,502
Take a photo from there

707
00:55:27,879 --> 00:55:30,879
please give a round of applause to these boys

708
00:56:02,154 --> 00:56:03,508
Is this okay?

709
00:56:03,533 --> 00:56:04,664
Thank you anyway

710
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,756
It doesn't matter what Tsukamoto Zengo's purpose is

711
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:21,780
Anyway, as long as they can work

712
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:26,618
It's hard to take care of them.

713
00:56:27,966 --> 00:56:30,966
Their dreams and reality are too different, you know?

714
00:56:41,282 --> 00:56:43,134
Starting next year,You shouldn't work this role

715
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,774
You can't study on your own

716
00:56:54,048 --> 00:56:56,711
But Someone has to work this role

717
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:58,235
I think someone can do it

718
00:56:58,460 --> 00:56:59,953
That's not going to work

719
00:57:00,274 --> 00:57:05,305
You said you were going to quit, didn't you?

720
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,498
Nobody wants to willingly do something like this

721
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:39,670
this has turned into a rather strange wedding

722
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,414
But maybe something like this is actually fitting for our wedding

723
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:47,055
Ichiko-sensei

724
00:57:47,901 --> 00:57:50,688
Stop calling me 'sensei'! It sounds weird,

725
00:57:50,713 --> 00:57:51,610
so what should I be called instead?

726
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:55,524
Ichiko or you

727
00:57:58,401 --> 00:57:59,344
what happened?

728
00:57:59,369 --> 00:58:00,063
This

729
00:58:00,837 --> 00:58:02,555
Oh, sorry, sorry.

730
00:58:16,150 --> 00:58:19,150
Ah, it's going to be hot again today

731
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,836
Oh, Sensei

732
00:58:28,419 --> 00:58:31,419
Principal and also Inoue-sensei

733
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:34,298
She's Nishiyama's mom

734
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,508
It's been quite hot lately, hasn't it?

735
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:40,852
How's Shinzo doing?

736
00:58:41,196 --> 00:58:42,735
He's fine, thank you.

737
00:58:43,524 --> 00:58:45,493
Where are you going?

738
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:47,560
That's why I'm concerned about next year's job situation

739
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,780
We are going to the Tokyo Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare

740
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:55,219
I'd appreciate it if you could take care of her.

741
00:58:56,129 --> 00:58:57,795
I was thinking of meeting him up if I have some time

742
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,786
Did you get a letter from him?

743
00:58:59,172 --> 00:59:00,766
He wrote me a letter the other day.

744
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:03,256
He said he never had a day off from work.

745
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,546
Please tell him we are fine

746
00:59:06,781 --> 00:59:07,821
Ah, bus has arrived

747
00:59:08,055 --> 00:59:09,188
Take care.

748
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:14,664
Good morning!

749
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:20,766
Take care.

750
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:39,399
Well, this is quite troublesome. Please refrain from doing such things.

751
00:59:39,837 --> 00:59:44,774
Don't say like that.
I apologize for bringing this up so soon

752
00:59:45,260 --> 00:59:51,266
What do you think about the outlook for next
year's junior high school graduates?

753
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,290
even if we say outlook, it's pretty much the same as before

754
00:59:54,770 --> 00:59:56,980
It probably won't change much from this year

755
00:59:57,970 --> 01:00:00,970
I think our school will see a significant increase compared to this year

756
01:00:01,254 --> 01:00:04,254
That's right, everywhere is on the rise

757
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:08,160
As for me, I am putting a lot of effort into developing new workplaces

758
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,225
director,Someone came to pick you up

759
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:12,256
Oh you.

760
01:00:12,281 --> 01:00:14,247
Call Muto.

761
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:16,457
This is for takeout

762
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:20,186
Once the job application form is ready,

763
01:00:20,210 --> 01:00:21,836
I will distribute it to each school

764
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,996
Um, Can you let me know about them in advance?

765
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:29,285
I have other things to do today.

766
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:30,965
so I will take my leave now

767
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:34,840
Hey, welcome,

768
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:36,090
Thank you for the other day.

769
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,223
I'm just heading out for a bit

770
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,386
I often receive your messages

771
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:41,191
I see, thank you for your patience

772
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:53,965
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

773
01:00:54,095 --> 01:00:54,605
Please.

774
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:55,598
See you.

775
01:01:00,512 --> 01:01:03,036
He is Mr. Onoda from Kitayama Middle School.

776
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:04,965
Is there some kind of meeting?

777
01:01:05,770 --> 01:01:07,456
He's Principal Aizawa.

778
01:01:07,481 --> 01:01:08,383
Nice to meet you,

779
01:01:08,547 --> 01:01:11,715
thank you for all your help

780
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:13,196
Thank you for your hard work

781
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,020
Please, come in

782
01:01:15,705 --> 01:01:18,705
Please bring me something cold

783
01:01:26,942 --> 01:01:28,309
Welcome back.

784
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:44,270
Welcome back

785
01:01:44,882 --> 01:01:46,214
Want dinner?

786
01:01:47,825 --> 01:01:49,450
No.

787
01:01:58,684 --> 01:02:00,515
It must have been hot, right?

788
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:02,246
Why don't you have it in the bath

789
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:03,936
It's too late.

790
01:02:04,334 --> 01:02:06,684
I am already preparing for that.

791
01:02:10,108 --> 01:02:11,315
Is there any beer available?

792
01:02:11,355 --> 01:02:12,941
I'll borrow some from next door.

793
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:14,629
that's fine.

794
01:02:41,269 --> 01:02:42,771
I talked to principle.

795
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:46,074
I think it's better for you to stay until the end of this month after all

796
01:02:55,127 --> 01:02:58,127
It's still fine, right? I can still be here for three or four months.

797
01:03:01,856 --> 01:03:04,450
Are you okay with working at a sewing machine?

798
01:03:05,671 --> 01:03:07,503
Isn't this the most important time
for your body?

799
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,051
I know that getting married means having kids,

800
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,629
but maybe it was a bit too early

801
01:03:21,642 --> 01:03:23,318
What does that mean?

802
01:03:23,343 --> 01:03:24,270
Well....

803
01:03:30,230 --> 01:03:33,248
I don't want to end up as a middle school teacher

804
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,863
I don't want to work in employment agencies anymore.

805
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,395
That's all about your mindset.

806
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,613
Didn't you say before that you wanted to quit this kind of role?

807
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:43,616
Yes, but now it's different

808
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,605
How is it different?

809
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:51,082
I really want you to become a true educator

810
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:54,806
I've started thinking this way
since I had baby.

811
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:57,166
Is someone who runs around in the employment
department a true educator?

812
01:03:57,190 --> 01:03:59,556
Teaching in class room isn't the only form of education

813
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,756
Don't be cheeky

814
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:01,987
Is that so?

815
01:04:05,186 --> 01:04:08,952
When women get married and have children,
they all tend to have such passive thoughts

816
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:11,670
It's not that I'm being negative

817
01:04:12,110 --> 01:04:14,030
Your feet aren't on the ground

818
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,772
What? Say that again

819
01:04:18,921 --> 01:04:19,843
Good evening

820
01:04:23,670 --> 01:04:27,522
Ah, were you back? Thank you for your hard work

821
01:04:27,812 --> 01:04:29,624
Are you Tsuyoshi's mother?

822
01:04:29,649 --> 01:04:31,288
I wonder if he is doing well

823
01:04:31,313 --> 01:04:33,131
I called, but I couldn't meet him because he was busy

824
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:34,853
He seems to be doing well.

825
01:04:34,878 --> 01:04:43,233
Is that so? I just wanted to give this
little bit to you, teacher, for you to eat

826
01:04:45,656 --> 01:04:47,045
Oh, thank you.

827
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:49,945
This is a nice color

828
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:51,536
You used to like this too

829
01:04:52,380 --> 01:04:54,139
If that's the case, I just chilled it a bit

830
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:05,255
You guys get along well.

831
01:05:32,937 --> 01:05:35,485
Just because your friend got license

832
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,527
why do you have to be the one to get a ride?

833
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:43,762
You are in a privileged position, after all

834
01:05:46,260 --> 01:05:49,260
You really need to understand that part well

835
01:05:49,630 --> 01:05:52,656
Well, there's nothing
we can do about it today,

836
01:05:52,763 --> 01:05:54,283
Thank you very much.

837
01:06:21,598 --> 01:06:23,320
Oh

838
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:27,096
what did you come here for?

839
01:06:27,763 --> 01:06:30,285
I came to see you

840
01:06:31,022 --> 01:06:35,137
The women's association in the village decided to inspect the stadium,

841
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,476
and I was chosen as the representative to come

842
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:40,326
and help with the construction of the stadium

843
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,350
I'm glad it's a big factory

844
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:48,067
Mr. Tsukamoto is such a kind person

845
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,886
Everyone just dispersed a little while ago

846
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:53,486
I'm going home on the train this evening

847
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:57,059
They said you can't come because we're busy during the day

848
01:06:57,084 --> 01:07:00,084
You're going to the night school, right?

849
01:07:00,532 --> 01:07:03,532
We are not going to night school

850
01:07:04,509 --> 01:07:06,025
This is our pamphlet

851
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:07,900
Thank you for your reference

852
01:07:08,103 --> 01:07:10,669
Hey, you all, I'm going to give you a break from now on

853
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,039
why don't you try talking her somewhere?

854
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:15,400
it would be nice if you could make a great sightseeing in Tokyo  with the kids

855
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:18,916
If I can see their cheerful faces,

856
01:07:19,225 --> 01:07:21,365
then I can talk to everyone

857
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:22,486
Change your clothes.

858
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,706
Thank you very much.

859
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:26,847
Let's get ready.

860
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:29,134
Please wait a moment

861
01:07:49,749 --> 01:07:50,916
4 cold noodles.

862
01:07:51,097 --> 01:07:52,410
4 cold noodles.

863
01:07:55,593 --> 01:07:57,592
Oh, you came!

864
01:07:58,888 --> 01:08:01,262
Auntie, you came here well,

865
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,433
You've grown up

866
01:08:03,987 --> 01:08:06,356
Since you are here, They let me have a break

867
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:07,518
I want to eat quickly.

868
01:08:07,549 --> 01:08:09,743
What, you haven't ordered yet?

869
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,513
We've been waiting until you got back

870
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:14,730
Alright, I'll have whatever you want to order

871
01:08:14,755 --> 01:08:16,876
Thanks for treating us

872
01:08:16,983 --> 01:08:19,065
In exchange, say everyone

873
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:20,951
You had something delicious at my place

874
01:08:21,456 --> 01:08:22,356
What do you want?

875
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:24,016
It's already decided that we're having tempura rice bowl

876
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:26,090
Alright, three tempura rice bowls.

877
01:08:26,218 --> 01:08:27,555
Yes, three tempura rice bowls

878
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,267
It'll be ready soon,

879
01:08:31,726 --> 01:08:33,333
Hey look.

880
01:08:34,030 --> 01:08:35,683
Isn't that Tsuyoshi?

881
01:08:40,985 --> 01:08:41,885
That's amazing,

882
01:08:41,986 --> 01:08:43,593
He passed the exam in one go!

883
01:08:44,009 --> 01:08:45,660
Oh, you got your driver's license?

884
01:08:45,774 --> 01:08:46,494
That's great!

885
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:47,636
I'm going to practice today

886
01:08:49,856 --> 01:08:52,475
Are you going for date?

887
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,747
That's great!

888
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:56,886
What's up with Minoru?

889
01:08:56,910 --> 01:08:59,910
He has been sleeping for about a week because of his bronchitis

890
01:09:00,358 --> 01:09:01,845
That's a chest ailment.

891
01:09:02,477 --> 01:09:03,912
but it's not serious case.

892
01:09:04,380 --> 01:09:07,380
That guy isn't strong.

893
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:10,750
so should we visit him?

894
01:09:11,264 --> 01:09:12,537
No, no, don't do that

895
01:09:13,305 --> 01:09:13,992
Why not?

896
01:09:15,076 --> 01:09:16,823
It would be a problem if everyone know

897
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:21,412
Oh it's time to work.

898
01:09:21,780 --> 01:09:23,107
I see

899
01:09:23,132 --> 01:09:25,693
 well then, see you next time.

900
01:09:38,893 --> 01:09:41,893
See you again, goodbye.

901
01:10:50,651 --> 01:10:51,997
I’m sorry.

902
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,021
This is the smell of grass.

903
01:11:31,529 --> 01:11:32,740
This is the smell of sea.

904
01:11:37,737 --> 01:11:38,979
kayo-chan?

905
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:46,570
I'm a fine mechanic

906
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:52,404
A fine mechanic must know everything about cars

907
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:57,857
I feel like I want to dive into the engine and become gasoline for a moment

908
01:11:58,810 --> 01:11:59,926
Don't rush it

909
01:11:59,950 --> 01:12:01,786
You have to graduate one step at a time,

910
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:04,357
but you've completed an important stage

911
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:06,505
You got your driver's license, right?

912
01:12:09,689 --> 01:12:12,255
You're going to be a nurse?

913
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,708
I still have a long way to go.

914
01:12:14,737 --> 01:12:16,863
whenever I think about studying, I get sleepy

915
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,958
I'm going to become independent and take charge around 30.

916
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:24,281
You're a hard worker,

917
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,169
so I'm sure you will make it.

918
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:29,852
You have to get a bride first, right?

919
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:32,154
A bride?

920
01:13:22,951 --> 01:13:24,245
I'm home.

921
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,136
What have you been doing until now?

922
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:27,870
You have a customer, right?

923
01:13:31,533 --> 01:13:32,833
Yuko.

924
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:36,536
What happened to you,

925
01:13:36,942 --> 01:13:38,416
The factory went bankrupt.

926
01:13:41,172 --> 01:13:43,314
Oh, is that so? What about Aki chan and others.

927
01:13:43,610 --> 01:13:45,756
Akichan and Masachan are going to work in Hamamatsu

928
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:47,475
They went to a coffee shop,

929
01:13:48,019 --> 01:13:50,867
Kacchan ended up becoming a service girl at a hotel in Osaka

930
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:57,677
I thought there might be something in Tokyo, so I came out here

931
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:02,496
Until I find a job

932
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:03,826
Can you let me stay as maid here?

933
01:14:04,934 --> 01:14:06,125
It's fine to be free of charge

934
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,729
Try asking the wife.

935
01:14:17,830 --> 01:14:18,437
See you

936
01:14:18,797 --> 01:14:20,166
Buy a medicine and come back

937
01:14:41,839 --> 01:14:42,628
What's wrong?

938
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,436
The truck we repaired yesterday got stuck in the river with the steel materials still loaded

939
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,836
It got stuck in the river with
the steel materials still on board

940
01:14:46,860 --> 01:14:48,539
They say it's our repair fault, you know

941
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,086
Three people died,

942
01:15:02,038 --> 01:15:04,367
Sorry to keep you waiting.

943
01:15:06,664 --> 01:15:09,664
There's nothing wrong.

944
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,306
You should drive us there

945
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:16,330
Please, go ahead and get in

946
01:15:16,532 --> 01:15:17,594
Don't worry about it

947
01:15:32,551 --> 01:15:35,551
Today's work is finished

948
01:15:51,591 --> 01:15:53,305
Shall we head home?

949
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:57,462
Tsuyoshi.

950
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:04,798
Do you want to drink tea?

951
01:16:05,022 --> 01:16:06,360
Just wait a moment.

952
01:16:06,987 --> 01:16:09,625
there's no point in worrying about it now,

953
01:16:09,912 --> 01:16:11,448
so let's have a drink of shochu to lighten the mood

954
01:16:11,473 --> 01:16:12,911
This is quite nice, isn't it?

955
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:14,473
Come on, let's not do that

956
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:20,210
But, isn't there anything we can do while we still have time?

957
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,352
It's nothing serious, really

958
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:27,036
This place isn't going to collapse, right?

959
01:16:27,060 --> 01:16:29,000
Don't say such bad luck things

960
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:32,910
But we might have to pay damages, right?

961
01:16:34,070 --> 01:16:37,852
We haven't had an accident like this until today

962
01:16:38,672 --> 01:16:43,206
However, working two nights straight
like this is such an unreasonable task

963
01:16:43,230 --> 01:16:47,742
If we did the same as other factories, they would take our jobs.

964
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,641
Well, that's true, but...

965
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:54,655
So, Tsuyoshi, do you want a drink?

966
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,055
I'm fine.

967
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:02,566
I'm really sorry about this, you know

968
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,755
Hurry up.

969
01:17:04,784 --> 01:17:06,594
Thank you very much.

970
01:17:07,219 --> 01:17:10,219
I'm sorry for making everyone take a break

971
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,526
Thank you for your work.

972
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:15,062
I will let everyone know about your achievements.

973
01:17:18,578 --> 01:17:20,341
so take care and stay healthy

974
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:22,156
Make sure to work hard!

975
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,180
and studying hard.

976
01:17:26,938 --> 01:17:28,235
Thank you very much.

977
01:17:39,772 --> 01:17:40,719
Sorry.

978
01:17:44,686 --> 01:17:47,686
She thought we'd been to night school.

979
01:17:48,879 --> 01:17:51,320
I really thought I should tell the truth

980
01:17:51,814 --> 01:17:53,367
but it's better to stay quiet

981
01:17:55,863 --> 01:17:57,003
I feel hot.

982
01:17:59,331 --> 01:18:00,985
You don't go to the night school but

983
01:18:01,010 --> 01:18:03,116
Why you wear high school uniform?

984
01:18:03,140 --> 01:18:03,836
Is this it?

985
01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:05,326
 You're pushing yourself,

986
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:07,266
I like to wear this.

987
01:18:07,290 --> 01:18:08,696
I've always wanted to wear this.

988
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:11,720
Don't dress up so extravagantly.

989
01:18:11,745 --> 01:18:13,418
You guys shouldn't be whining either.

990
01:18:14,126 --> 01:18:17,126
I'm not going to cry or whine

991
01:18:19,692 --> 01:18:21,045
even if I can't study

992
01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:23,295
I'm going to become a respectable person

993
01:18:32,440 --> 01:18:34,366
If such a big newspaper comes out,

994
01:18:34,390 --> 01:18:36,620
trust will take a hit

995
01:18:37,750 --> 01:18:40,750
It’s written as if we dropped the truck ourselves

996
01:18:49,470 --> 01:18:52,470
You know, I’ve been thinking about it

997
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:54,895
If it's the boss's responsibility, the commotion will get bigger

998
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:57,756
Well, what if this guy runs to the police?

999
01:18:57,781 --> 01:18:59,349
What do you mean?

1000
01:18:59,682 --> 01:19:02,246
If we say it's just a rookie's mistake,
the penalty will be lighter

1001
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:07,041
On that day, I was removing rust from another car

1002
01:19:08,110 --> 01:19:09,697
I know that already

1003
01:19:10,939 --> 01:19:14,412
Do you hate to save this factory?

1004
01:19:17,443 --> 01:19:19,410
Can you go to the police?

1005
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,396
that might be a good idea

1006
01:19:23,421 --> 01:19:24,746
This is the time

1007
01:19:24,770 --> 01:19:26,212
It's time to repay the favor to boss.

1008
01:19:29,027 --> 01:19:29,907
Wife.

1009
01:19:32,324 --> 01:19:33,370
What's going on?

1010
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:36,486
I've been asking on them until now

1011
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,576
It seems that we will have to cover half of the expenses

1012
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,965
That's terrible.

1013
01:19:40,139 --> 01:19:41,559
when is boss coming back?

1014
01:19:41,584 --> 01:19:43,792
I heard he might be back tonight.

1015
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:47,992
It seems that the compensation for the three deceased will be covered by Yamashita Construction,

1016
01:19:48,113 --> 01:19:50,229
but we will have to cover the truck's compensation

1017
01:19:50,254 --> 01:19:51,964
It's really troubling

1018
01:19:52,498 --> 01:19:54,418
it's not a small amount of money.

1019
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:59,240
So, I have a favor to ask you

1020
01:19:59,951 --> 01:20:02,897
It's about your month's salary

1021
01:20:02,941 --> 01:20:06,884
Wife, I actually have a good idea

1022
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:10,015
It was decided that we would sacrifice one victim

1023
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,734
What does that mean?

1024
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:47,712
Do you need something?

1025
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,500
Ah, I'm from the Tsuyama Auto Repair Shop

1026
01:20:51,623 --> 01:20:55,914
Tsuyama? Oh, the repair shop for the truck that got stuck in the river?

1027
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:58,383
The issue was just finished

1028
01:20:59,050 --> 01:21:02,707
The master is eating at the eel shop behind with the truck right now

1029
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:06,290
Don't worry, he'll be heading back around here

1030
01:21:12,502 --> 01:21:15,502
What are the factory saying about?

1031
01:21:15,910 --> 01:21:18,910
They say to cut the salary in half for the time being

1032
01:21:19,490 --> 01:21:22,086
Since the accident, we haven't had any work at all

1033
01:21:22,110 --> 01:21:25,110
I'm in trouble with half my salary.

1034
01:21:26,606 --> 01:21:28,879
I've been sending half of it to my family every month

1035
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:33,420
Starting next year, my younger brother will be going to school,

1036
01:21:33,540 --> 01:21:35,718
why quit and look for something else?

1037
01:21:36,464 --> 01:21:38,941
But I still want to do car repairs.

1038
01:21:39,295 --> 01:21:40,962
aren't there any other repair shops?

1039
01:21:43,202 --> 01:21:44,916
There's no job opening.

1040
01:21:48,130 --> 01:21:49,543
See you later

1041
01:21:56,095 --> 01:21:56,948
How are you?

1042
01:21:58,187 --> 01:21:59,535
Have you seen a doctor?

1043
01:22:03,892 --> 01:22:07,274
Yeah, go buy some eggs with this

1044
01:22:07,540 --> 01:22:08,233
Don't worry.

1045
01:22:08,559 --> 01:22:09,625
You're in trouble

1046
01:22:09,650 --> 01:22:11,716
 I'm just physically strong

1047
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:13,286
Even if things get a little tough, it'll work out somehow

1048
01:22:18,093 --> 01:22:19,547
Well, thank you

1049
01:22:20,147 --> 01:22:21,054
 it's all good

1050
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,271
We're in this together

1051
01:22:22,875 --> 01:22:24,795
Ah, it's raining

1052
01:22:25,968 --> 01:22:26,915
Oh my god.

1053
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,776
Take my umbrella.

1054
01:23:06,836 --> 01:23:09,277
It's unavoidable for now,

1055
01:23:09,690 --> 01:23:12,690
but please look for other good places eventually

1056
01:23:12,820 --> 01:23:17,569
Well, as long as the person is reliable, it doesn't matter where she works.

1057
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:21,187
Thank you for everything.

1058
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:22,974
Alright, let's go.

1059
01:23:24,033 --> 01:23:26,080
It's a nice place you live in

1060
01:23:26,690 --> 01:23:28,769
What a lovely kitchen!

1061
01:23:32,655 --> 01:23:34,535
If anything comes up, just give me a call, okay?

1062
01:23:34,841 --> 01:23:35,587
Kae?

1063
01:23:36,454 --> 01:23:38,507
You forgot something again

1064
01:23:38,555 --> 01:23:39,462
Sorry.

1065
01:23:39,917 --> 01:23:41,130
See you.

1066
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:45,285
So you're going again, huh?

1067
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,050
Yes.

1068
01:23:47,176 --> 01:23:49,239
Thank you for your help.

1069
01:23:50,829 --> 01:23:51,603
Take care.

1070
01:24:00,309 --> 01:24:01,619
Yuko

1071
01:24:25,923 --> 01:24:26,990
Here it is.

1072
01:24:28,659 --> 01:24:33,758
I'll take the first
month's salary as a thank you, okay?

1073
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:34,525
Yes.

1074
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,660
Excuse me, may I come in?

1075
01:24:45,868 --> 01:24:47,364
Come in.

1076
01:25:06,681 --> 01:25:08,173
Hey Tsuyoshi.

1077
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,915
You come over here, okay?

1078
01:25:14,603 --> 01:25:15,384
Yes.

1079
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:22,700
Well, you have to stop

1080
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,536
Is this factory going to shut down?

1081
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,439
There's nothing we can do about this

1082
01:25:28,200 --> 01:25:30,376
We suddenly lost my job.

1083
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,956
I had to compensate a huge amount of money for the truck

1084
01:25:33,025 --> 01:25:34,980
So what are we supposed to do from now on?

1085
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:37,087
If you say that, I can't really say....

1086
01:25:37,980 --> 01:25:38,786
but you guys too...

1087
01:25:38,810 --> 01:25:41,429
It's no use just sticking
around here forever.

1088
01:25:41,454 --> 01:25:42,367
what are you going to do, boss?

1089
01:25:44,765 --> 01:25:49,359
I think we could buy at least one new
souvenir truck instead of this rundown factory

1090
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:57,187
With that, I think we could do some work for a transport
company and get back to a point where we can own a factory again

1091
01:25:59,170 --> 01:26:02,170
So, will you come back again

1092
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,826
Boss?

1093
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:07,850
Isn't there any way to keep this factory running?

1094
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:08,816
Even if you say that...

1095
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:11,840
Aren't you the one saying this?

1096
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:15,246
I have nowhere to go anyway

1097
01:26:15,270 --> 01:26:16,936
I'll work for free a little,

1098
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:18,956
so please give me a job

1099
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:21,746
Don't say anything to me anymore

1100
01:26:21,770 --> 01:26:24,666
I've run out of my evening drink

1101
01:26:24,690 --> 01:26:28,627
It's quite a mystery that such a small factory has managed to survive until now,

1102
01:26:28,905 --> 01:26:29,998
But.

1103
01:26:30,378 --> 01:26:32,321
come on, there's no helping it

1104
01:26:33,148 --> 01:26:34,408
It can't be helped.

1105
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:42,043
Oh, someone is coming

1106
01:26:42,557 --> 01:26:43,365
For you, right?

1107
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:55,000
What's wrong? Do you need something?

1108
01:27:18,018 --> 01:27:19,456
Are you in Nagoya?

1109
01:27:27,954 --> 01:27:30,954
you're really far away, huh?

1110
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:34,320
I thought there wouldn't be any jobs in Tokyo,

1111
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:38,170
so I looked around, but all I found were jobs as hostesses at cabarets or maids at hot springs

1112
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:44,885
I don't really want to do that, but since I quit the hospital and decided to move, I thought I'd go along with it

1113
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,970
The person they call their late brother from Nagoya

1114
01:27:50,552 --> 01:27:51,948
So he really was a doctor

1115
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:54,980
I heard it's a big hospital

1116
01:27:55,780 --> 01:27:58,780
It seems that our teacher will take over from there

1117
01:27:59,579 --> 01:28:00,795
When are you going?

1118
01:28:00,820 --> 01:28:01,725
it's soon.

1119
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:08,478
then I guess I won't be able to see you

1120
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:12,543
I can't even take a break to come back once a month.

1121
01:28:13,987 --> 01:28:14,814
It's hard.

1122
01:28:20,136 --> 01:28:23,626
What will happen
to your factory?

1123
01:28:23,650 --> 01:28:24,548
I have no idea

1124
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:33,308
I sometimes write letters, so give me some too, okay?

1125
01:28:34,830 --> 01:28:37,830
Yeah, I promise,

1126
01:28:39,098 --> 01:28:40,205
Definitely.

1127
01:29:29,074 --> 01:29:30,300
Teacher.

1128
01:29:30,724 --> 01:29:32,444
Inoue teacher.

1129
01:29:35,399 --> 01:29:38,399
Please be quiet, I can't study

1130
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,754
What?

1131
01:29:42,181 --> 01:29:44,327
Everyone, calm down!

1132
01:29:46,051 --> 01:29:46,691
What's going on?

1133
01:29:46,899 --> 01:29:49,115
It's so noisy that I can't study
for our entrance exams

1134
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,426
Could you please be a little quieter?

1135
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,473
Who said that?

1136
01:29:51,856 --> 01:29:52,864
Miura teacher.

1137
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:09,002
Please value students who are working as well as students who are going on to higher education.

1138
01:30:12,898 --> 01:30:16,722
There are many people here who work after graduating from junior high school.

1139
01:30:17,573 --> 01:30:21,293
In the future, when you enter society, it's all good

1140
01:30:27,216 --> 01:30:30,518
Now, everyone, please begin.

1141
01:30:52,569 --> 01:30:53,582
Welcome back.

1142
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:55,133
It must have been cold.

1143
01:31:00,091 --> 01:31:01,804
It's snowing

1144
01:31:02,322 --> 01:31:03,975
I'm cooking now.

1145
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:30,209
What's wrong?

1146
01:31:35,183 --> 01:31:38,200
Children who got jobs must be having a hard time like this

1147
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:45,083
I received a letter from Arai who work at hospital

1148
01:31:50,325 --> 01:31:52,755
She's going to Nagoya with her master.

1149
01:31:52,780 --> 01:31:53,684
Really?

1150
01:31:57,507 --> 01:31:59,580
It seems Yuko has also
become an assistant at the inn

1151
01:32:08,650 --> 01:32:11,179
Tsuyoshi's repair shop is something wrong.

1152
01:32:13,052 --> 01:32:18,862
it feels like just yesterday
when everyone left with their hopes high.

1153
01:32:25,336 --> 01:32:30,499
The places where junior high school graduates get jobs are all just barely making ends meet

1154
01:32:32,530 --> 01:32:35,530
They say that when a department store opens in Fukushima,

1155
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,920
it causes a lot of retail businesses to collapse

1156
01:32:40,399 --> 01:32:42,266
What will Tsuyoshi do?

1157
01:32:50,528 --> 01:32:51,967
Are you going out?

1158
01:32:53,574 --> 01:32:54,567
I'll go to Tsuyoshi's place.

1159
01:32:54,929 --> 01:32:56,995
I heard that mom is sick, so I think I'll go visit her

1160
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:58,996
Make sure to eat your meal first

1161
01:32:59,020 --> 01:33:01,667
I come back right

1162
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:09,849
Aren't you going to eat anymore? The doctor said you should eat more.

1163
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:14,734
Good evening, teacher

1164
01:33:15,886 --> 01:33:17,612
Good evening

1165
01:33:18,450 --> 01:33:21,246
I wonder how she is.

1166
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:24,270
Her sickness haven't recovered for a long time

1167
01:33:24,759 --> 01:33:26,099
I wonder if Tsuyoshi-kun
will send a letter.

1168
01:33:26,204 --> 01:33:28,352
he hasn't said anything lately

1169
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:29,727
Come in.

1170
01:33:32,895 --> 01:33:34,725
Tsuyoshi's teacher is here.

1171
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:41,028
Ah, you have to sleep,
you can't be awake

1172
01:33:42,600 --> 01:33:45,600
That guy, Go-sensei

1173
01:33:46,279 --> 01:33:48,635
It's been nothing from Tsuyoshi lately

1174
01:33:48,660 --> 01:33:51,466
He can't really say anything about it

1175
01:33:51,490 --> 01:33:53,313
I wonder if something happened

1176
01:33:53,778 --> 01:33:55,519
He must be busy.

1177
01:33:56,736 --> 01:33:59,162
I think he's fine.

1178
01:33:59,935 --> 01:34:01,525
Don't worry.

1179
01:34:02,711 --> 01:34:03,490
Bring the tea.

1180
01:34:04,209 --> 01:34:05,165
It's fine, it's fine, I'm sorry

1181
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:08,337
Excuse me.

1182
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:06,814
How was it?

1183
01:35:07,306 --> 01:35:09,776
The director had been saying for a while that I should go breathe some fresh country air

1184
01:35:13,087 --> 01:35:14,747
The director said like that.

1185
01:35:16,660 --> 01:35:19,660
Speaking of Minoru Obara,

1186
01:35:20,050 --> 01:35:21,897
The doctor says it's quite serious

1187
01:35:22,140 --> 01:35:23,899
We are thinking of sending him back to the countryside

1188
01:35:24,494 --> 01:35:25,508
Will you fire him?

1189
01:35:25,810 --> 01:35:27,764
I'll use him again once he's better

1190
01:35:28,300 --> 01:35:30,761
But I don't think he will be better for a while

1191
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,425
It's not about the retirement bonus

1192
01:35:32,610 --> 01:35:33,706
If he lose his job,

1193
01:35:33,744 --> 01:35:35,805
he will be discouraging.

1194
01:35:35,830 --> 01:35:38,096
So, I thought I would use one of them

1195
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:39,550
since they had been asking me for a while

1196
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:42,196
Oh, what was your friend's name again?

1197
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:43,266
Is it Nishiyama-kun?

1198
01:35:43,290 --> 01:35:44,996
Hmm, is he still over there?

1199
01:35:45,020 --> 01:35:47,050
The auto repair shop

1200
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:09,530
hello, what is it?

1201
01:36:09,940 --> 01:36:11,405
Is this the Tsuyama repair shop?

1202
01:36:12,190 --> 01:36:15,190
Hello, is Tsuyoshi Nishiyama there?

1203
01:36:16,371 --> 01:36:18,420
Eh, Tsuyoshi?

1204
01:36:23,383 --> 01:36:26,189
You know, He's just out for work right now

1205
01:36:27,434 --> 01:36:31,726
He's going to get the vehicle inspection for the Auto mobile.

1206
01:36:53,549 --> 01:36:55,181
I'm glad I made it in time,

1207
01:36:55,206 --> 01:36:56,110
thank you

1208
01:36:56,791 --> 01:36:58,400
Our Factory...

1209
01:36:59,058 --> 01:36:59,595
What's wrong?

1210
01:36:59,620 --> 01:37:01,116
Kayo,come.

1211
01:37:07,240 --> 01:37:09,282
send me a letter

1212
01:37:48,384 --> 01:37:49,806
Inoue-teacher.

1213
01:37:51,103 --> 01:37:53,275
What's wrong?

1214
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:07,463
Mom,Teacher is here.

1215
01:38:11,181 --> 01:38:12,236
What's wrong?

1216
01:38:12,761 --> 01:38:19,329
She came on foot from the union.

1217
01:38:20,088 --> 01:38:23,205
She came on foot from the union.

1218
01:38:26,674 --> 01:38:28,650
Mom,Teacher is here.

1219
01:38:35,247 --> 01:38:45,025
Teacher,please take care of Tsuyoshi.

1220
01:38:47,134 --> 01:38:50,134
Ah, I see, I understand

1221
01:38:57,236 --> 01:38:58,322
hmm, the eldest son, huh?

1222
01:38:58,990 --> 01:39:00,706
So, how many family members are there?

1223
01:39:00,730 --> 01:39:01,166
Five

1224
01:39:03,946 --> 01:39:05,884
Well then, come right away starting today

1225
01:39:06,190 --> 01:39:07,266
Thank you in advance

1226
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:07,856
Do a great job.

1227
01:39:09,455 --> 01:39:10,080
This.

1228
01:39:10,493 --> 01:39:11,059
Well then, I'm going home now

1229
01:39:11,260 --> 01:39:12,806
Yes, that's right

1230
01:39:13,810 --> 01:39:16,810
Oh, you're Ishiyama-kun, aren't you?

1231
01:39:16,970 --> 01:39:18,346
Phone call from the previous factory

1232
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:20,525
Yes, I'm sorry

1233
01:39:20,660 --> 01:39:25,142
Hello, it's me

1234
01:39:26,990 --> 01:39:30,650
Huh, I just got a telegram now

1235
01:39:31,320 --> 01:39:33,026
I'm sorry.

1236
01:39:33,058 --> 01:39:37,392
Your mom has passed away, I'll read it again

1237
01:39:39,417 --> 01:39:41,759
Can you hear me?

1238
01:39:41,978 --> 01:39:44,705
Our mom is dead,Machie.

1239
01:39:45,197 --> 01:39:47,041
Can you hear me?

1240
01:39:48,205 --> 01:39:48,900
Yes

1241
01:39:49,111 --> 01:39:50,611
I'll hang up.

1242
01:40:00,415 --> 01:40:01,704
Is something wrong?

1243
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,546
No, it's nothing

1244
01:40:04,570 --> 01:40:06,716
Then hurry up and bring your luggage

1245
01:40:06,740 --> 01:40:07,779
Yeah

1246
01:40:51,525 --> 01:40:53,455
Tsuyoshi is coming from today?

1247
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:55,822
He's worried

1248
01:40:57,169 --> 01:40:59,103
Well, I suppose it's okay

1249
01:42:02,968 --> 01:42:04,337
They are practicing singing.

1250
01:42:04,362 --> 01:42:06,134
Is it already March?

1251
01:42:06,330 --> 01:42:08,689
It's been a year for us too.

1252
01:42:43,150 --> 01:42:44,416
Hey hurry up.

1253
01:42:44,939 --> 01:42:45,939
Reach.

1254
01:42:47,586 --> 01:42:48,941
How about this?

1255
01:42:48,994 --> 01:42:49,869
Reach.

1256
01:42:50,173 --> 01:42:51,966
Come on.

1257
01:42:52,963 --> 01:42:54,658
There's still a lot of chess left

1258
01:42:55,369 --> 01:42:56,580
I'm off to bed.

1259
01:42:57,405 --> 01:43:00,405
Hey, tomorrow you're the one who will boil the tea.

1260
01:43:07,102 --> 01:43:08,048
Hey Tsuyoshi

1261
01:43:09,009 --> 01:43:12,009
it would be nice if you went to bed too

1262
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:17,845
Here it is.

1263
01:43:18,761 --> 01:43:20,220
oh, thank you

1264
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:37,603
oh, is that you, Sensei?

1265
01:43:39,119 --> 01:43:40,392
Welcome.

1266
01:43:40,490 --> 01:43:41,931
I'm sorry for coming suddenly

1267
01:43:41,956 --> 01:43:43,025
Make a tea for him.

1268
01:43:43,050 --> 01:43:44,747
it's fine, it's fine

1269
01:43:53,993 --> 01:43:55,134
Tsuyoshi.

1270
01:44:00,002 --> 01:44:01,728
You saw the telegram, right?

1271
01:44:02,392 --> 01:44:03,174
Yes.

1272
01:44:04,588 --> 01:44:05,853
Why aren't you coming back?

1273
01:44:07,517 --> 01:44:12,580
Your mother died saying your name.

1274
01:44:13,804 --> 01:44:18,525
Forgive me....
I got a job here today.

1275
01:44:19,736 --> 01:44:21,377
I couldn't tell the factory manager about it.

1276
01:44:24,502 --> 01:44:26,166
I feel sorry for Mom.

1277
01:44:32,634 --> 01:44:36,213
I was afraid of losing my job.

1278
01:44:41,710 --> 01:44:44,536
What is it? Did you have something?

1279
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,246
I was able to talk to the factory manager.

1280
01:45:00,149 --> 01:45:01,689
Bus has arrived

1281
01:45:16,199 --> 01:45:17,419
Thank you very much for coming.

1282
01:45:17,485 --> 01:45:18,325
Thanks for your hard work.

1283
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:19,566
Welcome back.

1284
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:20,804
It's cold, isn't it?

1285
01:45:21,650 --> 01:45:23,325
Tokyo is already fully in spring

1286
01:45:23,949 --> 01:45:25,011
Hmm, I guess so.

1287
01:45:29,510 --> 01:45:30,657
how was Kiyoshi?

1288
01:45:31,421 --> 01:45:33,339
The telegram has arrived there.

1289
01:45:34,606 --> 01:45:37,136
It was just about to get a job at Gonzo's factory

1290
01:45:37,900 --> 01:45:40,900
He thought that he shouldn't bring it up because it might ruin his job.

1291
01:45:42,040 --> 01:45:42,940
Oh, I see

1292
01:45:44,550 --> 01:45:47,550
They are doing their best in their own way

1293
01:45:50,780 --> 01:45:57,127
Principal, Let me be your employment officer again this year.

1294
01:45:58,623 --> 01:46:00,790
Please

1295
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:03,433
Can you?

1296
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:04,140
Yes.

1297
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:06,393
Thank you very much.

1298
01:46:09,209 --> 01:46:10,096
Thank you very much.

1299
01:46:45,830 --> 01:46:49,195
Temporary employment train for Line 1 will depart

1300
01:46:51,554 --> 01:46:53,434
Please give my regard to the kids in Tokyo.

1301
01:46:54,526 --> 01:46:56,780
I'm counting on you again.

1302
01:46:59,248 --> 01:47:00,288
Have a safe trip.

1303
01:47:03,686 --> 01:47:05,697
Don't push yourself too hard.

1304
01:47:15,374 --> 01:47:17,340
I'll be off.

1305
01:48:10,165 --> 01:48:17,217
THE END

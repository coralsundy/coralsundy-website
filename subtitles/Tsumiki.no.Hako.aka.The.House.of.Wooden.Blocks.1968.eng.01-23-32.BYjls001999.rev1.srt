2
00:00:59,243 --> 00:01:01,837
You've been living in Asahikawa for three months now.

3
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:04,665
Ichiro,You like your new school?

4
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,423
I like it

5
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:13,094
No wonder.
HOKUEI. The junior high school is a prestigious private school with good facilities.

6
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:18,079
And our father is on the board of trustees with the largest endowment.
I'm sure you are in a good mood.

7
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,274
But Dad, why do we have to move all the time?

8
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:24,844
Sapporo to Hakodate
Hakodate to Muroran

9
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,868
Muroran to Otaru Otaru to Asahikawa

10
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,469
He never stays in the same place for more than three years.

11
00:01:30,923 --> 00:01:32,016
You're like a gypsy.

12
00:01:32,727 --> 00:01:36,837
Your father runs a lot of businesses in Hokkaido.

13
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:41,813
He lives in the town most convenient for his work at the time.

14
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:45,235
Parents are fine, but the kids are the worst off.

15
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:46,946
We're always moving from one school to another.

16
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:49,704
We're always in the middle of things with our boyfriends, and then we say goodbye.

17
00:01:50,219 --> 00:01:51,985
You don't like too, right?

18
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,251
I don't care

19
00:01:54,883 --> 00:02:00,087
You are carefree twenty-eight year old.

20
00:02:01,732 --> 00:02:03,138
You envy me?

21
00:02:09,698 --> 00:02:11,198
Sasabayashi here

22
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,604
Hold on

23
00:02:14,557 --> 00:02:17,565
Yuri kishima calls you

24
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:20,104
She has a beautiful voice,your girlfriend?

25
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:22,463
No, we're just classmates.

26
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:24,308
It's me

27
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:27,160
 in the park in front of my house?

28
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:29,738
Okay, I'll be right there.

29
00:02:37,377 --> 00:02:38,674
What's wrong?

30
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:44,338
Actually, I'm quitting school at the end of this semester.

31
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:46,564
Why?

32
00:02:47,572 --> 00:02:49,228
My father's a plasterer.

33
00:02:49,955 --> 00:02:53,619
He doesn't have any work during the winter, so he's always taking bets.

34
00:02:55,502 --> 00:03:00,853
He lost his gambling money this winter. To pay off his debt, he used all the money from his job.

35
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:04,033
Millions of yen of Sasabayashi Kanko's money.

36
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,674
My father's company?

37
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,721
If your father stares at him, he can't work in Asahikawa anymore.

38
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:14,580
That's why we are leaving town.

39
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:18,002
I'll ask my father to do something about it.

40
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:21,611
Wait,
Don't get me wrong

41
00:03:23,142 --> 00:03:25,017
I just wanted to talk to you,

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,686
Don't worry, my dad knows what he's talking about.

43
00:03:29,983 --> 00:03:32,686
Besides, it's Sunday. he is home.

44
00:03:33,373 --> 00:03:35,295
Go home and wait for me and I'll call you later.

45
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:36,889
Sasabayashi

46
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:41,904
Dad

47
00:03:56,075 --> 00:03:57,388
Dad, you there?

48
00:04:00,943 --> 00:04:01,818
Dad

49
00:04:10,428 --> 00:04:13,912
namie sis

50
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:14,598
Tsumiki no Hako / The House of Wooden Blocks (1968)

51
00:06:53,637 --> 00:06:56,996
Ichiro's not eating breakfast these days.
What's wrong with him?

52
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,762
It's not just breakfast, he doesn't even show up for dinner.

53
00:07:01,207 --> 00:07:05,559
I wonder what's going on with that girlfriend Shimayuri.

54
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,778
Namie,Chiro is not that stupid.

55
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:10,215
He's my child.

56
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:13,496
It's not like my son to fret over a girl.

57
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,824
I'm carrying on your chutzpah.

58
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:17,918
But that's okay.

59
00:07:18,356 --> 00:07:21,324
He's finally getting frustrated with his environment.

60
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:24,895
That's progress, and something to be proud of.

61
00:07:32,355 --> 00:07:35,551
Here you are, back of the Hokuei School.

62
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,950
Hello.
You're always early.

63
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:53,676
Bread and milk

64
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,184
Which bread will you have this morning?

65
00:07:56,997 --> 00:07:57,661
Anything.

66
00:07:58,255 --> 00:07:59,942
Cream bread is tasty

67
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:01,700
Don't say that

68
00:08:03,653 --> 00:08:04,630
I'll get a Cream bread

69
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,122
Thank you

70
00:08:09,177 --> 00:08:09,762
My change.

71
00:08:11,747 --> 00:08:13,512
But I heard you don't like bread.

72
00:08:14,098 --> 00:08:16,528
If you want, I can make you onigiri next time.

73
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,231
No thanks.

74
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:20,653
Good morning.

75
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:22,481
Give me 3 Onigiri

76
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:25,848
Three is too many every day.

77
00:08:26,434 --> 00:08:27,895
I want 3

78
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:31,458
Oh Sasabayashi

79
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,333
What's going on? so early, Sasabayashi?

80
00:08:34,755 --> 00:08:35,637
Sasabayashi

81
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:37,864
He's strange

82
00:08:38,497 --> 00:08:39,841
Sasabayashi?

83
00:08:40,802 --> 00:08:46,137
He's the son of Sasabayashi Goichi, who's the president of a number of Hokkaido tourist agencies, hotels, buses and countless other companies.

84
00:08:46,981 --> 00:08:49,567
He moved into my class this April from Otaru

85
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:52,052
He's got good grades for the son of a rich man.

86
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,411
What was he doing here?

87
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,530
Hisayo

88
00:08:59,835 --> 00:09:01,390
What was he doing here?

89
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,085
He just bought milk and bread.

90
00:09:15,326 --> 00:09:17,334
Who are you?
Get out

91
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,607
I'm in trouble!

92
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:19,599
What?

93
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:22,834
I'll always be here to catch the loach.

94
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,170
Get lost!

95
00:09:48,409 --> 00:09:49,416
What happened?

96
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:50,838
He drowned in the river.

97
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:53,354
I pulled him out and drained him.

98
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,846
are you okay?

99
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,510
I'm fine

100
00:09:58,327 --> 00:10:00,202
Thank you so much.

101
00:10:00,905 --> 00:10:02,530
I want to thank you

102
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,694
It's my fault.
I told him got out

103
00:10:21,074 --> 00:10:21,863
See you

104
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:24,246
See you

105
00:10:33,825 --> 00:10:39,614
You've been turning your head away and not talking to me at all lately

106
00:10:41,096 --> 00:10:43,424
My dad said He couldn’t about your dad.

107
00:10:44,753 --> 00:10:48,542
No worry.
When I told my mother about it, she scolded me.

108
00:10:49,206 --> 00:10:51,096
She said it's none of my business.

109
00:10:56,477 --> 00:11:01,648
It's strange.My body is such an adult and she said I am still child.

110
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,179
You look so naughty

111
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:13,990
Sasabayashi

112
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:16,928
You were shy about paying for it.

113
00:12:19,748 --> 00:12:22,959
I used to want to read it when I was at school.

114
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:27,771
It's normal to have an interest in it.

115
00:12:31,406 --> 00:12:32,554
Good thing it was me who found it.

116
00:12:32,976 --> 00:12:34,179
I'll take it back to the bookshop.

117
00:12:36,827 --> 00:12:38,327
Let's have a cup of tea around here.

118
00:12:39,085 --> 00:12:40,906
Sorry about the sermon.

119
00:12:54,401 --> 00:12:55,432
Ouch

120
00:13:33,964 --> 00:13:37,293
It's rare that you're in my house...

121
00:13:37,972 --> 00:13:39,793
Don't go into people's rooms.

122
00:13:40,394 --> 00:13:44,761
You've been acting so weird lately.
Why aren't you eating?

123
00:13:45,058 --> 00:13:46,824
I can't eat here. The food is terrible.

124
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:50,644
I've had better ramen outside or oyakodon.

125
00:13:51,488 --> 00:13:56,011
You don't look well and you've lost weight.
You're going to die soon.

126
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,324
I don't care if I die.
It's better than this house.

127
00:13:59,621 --> 00:14:03,011
What are you talking about? It's a perfect, luxurious house.

128
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:05,371
You'll be damned if you complain.

129
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:09,105
Shut up!
Get out!

130
00:14:09,597 --> 00:14:13,543
I can't.
We are brother

131
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:16,629
Be honest. Something's wrong.

132
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:18,496
Ichiro

133
00:14:20,941 --> 00:14:23,746
I tell you.
What's wrong about Namie ?

134
00:14:26,355 --> 00:14:30,097
She's our sister

135
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:35,496
She's not my sister, and if she was, she wouldn't be cuddling with my dad like a married couple.

136
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,566
That's not what parents do with their kids.

137
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,902
It could be incest.

138
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:43,644
I'm serious

139
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:47,097
What's wrong about Namie ?

140
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:50,808
I have no idea

141
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,339
She’s his mistress

142
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,050
She’s his mistress

143
00:15:00,449 --> 00:15:01,519
Don't you think so?

144
00:15:02,418 --> 00:15:04,644
That's a very good deduction.

145
00:15:05,746 --> 00:15:08,105
My father's a terrible man.

146
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:10,105
This is a beast's house.

147
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:12,691
Even our mother lies a lot.

148
00:15:14,574 --> 00:15:18,832
She's his mistress.
Our mother lies us

149
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:20,464
So what?

150
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,058
You know and you don't say a word.

151
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:25,941
Yeah

152
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:27,824
You don't care?

153
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:29,175
I care

154
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,496
Tell me what you think?

155
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:37,441
Adults are adults and children are children.

156
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:43,480
I make up my own world, and I keep it to myself.

157
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:47,129
I have to protect myself from dirty adults.

158
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,988
We can't live here

159
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:54,035
Don't play games with me, sister, they know what they're doing.

160
00:15:54,918 --> 00:16:00,480
If you're really mad at them, why don't you get that bitch out of here and clean house?

161
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:04,621
You think he'll listen to you?

162
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:07,410
They'll just laugh at you

163
00:16:09,074 --> 00:16:12,347
Ichiro,don't care about adults

164
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,191
You're an idiot for ruining your own life just because your parents are bad.

165
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,832
You are their side

166
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,941
I hate you

167
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,800
You're the one who's so twisted and filthy.

168
00:16:28,886 --> 00:16:31,863
Oh, I'm filthy. That's because I'm my father's son.

169
00:16:31,888 --> 00:16:35,441
You're blaming your parents for your filthiness.

170
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,394
If you're going to be filthy, why not be even filthier than your parents?

171
00:16:41,964 --> 00:16:44,714
Okay, it's getting worse and worse

172
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:47,441
I'll take Namie off our dad's hands.

173
00:16:48,558 --> 00:16:51,129
Don’t do that
You can't

174
00:16:52,082 --> 00:16:57,737
He's a beast cloth woman.
I'm the son of a beast.　We're just as good as each other.

175
00:17:00,405 --> 00:17:01,233
Who?

176
00:17:20,628 --> 00:17:22,847
What were you doing?

177
00:17:23,816 --> 00:17:27,495
We were talking about this house

178
00:17:28,925 --> 00:17:30,191
How's my grade?

179
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,581
80 points

180
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,238
Thanks

181
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,988
How's my grade?

182
00:17:40,972 --> 00:17:43,261
100 points.
You're great

183
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,456
Thanks

184
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,966
I wish I'd gotten a hundred, even if it was a lie.

185
00:17:51,044 --> 00:17:53,411
I haven't gotten a hundred since I was a kid.

186
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,309
Where are you going?

187
00:17:57,716 --> 00:18:01,138
Studying.
I'm still a senior in high school.

188
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,067
Next year I'm going to college.

189
00:18:03,372 --> 00:18:04,411
Don't make me laugh.

190
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,927
You play the guitar all the time.

191
00:18:07,528 --> 00:18:10,575
Your teacher... she specializes in math.

192
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,809
Maybe I'll get you a tutor.

193
00:18:13,177 --> 00:18:15,481
You're wasting my time.
Women are stupid.

194
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,403
You despise women?

195
00:18:19,122 --> 00:18:22,106
Your future wife is a woman.

196
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:31,283
I hate women.
Except for you

197
00:18:32,721 --> 00:18:35,822
You really like me?

198
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,681
That's nice of you.

199
00:18:44,325 --> 00:18:45,989
I'm sorry to bother you.

200
00:18:58,829 --> 00:18:59,586
Hi

201
00:19:03,993 --> 00:19:04,774
Welcome

202
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:06,680
How's he?

203
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,024
He's in bed with a fever, but he's fine.

204
00:19:11,055 --> 00:19:11,829
I wanna see you

205
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,961
Go ahead,he will be glad

206
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,539
I'm sorry, I got angry with you

207
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:31,016
If you'd like, you can stay for dinner.
I'll cook you a nice dinner.

208
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,360
I don’t care about my house

209
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,133
What do you like?

210
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:37,774
Anything.

211
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,352
leave it to me, then.

212
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,771
What should I cook

213
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:49,427
Only you and the little boy live here?

214
00:19:49,498 --> 00:19:50,060
Yeah

215
00:19:50,873 --> 00:19:52,982
I want a father

216
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,662
You shouldn't have that.

217
00:19:55,162 --> 00:19:56,670
It's enough for Mom.

218
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:59,888
He's a very lonely boy.

219
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:03,029
I'm sure he'd love to see you sometimes.

220
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:06,912
I'll come, but I enjoy it here more than at home.

221
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,373
Why is that?
Why? You have a fine house, don't you?

222
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:15,749
It looks fine on the outside, but it's not so nice on the inside.

223
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,281
They're all beasts of prey. It's like hell.

224
00:20:21,773 --> 00:20:23,320
It's like hell in there, whereas here it's heaven.

225
00:20:24,374 --> 00:20:29,163
You are sweet, your son is cute

226
00:20:29,835 --> 00:20:30,452
Hi

227
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:34,265
It's Sugiura
I'll be with you in a moment.

228
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:36,195
He's a frequent visitor, isn't he?

229
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:40,335
He always stops by on his way to and from school.

230
00:20:40,843 --> 00:20:41,617
For what?

231
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:44,710
He loves my son

232
00:20:58,245 --> 00:21:01,986
you haven't eaten dinner yet?
Please eat here

233
00:21:02,276 --> 00:21:07,643
I'd appreciate it.
But you are single mother. I worry about people's eye

234
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:11,252
Not tonight.
We have other guests.

235
00:21:12,456 --> 00:21:13,096
Who?

236
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:17,002
Sasabayashi from your class.

237
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,074
Where is he?

238
00:21:26,277 --> 00:21:27,941
He was out the back.

239
00:21:28,324 --> 00:21:29,340
He was out the back?

240
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,191
I don't know what's wrong.

241
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,113
It's because I'm here.
He's probably embarrassed.

242
00:21:37,449 --> 00:21:39,332
Anyway, I'll prepare your dinner.

243
00:22:26,882 --> 00:22:29,226
Good morning

244
00:22:36,214 --> 00:22:37,659
What's wrong?

245
00:22:38,292 --> 00:22:42,542
In your locker

246
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:50,627
Panties,bra,slip.

247
00:22:51,158 --> 00:22:53,049
These are so gorgeous

248
00:22:54,533 --> 00:22:57,072
That's probably the wrong locker for a female teacher.

249
00:22:58,041 --> 00:22:59,877
I'll hang it in the staff room.

250
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:13,494
Sasabayashi,Middle school is when you want to get into mischief.

251
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,423
Last year, I lost a lot of money when they delivered ten portions of sushi I didn't order.

252
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,697
Compared to that, this is still OK.

253
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:36,768
No, don't throw stones.

254
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:38,994
I won't care!

255
00:23:43,473 --> 00:23:45,778
Ichiro, it's a lie that you like me.

256
00:23:46,645 --> 00:23:47,934
You don't really like me.

257
00:23:48,332 --> 00:23:49,020
I do.

258
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:55,778
You used to hug me, bathe with me, spoil me.

259
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,785
Now you just stare at me with scary eyes.

260
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,926
I feel lonely

261
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:03,356
it's jealousy

262
00:24:04,738 --> 00:24:07,910
That's why I'm going to marry

263
00:24:09,965 --> 00:24:10,637
To where?

264
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,543
Taiwan.

265
00:24:13,105 --> 00:24:17,332
I heard that Taiwanese are very warm-hearted and respectful of the Japanese.

266
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:19,410
It's far

267
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,949
It's a four-hour flight from Haneda.

268
00:24:22,691 --> 00:24:24,980
If i don't think it's close, I won't go.

269
00:24:26,801 --> 00:24:28,223
You don't really want to go.

270
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,465
But I have to

271
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,403
Don't go to Taiwan as a bride, stay at home

272
00:24:38,834 --> 00:24:41,787
Then we'll be friends like old times?

273
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:43,576
Yeah

274
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:45,357
Really?

275
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:46,638
Sasabayashi

276
00:24:51,142 --> 00:24:53,110
It's Sunday and I've come for a home visit.

277
00:24:53,595 --> 00:24:55,470
There's no one at home.

278
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,580
He's in trouble.

279
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:02,690
Who are you?

280
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:04,596
I'm Ichiro's sister, Namie.

281
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,783
Please, come home. My mother will be with you.

282
00:25:18,757 --> 00:25:20,522
Leave your seat.

283
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:22,741
I've got an important meeting with him

284
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:25,483
Please drink A cold beer

285
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,022
No, thank you.

286
00:25:27,327 --> 00:25:29,225
Shall I get you a whiskey, then?

287
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:30,624
Or would you prefer a brandy?

288
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:36,772
Actually, Ichiro, his grades, which have been good ever since he transferred, have suddenly gone downhill.

289
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:41,406
His attitude is strange, and he doesn't eat at home.

290
00:25:43,211 --> 00:25:44,289
Is there a reason?

291
00:25:44,899 --> 00:25:49,781
There's no reason.
I think at that age they call it rebellion.

292
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:53,805
He's very difficult and doesn't talk to his parents.

293
00:25:54,297 --> 00:26:01,695
But it's like measles, he'll get over it eventually, so it's best to leave him alone.

294
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:06,117
Teacher,
I'm Ichiro's sister, Midori

295
00:26:06,297 --> 00:26:06,961
Nice to meet you

296
00:26:07,445 --> 00:26:08,516
I'm Sugiura

297
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:12,625
You can't ask my Mom anything.

298
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:20,375
She's too busy buying tea ceremony rings and kimonos.
She doesn't think about the kids at all.

299
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:23,633
Young girls these days are a real pain in the ass.

300
00:26:23,805 --> 00:26:26,524
She enjoys teasing their mothers.

301
00:26:26,945 --> 00:26:30,625
Mum, she can put up with anything as long as she has money.

302
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:35,485
She thinks that if she keeps her kids in the lap of luxury, they won't complain.

303
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:41,758
It's funny because she's giving a talk on home education at the women's club.

304
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:47,414
Besides, my mum's a very vain woman, and she'd never let our flaws out of the house.

305
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:52,390
But I'm the complete opposite, I'm a bit of an exhibitionist.

306
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:53,671
Cut it out

307
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:56,311
I like you so much.

308
00:26:57,093 --> 00:26:58,460
Will you teach me maths?

309
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,968
No, you won't.
He's too busy. He doesn't have time.

310
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:08,952
He's a good student, smart and charming enough.

311
00:27:08,977 --> 00:27:11,335
I don't tutor pretty girls.

312
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:14,538
you are a coward

313
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,729
Mum, what's he doing here?

314
00:27:39,331 --> 00:27:41,096
Why did you say that to the teacher?

315
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:43,128
What did you tell him?

316
00:27:45,899 --> 00:27:48,555
I heard you'd bought bread and milk and finished breakfast.

317
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:50,891
Don't be such a wretched wretch!

318
00:27:51,578 --> 00:27:53,399
Oh you talked about that

319
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,961
You'll definitely eat at home from now on.

320
00:27:56,352 --> 00:28:01,383
All right...
NAMIE's going to Taiwan as a bride?

321
00:28:02,894 --> 00:28:05,863
That's bullshit.
Who'd take her?

322
00:28:07,441 --> 00:28:12,074
Why, she's beautiful and kind.

323
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,910
She's not kind.
She has a completely different personality than she looks

324
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,011
She's kinder than Mom.

325
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,694
I'm sorry.
I had a miscarriage.

326
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:38,334
We've already had two
 Don't apologise to me.kids.

327
00:28:39,311 --> 00:28:43,694
Your body is more important.
You'll stay here for the time being.

328
00:28:45,344 --> 00:28:51,719
This girl, I think it's her, used to work in a bar in Noboribetsu, but she's only 15.

329
00:28:52,548 --> 00:28:55,266
It's against the law, so I scolded owner and took her in.

330
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:57,735
Why don't you let her help you with the housework?

331
00:28:58,157 --> 00:28:59,352
That's fine

332
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,829
What kind of parents would let their little girl work like this?

333
00:29:04,298 --> 00:29:07,790
Sounds like an orphan.
Her uncle sold her off.

334
00:29:09,407 --> 00:29:10,923
I feel sorry

335
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,693
You slept with our housemade

336
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:54,092
I'm going home country

337
00:29:55,264 --> 00:29:59,717
I thought you were the only one who understood what I was talking about, so you're a normal woman after all.

338
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,514
It's ok if we divorce

339
00:30:03,686 --> 00:30:05,904
I'll take my kids.

340
00:30:06,264 --> 00:30:08,615
I won't leave them in the hands of a father who looks like an animal.

341
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:11,435
Yes I am an animal

342
00:30:11,865 --> 00:30:15,561
animals kill for their children

343
00:30:16,053 --> 00:30:18,545
I'll take my kids.

344
00:30:20,772 --> 00:30:22,607
I'll kill you

345
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,459
I'll kill you

346
00:30:26,654 --> 00:30:29,514
Toki,You are a proud woman.

347
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:33,725
You want to be the laughing stock of the world when your master is taken by the HOUSEMAIDE?

348
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:38,787
You should be respected as my wife.

349
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:45,591
Namie will be our child.
Other two kids are still small

350
00:30:46,139 --> 00:30:48,568
I can't trick them

351
00:30:49,662 --> 00:30:54,084
In exchange, I'll give you the luxury of buying all the jewellery stores and kimonos you like.

352
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:19,335
Good evening

353
00:31:19,913 --> 00:31:21,249
Oh you

354
00:31:21,624 --> 00:31:23,984
I asked at the lodge, but they said you'd be on duty tonight.

355
00:31:24,343 --> 00:31:25,796
So I rushed over immediately.

356
00:31:26,265 --> 00:31:27,148
What do you want?

357
00:31:27,944 --> 00:31:30,773
I have something important to discuss with you.

358
00:31:33,452 --> 00:31:34,577
What's about?

359
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:42,640
What if... my dad has a mistress and they live in the same house?

360
00:31:44,793 --> 00:31:48,762
Either I'll snub the bitch out, or I'll run away from home myself.

361
00:31:49,676 --> 00:31:55,691
Or I'll leave him to make an example of his stupid father, and I'll become a MISTRESS too.

362
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,498
Or I'll kill myself.

363
00:31:58,523 --> 00:31:59,897
is that the important thing you're talking about?

364
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:04,490
You're so insensitive... didn't you see my sister?

365
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:06,553
She's Father's Mistress

366
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,553
She's Father's Mistress

367
00:32:11,084 --> 00:32:14,287
I mean, my family lives with the MISTRESS.

368
00:32:15,061 --> 00:32:15,920
I see

369
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:19,433
So that's why Ichiro is in trouble

370
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:21,754
I found out when I was in primary school.

371
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:23,933
He's so easygoing.

372
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:26,925
He's just now realising and floundering.

373
00:32:27,316 --> 00:32:29,058
He's at a bad age to find out.

374
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:32,637
But it's a secret.

375
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:37,551
I extort tens of thousands of dollars a month in hush money from my mum.

376
00:32:38,363 --> 00:32:40,457
It's okay. I'm tight-lipped.

377
00:32:41,582 --> 00:32:47,434
I've got a bastard of a father to thank for that.
I've learned the ins and outs of the male animal.

378
00:32:49,879 --> 00:32:52,418
Secondary school teachers are the worst of the worst.

379
00:32:53,098 --> 00:33:01,793
They're quick to touch a female student's bottom or breasts, but you're the exception.
A beautiful girl like me could seduce you and you wouldn't even hold my hand.

380
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,840
I like you even more now.

381
00:33:11,627 --> 00:33:13,978
Sasabayashi It's almost summer holiday.

382
00:33:14,885 --> 00:33:16,447
Not for me.

383
00:33:17,416 --> 00:33:22,900
There's a camp from Lake Akan to Lake Kussharo during the summer holidays.
Three days, two nights.

384
00:33:23,533 --> 00:33:25,697
I'm not interested in that.

385
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,744
But I'd really like you to go.

386
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:30,033
Why?

387
00:33:30,853 --> 00:33:34,330
My mother said it's my last camp in junior high and I should attend.

388
00:33:35,439 --> 00:33:38,502
After that, we are leaving Asahikawa.

389
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,799
That's why I want you to go with me.

390
00:33:42,807 --> 00:33:43,510
I don't want to.

391
00:33:51,556 --> 00:33:53,813
About Summer Camp Exposure ,Have you made up your mind?

392
00:33:55,313 --> 00:34:00,704
I'm sure the food will be delicious and Our students will be delighted to have you overseeing the cooking.

393
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,054
Can I bring Kazuo?

394
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:04,976
Sure

395
00:34:06,624 --> 00:34:12,991
Usually it's the teacher's family, but I'm single, and a friend I was counting on is ill.

396
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:17,740
I'll go.
he'll be so happy.

397
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:20,716
We haven't been away in years.

398
00:34:20,982 --> 00:34:24,654
Well, thank goodness, 'cause this is gonna be a fun camping trip.

399
00:34:33,056 --> 00:34:36,431
You like him?

400
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:41,478
I like most people.

401
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:43,275
Are you getting married?

402
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:48,619
No way, I have Kazuo

403
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:53,971
Don't get along with him.
I hate him

404
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,353
But he's your customer, he buys cigarettes from you every day.

405
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:01,033
I have to be friendly.

406
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:04,603
I'm a customer, too,

407
00:35:05,658 --> 00:35:06,619
But not you.

408
00:35:07,283 --> 00:35:10,017
You've saved Kazuo's life.

409
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:13,821
I like you

410
00:35:15,649 --> 00:35:16,985
What did you tell him about?

411
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,141
We're going to the summer camp too.

412
00:35:21,126 --> 00:35:24,634
We'd love it if you'd play with Kazuo while we're away.

413
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,102
Will you come?

414
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,095
Yes

415
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:53,956
Don't you sing?

416
00:36:32,419 --> 00:36:37,122
Actually, I've been wanting to ask you for a while.

417
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,427
when did KAZUO father die?

418
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:44,747
Five years ago, when he was born,

419
00:36:45,973 --> 00:36:49,434
You chose him.
He must have been a fine man.

420
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:56,434
You didn't remarry because you couldn't forget your late husband.

421
00:36:57,223 --> 00:37:02,552
Quite the opposite.
It was too hard for me. I'll never marry again.

422
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:06,770
If that were true, I'd want to marry you

423
00:37:07,763 --> 00:37:14,051
I'm a 30-year-old bachelor, generally decent.
I'm confident I could make you happy.

424
00:37:15,247 --> 00:37:18,028
I'm confident I can make you happy and be a good father to Kazuo.

425
00:37:20,395 --> 00:37:21,770
Will you marry me?

426
00:37:24,888 --> 00:37:28,239
I'm not the kind of woman who can be your wife.

427
00:37:29,442 --> 00:37:32,333
I'd like to know why.

428
00:37:35,903 --> 00:37:38,083
I'm sure we'll have a chance to talk about it one day.

429
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:53,388
I feel good.
Why don't you lie down?

430
00:37:56,629 --> 00:37:57,473
Like this?

431
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:01,090
Meditate with me.

432
00:38:02,371 --> 00:38:03,035
Why are you doing this?

433
00:38:03,668 --> 00:38:04,605
Come on.

434
00:38:08,613 --> 00:38:11,746
We'll never see each other again.

435
00:38:12,824 --> 00:38:13,481
So?

436
00:38:14,004 --> 00:38:19,652
I have to admit, I really love you

437
00:38:20,973 --> 00:38:23,911
Kiss me

438
00:38:25,817 --> 00:38:30,879
I'll never see you again in the ninth grade.
I want to make happy memories.

439
00:38:44,785 --> 00:38:46,543
No, I can't.

440
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:53,948
Unload my stuff.

441
00:39:01,011 --> 00:39:02,261
Damn it

442
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,144
Sasabayashi

443
00:39:08,113 --> 00:39:10,378
Hello, teacher

444
00:39:11,871 --> 00:39:13,738
I took of your photo

445
00:39:13,996 --> 00:39:16,980
Oh Midori, she is Ichiro's sister

446
00:39:18,047 --> 00:39:18,945
Ichiro's sister?

447
00:39:24,961 --> 00:39:26,945
Who's the pretty woman?

448
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,179
The wife of the milkman in front of the school.

449
00:39:30,968 --> 00:39:35,828
That's where Ichiro gets his bread.
I bet you're in love with her.

450
00:39:36,187 --> 00:39:37,992
there is a lot of age difference

451
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,781
There's no age between a man and a woman.

452
00:39:41,969 --> 00:39:42,929
You like her too, don't you?

453
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:45,929
But I don't like her. She's my rival.

454
00:39:46,961 --> 00:39:48,297
Why did you come here?

455
00:39:49,062 --> 00:39:50,328
I came here with my dad to visit him in labour.

456
00:39:50,711 --> 00:39:51,969
His Mistress is here too

457
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:56,492
He's a terrible father, isn't he?

458
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:58,859
That's a nice car.

459
00:40:07,475 --> 00:40:09,389
Hi,I'm Sasabayashi

460
00:40:09,912 --> 00:40:11,889
I know it's embarrassing, but please give it to your students.

461
00:40:12,748 --> 00:40:14,654
Chocolate, gum and juice.

462
00:40:15,701 --> 00:40:17,568
Thanks

463
00:40:18,201 --> 00:40:20,295
You're a smart kid, aren't you?

464
00:40:22,646 --> 00:40:23,451
How old are you?

465
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,396
5 years old

466
00:40:25,889 --> 00:40:27,295
You're heavy

467
00:40:29,865 --> 00:40:33,209
Dad, I've never seen you hold a child before in my life.

468
00:40:33,623 --> 00:40:35,810
Give me a break

469
00:40:36,623 --> 00:40:38,631
Now, excuse me.
I'm on my way to work.

470
00:40:41,588 --> 00:40:48,681
I'm leaving Sapporo tomorrow for Tokyo, Osaka and possibly Kyushu.Bye.

471
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:06,260
You went all the way from Tokyo to Kyushu and these are your travel photos?

472
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,143
They're all of men's faces.

473
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,924
I'm more interested in men than scenery.
I've taken every face I've liked.

474
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:16,174
I'm disgusted with you

475
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:19,549
Why?
I'm seriously thinking about marriage.

476
00:41:20,509 --> 00:41:23,291
I don't want to be single forever like Namie.

477
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:25,744
I'll have a family by the time I'm twenty-three.

478
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:28,838
I envy you.

479
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:33,056
A woman's happiness depends on the kind of person she lives with

480
00:41:33,916 --> 00:41:37,338
No matter how much money and power you have, if he's a weirdo, you're screwed for life.

481
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,330
That's why I look at all kinds of men, to keep my eyes open.

482
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,603
But then, they're all boring men, aren't they?

483
00:41:44,666 --> 00:41:48,752
They're all so bossy, even though they're on a low salary.

484
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:51,634
What's with the picture?

485
00:41:54,244 --> 00:41:57,978
Oh, You forgot?, it's Ichiro's teacher.

486
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:00,189
No, I mean this woman

487
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:03,588
This is Ichiro's favourite milkman's wife.

488
00:42:04,127 --> 00:42:06,189
She's one of the few beauties around here.

489
00:42:07,181 --> 00:42:09,166
Oh I see

490
00:42:09,939 --> 00:42:11,056
She's beautiful

491
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:14,134
Don't act weird, OK?

492
00:42:14,931 --> 00:42:18,752
She's the mom who you slept with

493
00:42:42,774 --> 00:42:46,477
Dad, what are you looking at?

494
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,938
That woman from the milkman's shop.

495
00:42:49,532 --> 00:42:53,352
I think she's the one who used to be my secretary in Otaru.

496
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:56,243
Oh she is

497
00:42:57,493 --> 00:43:00,587
I’m sure she is

498
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:06,791
You're right, she looks just like her.

499
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:10,541
Then maybe the kid's mine.

500
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,338
Have you slept with her?

501
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,674
Just once

502
00:43:15,221 --> 00:43:16,705
Then I left

503
00:43:17,971 --> 00:43:21,221
I can't believe it.
she had a baby.

504
00:43:22,627 --> 00:43:25,151
I can't believe but this is true

505
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:28,440
You still love her

506
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:30,565
I like

507
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:32,947
More than I?

508
00:43:33,651 --> 00:43:38,213
I've kept you for 13 years.
There's no comparison.

509
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:44,518
Tomorrow I'm going to Tokyo for a week, and tonight I'm going to treat you well.

510
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:50,106
Sex in a room next to my wife, makes me exciting

511
00:44:36,613 --> 00:44:37,542
Welcome

512
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:41,292
Any chocolate is fine
Give me 2 dozen.

513
00:44:42,566 --> 00:44:44,402
Thank you very much.

514
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:50,332
You run the shop all by yourself?

515
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:53,613
Does your husband work somewhere?

516
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:55,972
schoolteacher?

517
00:44:57,082 --> 00:44:58,613
I don't have a husband.

518
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:03,683
No husband,but you have a kid?

519
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:07,214
He passed  away

520
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:15,964
A boy called Ichiro Sasabayashi comes here often?

521
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:16,480
Yes

522
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:18,464
For what?

523
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:22,566
He loves my kid
Kazuo will be very happy.

524
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:25,855
You’re lying.
You're the one who's happy.

525
00:45:29,194 --> 00:45:33,491
Your kid is Sasabayashi Goichi's , isn't he?

526
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,522
No

527
00:45:35,921 --> 00:45:37,217
Be honest

528
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:43,921
Excuse me, but what exactly is your relationship to Sasabayashi?

529
00:45:45,522 --> 00:45:47,124
I'll tell you if you want to know.

530
00:45:49,303 --> 00:45:51,124
I'm his mistress

531
00:45:53,553 --> 00:45:55,452
I know what's on your mind

532
00:45:56,835 --> 00:45:59,124
You want to get money from him for the child.

533
00:46:02,577 --> 00:46:04,686
You've got it all wrong.

534
00:46:05,842 --> 00:46:07,616
I don't want money

535
00:46:08,444 --> 00:46:11,991
What the hell?
I am your customer

536
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,733
I know what's on your mind

537
00:46:16,631 --> 00:46:20,131
You want to control Ichiro and get back together with him again.

538
00:46:20,788 --> 00:46:23,092
I know you do.

539
00:46:26,816 --> 00:46:29,246
I can't talk to you.
Please go home

540
00:46:29,637 --> 00:46:30,809
You can't fake it.

541
00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:32,988
Remember...

542
00:46:34,714 --> 00:46:38,534
As long as I'm here, you'll never get your way.

543
00:46:43,394 --> 00:46:46,097
I caught 5 loaches

544
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,910
Good for you.

545
00:46:52,191 --> 00:46:54,730
Hello, Ichiro.

546
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:58,988
This is no place for you.

547
00:46:59,668 --> 00:47:00,761
Go home

548
00:47:04,043 --> 00:47:05,770
Get out

549
00:47:48,474 --> 00:47:49,755
What are you doing here?

550
00:47:53,602 --> 00:47:55,711
You pushed me away today?

551
00:47:57,008 --> 00:48:00,031
You know, because you are dad's mistress

552
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:03,612
Oh you knew

553
00:48:04,455 --> 00:48:06,299
Of course I do, don't make fun of me.

554
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,656
You hate me?

555
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:14,234
I can't even look at it.

556
00:48:15,015 --> 00:48:18,906
You're lying.
You really like me, don't you?

557
00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:23,710
Get out or I'll push you away again.

558
00:48:28,046 --> 00:48:31,210
If you want me to leave, fine.

559
00:48:33,742 --> 00:48:37,375
I haven't had a home here since I was born.

560
00:48:37,687 --> 00:48:38,984
I don't know anything about that,

561
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:45,262
I'm a headword.

562
00:48:48,481 --> 00:48:51,051
I grew up being sold from bar to bar.

563
00:48:53,161 --> 00:48:57,879
I was always beaten up and yelled at for breaking a double plate.

564
00:48:59,268 --> 00:49:01,487
They always told me to get out

565
00:49:02,237 --> 00:49:03,503
So what?

566
00:49:06,464 --> 00:49:09,792
He's the only one who's ever stood up for me.

567
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:15,229
I came to this house thinking I'd be a good maid, and I was so happy

568
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,163
But he suddenly attacked me

569
00:49:20,671 --> 00:49:22,976
I don't want to hear about it.

570
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:31,456
Ichiro, a child without parents... Any kind of human affection makes us happy.

571
00:49:33,816 --> 00:49:35,636
I loved your father.

572
00:49:37,566 --> 00:49:40,753
Is that bad for me?

573
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:43,495
Of course you are

574
00:49:45,644 --> 00:49:48,074
But I wasn't a bad girl from the start.

575
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,214
I've been a bad girl for a long time.

576
00:49:55,913 --> 00:49:57,140
I was comfortable.

577
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:01,874
I've been in this house too long...

578
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:07,796
But I have to leave

579
00:50:09,601 --> 00:50:12,046
People are suffering because of me.

580
00:50:14,648 --> 00:50:16,632
I'm scared of the outside world.

581
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:23,983
I'll be bullied and beaten up again, and I'll have a bad time, of course I will.

582
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:29,148
But it's my destiny

583
00:50:30,937 --> 00:50:32,000
Right?

584
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:38,594
I like you.
Kiss me goodbye.

585
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:42,601
Kiss me goodbye.

586
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:45,781
You don't like neither?

587
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:50,210
You hate me so much?

588
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:58,265
See you

589
00:51:01,804 --> 00:51:03,593
Stay here

590
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:05,914
It's my dad who's the bad

591
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:10,547
But I can't hate him.
He saved my life.

592
00:51:11,093 --> 00:51:14,843
You're an idiot, you know that?
I don't care if you killed him.

593
00:51:15,195 --> 00:51:17,008
It's just that he messed up your life

594
00:51:17,664 --> 00:51:23,758
If you hadn't picked me up, I'd be a plaything for a lot of guys right now.

595
00:51:23,992 --> 00:51:25,937
I don't think so

596
00:51:25,962 --> 00:51:27,156
You are wrong

597
00:51:27,181 --> 00:51:28,164
I'm right

598
00:51:55,626 --> 00:51:56,587
Smells good.

599
00:51:57,977 --> 00:51:59,071
Smells like Milk

600
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:01,970
you are a lily flower

601
00:52:17,226 --> 00:52:18,538
What do you think of this dress?

602
00:52:20,695 --> 00:52:22,101
It looks good on you.

603
00:52:25,328 --> 00:52:26,617
I'm so happy.

604
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:31,007
You are bad

605
00:52:31,656 --> 00:52:32,585
Why?

606
00:52:33,171 --> 00:52:35,921
You slept me and my dad

607
00:52:36,968 --> 00:52:41,671
You're idiot.
I only like Ichiro.

608
00:52:42,663 --> 00:52:47,163
we cuddled every night for a week until morning.

609
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,132
But when he comes home tonight..

610
00:52:55,890 --> 00:52:56,882
What's wrong ?

611
00:52:57,796 --> 00:52:59,070
You're idiot.

612
00:53:00,328 --> 00:53:06,515
If you're so suspicious, keep an eye on me all night.

613
00:53:07,078 --> 00:53:08,843
Of course you are going.

614
00:53:09,703 --> 00:53:12,484
I'm not going there.
I swear to you.

615
00:53:13,421 --> 00:53:16,460
If you betray me, I don't know what I'll do.

616
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:17,788
All right.

617
00:53:19,843 --> 00:53:22,632
You're the one who's suspicious.

618
00:53:22,788 --> 00:53:23,288
What?

619
00:53:24,429 --> 00:53:27,343
The milkman's wife, Hisayo... you like her, don't you?

620
00:53:30,687 --> 00:53:32,319
Have you ever been held like this?

621
00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:34,210
No way

622
00:53:36,938 --> 00:53:40,390
Which one do you like more?

623
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:42,664
You're both beautiful.

624
00:53:43,446 --> 00:53:45,055
She's kind

625
00:53:46,328 --> 00:53:46,977
me?

626
00:53:48,743 --> 00:53:50,477
I'm scared.

627
00:53:55,863 --> 00:53:58,402
Don't go out with her.

628
00:53:58,879 --> 00:53:59,473
Why?

629
00:54:00,957 --> 00:54:03,387
You'll regret it one day.

630
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:26,328
Give me this knife.

631
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:43,687
It's rare to see Ichiro at home, what's going on?

632
00:54:44,523 --> 00:54:47,305
He's finally grown up after his rebellion.

633
00:54:49,211 --> 00:54:53,320
The only thing that's grown up is his body.
He looked at the girls funny,

634
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:56,070
and even got cheeky with his moustache.

635
00:54:56,617 --> 00:54:57,320
Shut up

636
00:56:19,202 --> 00:56:21,566
Namie, are you there?

637
00:56:25,077 --> 00:56:26,045
Where'd she go?

638
00:56:44,264 --> 00:56:45,303
Namie

639
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:54,524
Oh, my God, you're here.

640
00:57:06,898 --> 00:57:09,554
Oh, shit.
I didn't know you had this trick up your sleeve.

641
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:14,554
About this?

642
00:57:16,058 --> 00:57:18,246
Your mum had them made.

643
00:57:19,316 --> 00:57:20,847
It's a publicity stunt.

644
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:22,957
My Mom?

645
00:57:24,121 --> 00:57:27,183
He moves all the time for the sake of publicity.

646
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:31,738
He moves to another city as soon as he thinks my cover is blown.

647
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,957
It's all your mother's idea.

648
00:57:34,566 --> 00:57:36,925
I don't care about any of that, sister.

649
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:41,433
You cheated on me and slept with Daddy, you liar.

650
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:50,661
I don't have a choice.
I don't want to do what you want me to do, either.

651
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:53,576
If I refuse, he'll kill you.

652
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,146
Don't make a lie

653
00:57:55,552 --> 00:57:57,466
He's scary

654
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,130
You can't just run away from this house.

655
00:58:01,537 --> 00:58:03,435
He'll find you. Hell kill you half to death.

656
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,466
Don't make a lie.
You wanna stay with him,right?

657
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:09,412
Why?

658
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:12,913
why do I want this life?

659
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:16,890
I'm never married, never free to play with my boyfriend.

660
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:21,741
I'm always cooped up in the house. It's like prison.

661
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:23,624
Shut up.

662
00:58:28,874 --> 00:58:30,312
You kill me?

663
00:58:32,906 --> 00:58:35,281
Ok, kill me

664
00:58:37,484 --> 00:58:39,843
If it makes you feel better.

665
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:43,906
Someday somebody's going to kill me anyway.

666
00:58:45,929 --> 00:58:46,851
kill me

667
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,257
What's the matter with you?
You can't kill me?

668
00:58:56,976 --> 00:58:58,733
If you don't do something, just get out.

669
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:00,593
Damn it

670
00:59:00,718 --> 00:59:02,952
What are you doing?

671
00:59:07,296 --> 00:59:08,858
This is my dad's mistress room.

672
00:59:10,522 --> 00:59:11,624
Get out

673
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:19,018
Stop trying to seduce Ichiro

674
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:20,910
seduce ?

675
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:27,144
You're overreacting, I'm just taking a little something from HISAYO.

676
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,691
He's a 15 year old kid.
Don't play with him.

677
00:59:31,511 --> 00:59:36,652
I turned him into a full-fledged adult.
You should be thanking me.

678
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:40,402
Shame on you.
If you ever lay a hand on him again, I'll never forgive you.

679
00:59:41,246 --> 00:59:44,886
You've got to be kidding me.
He interested in me

680
00:59:46,128 --> 00:59:50,261
If I'd come out of daddy's room...
He would have killed me.

681
00:59:50,605 --> 00:59:54,769
He would have killed you, but you got what you deserved.
You messed this house up.

682
00:59:54,794 --> 00:59:56,839
Sorry... it's not my fault.

683
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:58,769
Blame on your dad

684
00:59:59,347 --> 01:00:00,878
He's just an animal

685
01:00:02,035 --> 01:00:03,847
But he's an animal who plays with animals.

686
01:00:03,872 --> 01:00:08,871
So Ichiro is also an animal.
He slept with me

687
01:00:09,621 --> 01:00:13,316
He's my daddy's boy.

688
01:00:14,378 --> 01:00:15,871
You too ,Midori

689
01:00:16,433 --> 01:00:17,136
Why?

690
01:00:17,832 --> 01:00:20,402
You chase men's asses all year round.

691
01:00:21,011 --> 01:00:22,355
How do you know what you're doing?

692
01:00:22,425 --> 01:00:24,464
I'm not like you

693
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:27,277
Your idea is too old

694
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:33,089
These days, there are plenty of young ladies who fall in love with married men and destroy their families.

695
01:00:33,114 --> 01:00:36,339
What are you talking about?
You like money.

696
01:00:37,042 --> 01:00:38,957
You can't stop living in the lap of luxury.

697
01:00:38,982 --> 01:00:42,308
You don't know what's going to happen to you either.

698
01:00:43,121 --> 01:00:45,410
You might be 4th mistress

699
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:48,605
Don't worry.
I'm not like you

700
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:54,363
But what if they forcefully manhandle you like they did me?

701
01:00:55,245 --> 01:00:56,729
I'd die.

702
01:00:57,347 --> 01:00:58,800
Your idea is too old

703
01:00:59,675 --> 01:01:06,308
If I were you, I'd let Dad be Dad and Ichiro be Ichiro.
I'd get along with both of them.

704
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,417
That's not funny.

705
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:11,878
Ichiro, I can't believe you'd let a woman like this go to you.You are still baby

706
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:13,121
I'm not

707
01:01:13,146 --> 01:01:15,886
You are.
Mind and body are disconnected.

708
01:01:16,738 --> 01:01:19,699
Your heart loves Hisayo, but Your  body loves this woman.

709
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:25,714
A real grown-up loves a woman with both body and soul.

710
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:28,988
Daddy's girl is disgusting.
She's like rotten tomatoes.

711
01:01:30,425 --> 01:01:35,574
I tell you but I'm not his only woman

712
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:37,878
There's another woman.

713
01:01:38,417 --> 01:01:38,996
Who?

714
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:42,660
Hisayo.
Ichiro's favorite woman

715
01:01:43,277 --> 01:01:44,082
What?

716
01:01:44,621 --> 01:01:48,949
That little boy you're loving so much. Your beloved Kazuo... that's father's son.

717
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:52,902
Congratulations.
You've got your brother

718
01:01:53,988 --> 01:01:55,488
That's bullshit.

719
01:01:57,238 --> 01:02:00,644
You can't beat me up all you want.
Facts are facts.

720
01:02:01,253 --> 01:02:03,589
If you doubt me so much, ask Hisako.

721
01:02:03,871 --> 01:02:04,628
Shut up

722
01:02:12,409 --> 01:02:15,386
Thank you for your kindness.

723
01:02:15,488 --> 01:02:16,238
You are welcome

724
01:02:16,425 --> 01:02:18,964
I'm sure I'll be able to repay you.

725
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:22,527
I'll be waiting.

726
01:02:36,164 --> 01:02:42,250
Sir, I'm sorry to bother you on duty, but can Kazuo stay at school tonight?

727
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:44,305
No problem.
Why?

728
01:02:45,235 --> 01:02:52,477
Summer vacation will be over soon, a
I'm going to a wholesale store in Sapporo to stock up!

729
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:54,766
You are busy

730
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:57,774
Hisayo

731
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:00,891
What's going on with you?

732
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,157
Kazuo is my father's son?

733
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:10,984
No

734
01:03:11,594 --> 01:03:12,703
I knew it.

735
01:03:14,343 --> 01:03:19,984
I thought you were the only one I trusted.

736
01:03:20,938 --> 01:03:22,250
All women are bullshit.

737
01:03:23,047 --> 01:03:24,406
I'm not bullshit.

738
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:26,141
Whose child is that?

739
01:03:27,578 --> 01:03:29,172
My own child.

740
01:03:29,602 --> 01:03:32,578
How can a woman have a child on her own?

741
01:03:34,063 --> 01:03:37,719
I bet you smiled when you saw me playing with him

742
01:03:40,643 --> 01:03:44,018
I'll tell you the truth.

743
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:46,948
Please listen to me

744
01:03:49,557 --> 01:03:54,097
I'm going to tell you the truth about my past for the first time.

745
01:03:54,268 --> 01:03:57,425
You're all lying.

746
01:03:57,450 --> 01:04:00,291
Shut up.Sasabayashi

747
01:04:02,753 --> 01:04:04,690
Five years ago.

748
01:04:06,034 --> 01:04:11,112
I was living in Otaru and working as Sasabayashi's secretary.

749
01:04:13,511 --> 01:04:20,682
My father was an accountant for a company
One of his subordinates misappropriated 700,000 yen.

750
01:04:22,218 --> 01:04:25,640
To fill the hole, my father became neurotic.

751
01:04:26,804 --> 01:04:29,296
And my mother became seriously ill.

752
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,382
Then I told Sasabayashi everything

753
01:04:36,507 --> 01:04:40,194
He told me He gave cheque so come to restraint

754
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:11,320
I was raped

755
01:05:12,181 --> 01:05:14,068
And the check went to waste.

756
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:17,357
Dad

757
01:05:19,037 --> 01:05:21,045
Why did you die?

758
01:05:21,795 --> 01:05:22,951
Dad

759
01:05:41,295 --> 01:05:45,835
When I got home, I found my father had committed suicide.

760
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:51,680
My mother died three days later from the shock.

761
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:59,531
So that one night, one time, that's all it took to give birth to KAZUO?

762
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:09,226
I didn't want to give birth, but the child is innocent.
I couldn't kill him.

763
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:15,501
I gave birth while working as a maid at an inn in Obihiro.

764
01:06:16,283 --> 01:06:20,619
Hisayo, you're too serious like your father.

765
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:27,619
My own children are adorable and I can't let them go.

766
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:36,423
I borrowed money from the innkeeper to raise him and start this restaurant.

767
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:40,642
So he's my brother after all.

768
01:06:42,439 --> 01:06:44,298
I'm sorry.

769
01:06:45,931 --> 01:06:48,001
I didn't mean to cheat you.

770
01:06:49,783 --> 01:06:56,806
Poor Kazuo, he has no father.
I thought at least his real brother would take care of him.

771
01:06:58,456 --> 01:07:04,424
Auntie, I'm not coming here anymore.
I hate my father's women.

772
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:06,229
No

773
01:07:08,526 --> 01:07:15,182
Hisayo is not his woman.
If she's his woman, she'd have made him recognize the kids and gotten all the child support and property he's got.

774
01:07:16,096 --> 01:07:17,862
It's same

775
01:07:19,526 --> 01:07:23,815
Hisayo lived with Kazuo all by herself.

776
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:26,893
You can understand the pain and suffering?

777
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:30,213
I don't know what it's like.
You're an animal either

778
01:07:30,651 --> 01:07:34,284
She was happy to be in my father's arms.
She would have laughed

779
01:07:34,346 --> 01:07:35,003
Sasabayashi

780
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:37,854
What's the matter with you?
Why don't you shut up?

781
01:07:38,104 --> 01:07:38,846
Stupid!

782
01:07:40,870 --> 01:07:43,362
Don't be so naive.

783
01:07:44,409 --> 01:07:48,245
Just because your father's a jerk doesn't mean you're a jerk.
When you're angry, you should study harder.

784
01:07:49,784 --> 01:07:52,253
You're gonna be a great person.

785
01:07:54,065 --> 01:07:55,721
He's gonna apologize to you

786
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:57,643
Shut up!

787
01:08:09,571 --> 01:08:10,290
What the hell?

788
01:08:11,282 --> 01:08:16,751
You' re evil.
Not only Namie, but also HISAYO, you are an asshole!

789
01:08:17,735 --> 01:08:21,571
Ichiro, you're an adult now and you should know about it

790
01:08:22,407 --> 01:08:27,828
All Women are a toy.
People who fall in love with them are fools. Remember it

791
01:08:28,454 --> 01:08:31,540
You are still an animal.
I'm gonna kill you.

792
01:08:33,249 --> 01:08:37,600
Can you kill me?
It's just a girl thing.

793
01:08:46,048 --> 01:08:47,337
I knew it

794
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:51,548
In exchange, I'll do something worse.

795
01:08:52,665 --> 01:08:56,728
I'll do something so bad, it'll be in the papers, and I'll humiliate you.

796
01:09:13,545 --> 01:09:17,045
He's got such a pretty face, it's hard to believe he's that guy's kid.

797
01:10:28,939 --> 01:10:30,142
Who's there?

798
01:10:36,203 --> 01:10:37,312
Kazuo!

799
01:10:41,164 --> 01:10:43,054
Kazuo!

800
01:10:47,463 --> 01:10:49,611
Sugiura, the teacher, is an idiot.

801
01:10:50,182 --> 01:10:54,447
I can't believe he left the stove on and went outside.
I'd advise against it.

802
01:10:54,908 --> 01:10:57,244
I donate a lot of money to a school that was burned down.

803
01:10:57,979 --> 01:11:01,119
I can't believe he let a kid stay at the duty station.

804
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:08,861
I think He is dating with Hisayo.
Teachers these days do shady things behind the scenes.

805
01:11:11,135 --> 01:11:15,564
Dad,
You don't recognize a child named KAZUO,OK?

806
01:11:16,033 --> 01:11:19,791
Of course not.
I don't want to be blamed for the property or the child support.

807
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:24,986
First of all, I never know what she might have done after that.It might not even be my kid.

808
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,518
You sure?

809
01:11:27,275 --> 01:11:31,947
Don't worry about it.
It's my policy to have women and not have children.

810
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,979
That's why you won't let me have one either.

811
01:11:36,439 --> 01:11:43,298
Except you.
You'll lose your sex appeal and your taste buds if you have kids.

812
01:11:44,088 --> 01:11:51,017
I won't leave you no matter what kind of grandmother I become, okay?

813
01:11:51,705 --> 01:11:53,736
Okay, okay.

814
01:12:07,750 --> 01:12:08,359
Ichiro

815
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:10,015
What?

816
01:12:10,609 --> 01:12:17,281
Arson is a serious crime, punishable by death.
That fire at the school last night... was that your doing?

817
01:12:19,181 --> 01:12:19,962
Not me

818
01:12:20,853 --> 01:12:21,775
Okay, then.

819
01:12:22,556 --> 01:12:26,134
So even if... you did it, don't say a word.

820
01:12:26,782 --> 01:12:29,712
We don't have a shred of evidence.
If this goes to court, we won't lose.

821
01:12:30,603 --> 01:12:33,353
I'll spend every dime and lawyer I have to get you acquitted.

822
01:12:33,853 --> 01:12:35,001
Not me

823
01:12:38,471 --> 01:12:42,526
I've been caught in the net of the law many times. But I never confessed.

824
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:46,151
That's why I'm now a proud owner of Hokkaido's tourism business.

825
01:12:46,925 --> 01:12:51,354
You're my son.
Don't make a mistake that will get you caught by the police.

826
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:55,724
If you become an ex-convict. Your life is over.

827
01:12:58,896 --> 01:12:59,567
All right

828
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:07,036
And NAMIE is a valued customer of mine.
If you try anything funny, I won't let you get away with it.

829
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:17,671
Dad, Look at me

830
01:13:20,468 --> 01:13:21,648
Something's changed, hasn't it?

831
01:13:22,429 --> 01:13:22,984
What?

832
01:13:24,742 --> 01:13:27,531
I might have a baby

833
01:13:31,819 --> 01:13:32,921
You sure?

834
01:13:34,108 --> 01:13:38,663
I showed it to the doctor and he said I'm seven months pregnant.

835
01:13:40,507 --> 01:13:41,601
Who's guy?

836
01:13:43,023 --> 01:13:44,124
I don't know

837
01:13:44,921 --> 01:13:47,538
I met this guy when I went skiing this winter.

838
01:13:49,272 --> 01:13:53,929
He came into my room at night, out of the blue, and he forced his way into my panties.

839
01:13:54,093 --> 01:13:56,671
I get it.
Get an abortion.

840
01:13:57,476 --> 01:13:58,031
No

841
01:13:59,093 --> 01:14:02,742
You're stupid.
You have not got married yet

842
01:14:03,328 --> 01:14:06,031
How about Hisayo?

843
01:14:07,226 --> 01:14:10,031
She had her daddy's baby before she got married.

844
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:13,109
I'm gonna do the same thing.

845
01:14:13,601 --> 01:14:14,960
That's different case

846
01:14:16,851 --> 01:14:21,187
So you don't care what happens to other people, but you do care about your own daughter?

847
01:14:21,515 --> 01:14:23,804
Don't say bullshit.
See a doctor with your mom

848
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:27,960
No.
It's too late

849
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:33,250
She's twitching in my belly!
She's so cute!

850
01:14:34,101 --> 01:14:39,414
You idiot!
Two months and seven months are the same. We can have a C-section.

851
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:43,765
Seven months is a full human being.

852
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:47,312
What kind of parent tells someone to kill them?

853
01:14:48,835 --> 01:14:51,828
No wonder your kids are so stupid.

854
01:14:53,210 --> 01:14:54,929
Seriously you can't raise a child.

855
01:14:56,804 --> 01:14:59,914
You're stupid.
Get an abortion.

856
01:15:04,531 --> 01:15:08,742
I heard you outside the door.

857
01:15:09,930 --> 01:15:13,883
You're the one who set Mr. Sugiura's shift on fire?

858
01:15:15,141 --> 01:15:16,469
To frame him?

859
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:17,672
No

860
01:15:19,367 --> 01:15:25,235
He's resigning to answer for your crimes.
It's not fair of you to stand there and watch.

861
01:15:26,821 --> 01:15:29,211
You were going to destroy our father's face in the first place.

862
01:15:30,508 --> 01:15:33,758
Why don't you go to the police and come clean?

863
01:15:35,031 --> 01:15:37,453
He'll get upset, and he'll straighten up a little.

864
01:15:40,266 --> 01:15:42,367
Leave me alone

865
01:15:44,821 --> 01:15:48,844
I'm leaving this house.
I'm not going back while NAMIE's here.

866
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:53,977
Of course I lied about being pregnant.
I was just trying to scare my father.

867
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:58,235
Follow me and be brave

868
01:16:04,083 --> 01:16:09,294
Your enemy is your father.
You'll be a big boy when you beat him.

869
01:16:10,403 --> 01:16:11,317
Don't let him beat you.

870
01:16:12,145 --> 01:16:13,012
See you

871
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:38,107
Ms. Ishihara.

I am so sorry.

872
01:16:38,810 --> 01:16:42,107
I burned Kazuo because of my carelessness.

873
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:46,536
I can't believe you started that fire.

874
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:49,177
I'm sure you're protecting someone.

875
01:16:49,202 --> 01:16:52,669
I'm careless sometime

876
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:55,724
I forgot to turn off the stove.

877
01:16:56,677 --> 01:16:58,935
You really want to quit, don't you?

878
01:17:00,622 --> 01:17:02,435
I've already submitted my resignation.

879
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:05,818
Actually, I lost my confident

880
01:17:07,036 --> 01:17:10,841
I've supported ICHIRO up until now, like beating him up, but to no effect

881
01:17:12,224 --> 01:17:16,833
I'm not a good teacher.
I'm going to Tokyo for a while to think about it.

882
01:17:18,974 --> 01:17:25,193
If I regain my confidence, I'll teach again.
I'll ask you to marry me again.

883
01:17:26,154 --> 01:17:29,138
I like you even more now that you've told me about your past, a

884
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:30,935
 I'll be waiting for you.

885
01:17:32,044 --> 01:17:37,357
I never married until now... because I was afraid of men.

886
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:41,474
I thought they'd all be like Sasabayashi Goichi.

887
01:17:41,499 --> 01:17:46,185
That's terrible.
Men come in all shapes and sizes.

888
01:17:47,349 --> 01:17:53,044
There are men like you.
I've only recently come to realize that.

889
01:17:54,068 --> 01:17:57,044
I want to quit this impossible life of being a woman alone.

890
01:17:58,654 --> 01:18:01,865
It causes a lot of trouble for those around me.

891
01:18:10,631 --> 01:18:11,569
Sasabayashi

892
01:18:15,923 --> 01:18:18,821
Do you want something to say?

893
01:18:21,173 --> 01:18:21,837
No

894
01:18:21,985 --> 01:18:22,751
I want

895
01:18:26,487 --> 01:18:28,425
I think this hat belongs to you.

896
01:18:29,941 --> 01:18:31,901
I picked it up near the inn room at the fire.

897
01:18:32,769 --> 01:18:33,433
Take it.

898
01:18:34,526 --> 01:18:35,269
It's not mine.

899
01:18:37,675 --> 01:18:38,949
I'll give it back anyway.

900
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:41,027
Take it back.

901
01:18:42,769 --> 01:18:45,347
You think I started the fire, don't you?

902
01:18:46,496 --> 01:18:48,214
So why don't you just say so?

903
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:54,464
You can talk to the police.
If you're mad at me for getting fired, hit me.

904
01:18:55,324 --> 01:18:59,144
I don't want to.
You're not a kid. You're a grown man.

905
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:02,113
You can take care of yourself.

906
01:19:03,441 --> 01:19:07,738
You're so good at covering for other people's sins.

907
01:19:10,725 --> 01:19:13,068
You've come all this way.
Go see Kazuo

908
01:19:15,701 --> 01:19:19,881
He's waiting for you... make him happy.

909
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,040
Come on, boy.

910
01:19:33,385 --> 01:19:35,229
He's here

911
01:19:36,643 --> 01:19:37,424
Hi

912
01:19:38,151 --> 01:19:43,745
Don't worry.
Fortunately, KAZUO's burns are minor.

913
01:19:44,206 --> 01:19:46,573
After the treatment, it will be completely healed.

914
01:19:47,135 --> 01:19:49,409
Well, I'll be on my way.
I have a train to catch.

915
01:19:49,924 --> 01:19:51,424
I'll take you to the front.

916
01:19:52,628 --> 01:19:57,073
Ichiro, will you stay by Kazuo's side during this time?

917
01:19:59,885 --> 01:20:00,385
Yeah

918
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:01,995
Thanks

919
01:20:15,059 --> 01:20:19,458
My fingers got stuck together from the burns.
That's weird.

920
01:20:30,103 --> 01:20:31,946
why didn't you see it?

921
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:37,087
I'm sorry, it's my fault.

922
01:20:38,462 --> 01:20:43,071
I'm your real brother but...

923
01:20:46,614 --> 01:20:47,286
I'm sorry

924
01:20:51,223 --> 01:20:54,590
I can't believe Midori ran away from home.

925
01:20:55,153 --> 01:20:56,950
What a bunch of pathetic children.

926
01:20:57,692 --> 01:21:01,653
I can't believe you're home-schooling these pathetic kids.
All you do is play.

927
01:21:02,512 --> 01:21:04,684
Have you ever taken them seriously?

928
01:21:05,496 --> 01:21:10,887
Can they live in a house like this all the time?
I've done my best, in my own painful way.

929
01:21:11,145 --> 01:21:15,996
A mother who can't even bring up her own children is a failure.
You're disgusting.

930
01:21:32,058 --> 01:21:34,261
Hello? Is this the police?

931
01:21:34,785 --> 01:21:36,519
I set fire to Hokuei Junior High School.

932
01:21:37,136 --> 01:21:39,081
His name is Ichiro Sasabayashi

933
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:45,415
Yes, I'm the son of GOICHI
Arrest me immediately!

934
01:21:47,657 --> 01:21:48,407
Ichiro

935
01:21:48,899 --> 01:21:49,962
You

936
01:21:50,610 --> 01:21:57,141
I'll tell them why you set the fire.
I'll tell them everything that happened in this house.

937
01:22:02,863 --> 01:22:03,606
You're stupid

938
01:22:06,621 --> 01:22:08,184
I knew it was my fault.

939
01:22:09,590 --> 01:22:13,223
I should have left from you

940
01:22:14,942 --> 01:22:18,817
This house is already falling apart.
It's falling apart like a house of blocks.

941
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:23,134
What have I been doing?

942
01:22:23,236 --> 01:22:25,463
You're stupid!
Stop complaining.

943
01:22:44,197 --> 01:22:45,268
Goodbye.

944
01:23:20,106 --> 01:23:28,606
THE END

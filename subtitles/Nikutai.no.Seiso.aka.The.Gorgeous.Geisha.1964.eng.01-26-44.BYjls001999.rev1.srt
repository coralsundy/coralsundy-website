00:00:18,402 --> 00:00:30,063
 <i>The Gorgeous Geisha / Nikutai no Seiso (1964)</i>

3
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,521
Yeah,It's nice wind.

4
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,822
It's too late now,

5
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,659
You're terrible.

6
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,760
I didn't want to be your wife.

7
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,497
When I want to break up, I will break up

8
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,183
You're too cold.

9
00:02:32,649 --> 00:02:34,175
so when the money runs out, then you leave me?

10
00:02:34,843 --> 00:02:36,350
It could be.

11
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:42,206
Our relationship is tied to money.

12
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:45,630
It's hard for me to break up with you

13
00:02:46,243 --> 00:02:50,164
I will rebuild my business. I am a well-known face in the brokers.

14
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,596
so I'm sure I'll make it. Please

15
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,966
Let's continue our relationship.

16
00:02:57,944 --> 00:03:01,632
I have to go.
Thank you very much.

17
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:05,464
Is that a farewell greeting?
You took a lot of money from me.

18
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,561
Don't say that.

19
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,655
I'm offering my precious body to you

20
00:03:11,806 --> 00:03:12,720
Wait.

21
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,632
What the hell?

22
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,275
Get your hands off of me!

23
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:23,441
It's funny.

24
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,443
Good evening.

25
00:03:56,913 --> 00:03:58,160
Welcome.

26
00:04:06,297 --> 00:04:07,857
Good evening,sis.

27
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:12,233
Yamashita is upset again.

28
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:15,035
Oh Yamashita...

29
00:04:15,483 --> 00:04:18,070
Did you meet a good man?

30
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:23,055
No way.
My face is telling that.

31
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,450
Oh my god.

32
00:04:28,156 --> 00:04:30,556
It's written on your face in big letters.

33
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:34,116
It's written like Yamashita.

34
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,366
Oh, I really appreciate it

35
00:04:36,628 --> 00:04:38,321
I don't wanna bother you.

36
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,061
Sorry for making you wait.

37
00:04:44,454 --> 00:04:47,105
but it's fine. I only waited an hour.

38
00:04:47,764 --> 00:04:49,789
More importantly, I brought the promised thing

39
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,716
Did you really bring it?

40
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,589
I promised you, didn't I?

41
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,006
I'm not the kind of guy who would lie

42
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,099
Take it.

43
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:00,825
Thanks.

44
00:05:01,149 --> 00:05:02,535
I'm so sorry

45
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,166
I was surprised yesterday,

46
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,832
You shouldn't have called the store.

47
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:12,504
I wanted to see you in sudden.

48
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,313
I am Yamashita, a promotion officer who has
worked diligently for 20 years

49
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:21,453
If anyone finds out about this, my credibility will be ruined.

50
00:05:21,588 --> 00:05:23,702
Which is more important, me or SOKUSHINGAN?

51
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,814
Either way, both are important

52
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,895
I know it's no good, but just tell me straight out

53
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:31,806
You're annoying.

54
00:05:32,849 --> 00:05:34,474
I guess you know how I feel.

55
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,055
So, you chose me?

56
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,890
Let me tell you straight away

57
00:05:43,544 --> 00:05:45,435
You're so cute.

58
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:50,140
Harue?

59
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:54,630
What is she doing?
Can you call her again?

60
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,387
Tell her to come here soon.

61
00:06:09,429 --> 00:06:10,613
No.

62
00:06:16,198 --> 00:06:17,127
Kimicho?

63
00:06:17,478 --> 00:06:19,012
I got a call from your home.

64
00:06:19,225 --> 00:06:20,525
I get it.

65
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,965
Sis?
It's Taeko.

66
00:06:28,849 --> 00:06:31,399
Our mom said you have to come back right away.

67
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,227
What's wrong?

68
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,255
Watanabe-san?

69
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:37,837
Is he there again?

70
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:40,890
I told you not to pay him any attention,

71
00:06:42,397 --> 00:06:44,235
Don't complain to me.

72
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,443
Come back quickly.

73
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,463
I'm going.

74
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:12,528
Which room?

75
00:07:13,613 --> 00:07:14,657
It's Suzumoto

76
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:18,520
Well, Please stop by Fukujiro for a bit and tell
my sister to come home early.

77
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:21,440
OK.
I'm going.

78
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,906
Fukuya, you haven't eaten yet?

79
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,742
I'll have it later.

80
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,023
So, if you're not feeling well, you can take a rest

81
00:07:42,704 --> 00:07:44,231
Thank you very much.

82
00:07:48,785 --> 00:07:50,752
Well, I'm off now.

83
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:10,514
Please polish Watanabe-san's shoes.

84
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,317
I know it's not a good idea to ask you, but I have nowhere to go

85
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:32,778
I see. I will do my best

86
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,674
Please rest assured

87
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,286
If you could say that to me, it would be a great help

88
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,494
Please.

89
00:08:42,827 --> 00:08:44,781
Don't do stupid things.

90
00:08:46,028 --> 00:08:49,028
I'll try to get back to you within 3,4 days

91
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,093
Thank you for your kind words

92
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,332
I was going to ask Kimicho.

93
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,445
but I'll come back again

94
00:09:16,946 --> 00:09:18,030
Well then.

95
00:09:18,757 --> 00:09:20,724
please say hello to Goikkyo.

96
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:31,677
I guess you refused.

97
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:34,381
Did you go home?

98
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:38,176
He wanted to meet you.
Why didn't you come?

99
00:09:38,903 --> 00:09:41,903
When I look at that person's face, I feel sick to my stomach

100
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,793
Is he asking for money again?

101
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,266
How did you reply?

102
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:51,321
Did you pretend to be good?

103
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,390
He relies on me.

104
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,166
I can't be cold to him.

105
00:09:59,196 --> 00:10:00,052
It's not cold.

106
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,223
We cannot provide 2 million yen.

107
00:10:05,736 --> 00:10:07,353
It's something you can understand if you think about it

108
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,260
His company will go bankrupt and employees will run away with the money

109
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:15,302
He's really miserable.

110
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:19,605
If he's having financial difficulties

111
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,281
He is going to jail

112
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,424
I wish He'd go to prison.

113
00:10:25,147 --> 00:10:27,180
He's drunk and eaten here

114
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:28,719
He defaulted on his debts,

115
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:32,710
and now he wants to lend us 2 million yen?
What's the hell he's doing?

116
00:10:34,303 --> 00:10:36,836
You're true but please think about it.

117
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:42,928
What about you and Hideyoshi? Aren't you half-brothers?

118
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,497
I am the child of his mistress.

119
00:10:45,616 --> 00:10:47,185
that's enough now.

120
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:48,483
You shut up

121
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:55,544
When Watanabe died,
we cut all ties

122
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,822
They cut ties with us.

123
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,254
The Watanabe family is a complete stranger now.

124
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,960
But...

125
00:11:10,944 --> 00:11:12,751
so he's an annoying person

126
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:18,952
Ours doesn't have that kind of money.

127
00:11:20,895 --> 00:11:23,895
If we mortgage this house we can borrow money

128
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,958
Don't say stupid things

129
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,616
If this house is gone,

130
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,046
where will we sleep?

131
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:31,259
Are the three of them going to be homeless?

132
00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:34,709
Mom.
Something has happened.

133
00:11:35,506 --> 00:11:36,379
Fukuya...

134
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:37,117
What?

135
00:11:37,518 --> 00:11:41,637
She collapsed, vomiting blood.

136
00:11:42,097 --> 00:11:43,706
so please go quickly

137
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,567
She was just taken to the hospital

138
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,270
Only bad things happen.

139
00:12:22,257 --> 00:12:22,977
Sis.

140
00:12:30,128 --> 00:12:30,888
Sis.

141
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:35,093
What's wrong?

142
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Today I'm going to talk about marriage

143
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,744
It's fine.
Go ahead.

144
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,365
Please go soon

145
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,353
I'm going by bike today.

146
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,049
Good morning. Good morning

147
00:13:40,516 --> 00:13:42,023
Is she Taeko of Shizunoya?

148
00:13:42,128 --> 00:13:43,825
She's grown well.

149
00:13:44,201 --> 00:13:45,936
She works for the city's tourism association

150
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,914
It's such a waste,

151
00:13:48,303 --> 00:13:49,842
Why you don't work as Geisha?

152
00:13:49,909 --> 00:13:50,663
that's true.

153
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:20,057
Good morning

154
00:14:20,963 --> 00:14:21,895
I was late.

155
00:14:21,968 --> 00:14:22,821
It's ok.

156
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,448
Good morning. Good morning

157
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,322
Good morning. Good morning

158
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,138
I'm going.

159
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,130
I'm going to ask you to do this

160
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:42,878
Hello?

161
00:14:45,108 --> 00:14:46,841
Hello?

162
00:15:00,016 --> 00:15:00,796
May I come in?

163
00:15:01,096 --> 00:15:01,636
Yes.

164
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:16,950
It's me. What are you going to do?

165
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,054
I'll show my mom this.

166
00:15:20,473 --> 00:15:24,525
I talked to my mom last night.
She said ok.

167
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,540
Really?I will talk today too.

168
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,080
I'll make a great wife.

169
00:15:41,094 --> 00:15:42,087
Turn on the lights.

170
00:15:46,971 --> 00:15:47,671
Tae.

171
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:50,844
You can't do this here.

172
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,979
Landlady?

173
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:13,489
Oh I see.

174
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,783
The doctors said to stay at my home.

175
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,256
I see.

176
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,358
Take good care of you.

177
00:16:23,535 --> 00:16:24,675
Thank you.

178
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,199
Get well soon,Fukuya-san

179
00:16:27,505 --> 00:16:29,032
Thank you.

180
00:16:37,182 --> 00:16:38,624
Welcome back.

181
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,044
Have you made her bed?

182
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:40,618
Yes.

183
00:16:44,173 --> 00:16:45,942
What a bad luck.

184
00:16:57,005 --> 00:16:59,345
I'll give you a hand

185
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,532
What are you talking about? You're a sick person

186
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,890
Now, you need to get changed quickly and go to bed quietly

187
00:17:43,756 --> 00:17:46,293
The doctor at the hospital told you

188
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:50,334
Rest is the best thing you can do. You have to stay still

189
00:17:53,334 --> 00:17:54,928
Mom, I'm sorry.

190
00:17:55,002 --> 00:17:56,402
but this is what happened anyway

191
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,167
You don't have to say anything.

192
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,126
I'm sorry.

193
00:18:06,134 --> 00:18:06,647
Mom?

194
00:18:08,036 --> 00:18:08,616
Come here.

195
00:18:14,075 --> 00:18:15,484
Fukuya....

196
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:18,425
Did you mortgage this house?

197
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,957
Why did you do that without telling me?

198
00:18:27,790 --> 00:18:30,790
If I told you, you wouldn't forgive me

199
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:33,915
What kind of person is you?

200
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,240
Everyone around here is laughing at us.

201
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:41,770
For you, helping others is giving back, right?

202
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:47,459
But our lives must come first.

203
00:18:51,187 --> 00:18:53,410
How would you prepare the 2 million yen?

204
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,889
Someone buy this house for us

205
00:18:57,288 --> 00:18:59,479
What if I could just borrow from that person?

206
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:02,687
Where in the world do idiots like that live these days?

207
00:19:02,992 --> 00:19:05,045
They'd be kicked us out before we could even borrow from them

208
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,873
I want to repay.

209
00:19:08,173 --> 00:19:09,928
I'm going to work again soon

210
00:19:10,336 --> 00:19:12,132
I can work as Geisha again.

211
00:19:12,326 --> 00:19:16,311
What are you talking about?
You're too old for Geisha.

212
00:19:16,936 --> 00:19:19,006
Maybe you can just work as housekeeper.

213
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,398
But Hideo-san was shedding tears

214
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,621
He will never forget our kindness,

215
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:29,177
He pushed his hands together

216
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:31,657
Stop saying it.

217
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:45,656
Fukuya seems to be in a bad state, so I wonder how she will be until summer

218
00:19:46,616 --> 00:19:48,525
Bloodline is nothing to be scared of these days

219
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,116
That's not the case

220
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,984
She has severe tuberculosis.

221
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,749
Because she doesn't have enough enthusiasm,she got disease.

222
00:19:58,595 --> 00:19:59,682
She can hear.

223
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,062
You don't have to shout out loud.

224
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:07,576
We have a sick person and debts.
Do whatever you want.

225
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,097
Let's go.

226
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:29,551
See you.

227
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:30,449
See you later.

228
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:00,382
Welcome back.

229
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:14,404
Welcome back.

230
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,487
Welcome back.

231
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:30,839
Where's Mom?

232
00:23:32,063 --> 00:23:32,810
She's here.

233
00:23:32,997 --> 00:23:33,417
I see.

234
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:36,187
Oh, Isehama has come here.

235
00:23:41,329 --> 00:23:43,740
That story has a reputation.

236
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,000
We mortgaged this house and paid for it.

237
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,878
He did something reckless.

238
00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:52,670
That's good story.

239
00:23:53,221 --> 00:23:56,101
He's a fall guy.

240
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:58,942
That's enough.

241
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:00,002
Thanks.

242
00:24:00,027 --> 00:24:03,196
Apparently Shizunoya and you are a childhood friend

243
00:24:03,397 --> 00:24:05,847
You've been sisters since the time of Maiko.

244
00:24:06,322 --> 00:24:07,915
Well, that's how we are.

245
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,132
Good night.

246
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:18,240
Okiku has always loved to do stupid things

247
00:24:19,061 --> 00:24:23,017
She's a nice girl who can have a decent husband.

248
00:24:23,507 --> 00:24:26,840
She was even loyal to the Watanabe

249
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:32,228
She's happy to mortgage the house.

250
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:35,529
It's amazing, but not everyone can do it

251
00:24:36,306 --> 00:24:39,030
I'll try it if it comes down to it.

252
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:40,267
You are really excited

253
00:24:40,669 --> 00:24:42,435
I buy a horse, ok?

254
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,004
Don't say stupid things

255
00:24:46,641 --> 00:24:49,336
Mom, the young master...

256
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:50,373
He has gone home?

257
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,417
He seems to be on a different business.

258
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:01,042
What's wrong?

259
00:25:03,610 --> 00:25:04,336
Well.

260
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:05,962
What do you want?

261
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:12,171
So Okiku of the Shizunoya and watanabe got fight.

262
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,439
For Dead OKIKU's husband?

263
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:17,250
Well, in the end, Okiku did win.

264
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,296
So Chiyo was broken heart.

265
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,527
I didn't know.

266
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,404
but humans don't know what happiness is

267
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:25,655
Well, Chiyo was dumped and picked up
by the Kono clan of the Minyuto Party,

268
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,866
and he paid for here.

269
00:25:27,306 --> 00:25:29,006
The Kono was dead, right?

270
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:31,586
Of course. so I am boss now.

271
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,959
Are you saying you're going to marry with Taeko of Shizunoya?

272
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:41,824
We've promised for a year now.

273
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,081
You can't.

274
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,657
Please break her up.

275
00:25:45,988 --> 00:25:46,474
But.

276
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:49,822
She's a daughter of tea houses

277
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:52,029
Even if you say that, our family is same, isn't it?

278
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:55,243
Even among tea houses, the status is different

279
00:25:55,489 --> 00:25:57,465
So, mom, is it really not okay?

280
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:58,416
Absolutely not

281
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,319
But we have been in contact with the Shizunoya up until now.

282
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,516
It's just a superficial obligation

283
00:26:07,306 --> 00:26:10,306
No matter how many times you say this,

284
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,202
You have to flatly refuse

285
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,706
If it's too big for you,
I will refuse.

286
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:22,908
Ko-chan.

287
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:25,528
Ko-chan.

288
00:26:40,196 --> 00:26:41,087
Good evening

289
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,024
Welcome

290
00:26:46,754 --> 00:26:48,454
It's me.

291
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,087
It's been a while.

292
00:26:50,695 --> 00:26:53,695
Ochiyo.
Thank you for coming. Please feel free to come in.

293
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,192
Thanks. just a little bit.

294
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:00,208
Please come in.

295
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,186
Thanks.

296
00:27:05,045 --> 00:27:06,245
It's been a while.

297
00:27:06,722 --> 00:27:07,916
Same here.

298
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:13,361
so please don't worry about it. I'll leaving soon.

299
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:14,956
You don't have to say that,

300
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,564
just take your time

301
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:22,042
You are always the same.

302
00:27:22,459 --> 00:27:23,846
You're not getting any older

303
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:25,826
You think so?

304
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:29,310
You are always the same too.

305
00:27:31,082 --> 00:27:32,175
Mom.

306
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:34,514
Welcome.

307
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:35,607
Good evening.

308
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:50,188
She's grown well.

309
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:52,783
Yes she is.

310
00:27:59,651 --> 00:28:03,398
You should drink this.
it's turtle blood.

311
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:06,098
I heard it's good for chest problems.

312
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:09,924
Thank you very much.

313
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:16,331
And I thought you'd get bored so I bought some for you even though it's out of season

314
00:28:32,595 --> 00:28:36,095
I'm here to talk about Taeko-san

315
00:28:37,146 --> 00:28:38,111
Thank you very much

316
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,596
I was hoping to visit you once

317
00:28:42,374 --> 00:28:44,079
but I didn't know anything about it

318
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:49,048
I was shocked when I heard from Koji today

319
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:53,846
I see. Koji-san came to see her later that month

320
00:28:54,329 --> 00:28:57,947
I wanted to decline their marriage.

321
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,760
Koji works for a tourism company as a hobby,

322
00:29:09,593 --> 00:29:12,485
but he will have to take over the family business someday

323
00:29:12,871 --> 00:29:15,931
I think a bride needs to come from a decent family

324
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,637
You mean Taeko is too bad?

325
00:29:20,855 --> 00:29:22,402
I don't want you to misunderstand that

326
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,363
I don't mean she's bad

327
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:29,489
A tea house in Gion,Kikutei that is somewhat well known

328
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,946
We have prestige.

329
00:29:33,099 --> 00:29:34,798
Please tell Taeko about it

330
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:37,902
From now on, please keep him as a friend.

331
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:44,365
Mom, you've been made fun of so much, you can't say anything?

332
00:29:44,778 --> 00:29:45,825
Stay away

333
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,009
I don't know how great you are

334
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:50,652
We are same human being.

335
00:29:53,429 --> 00:29:56,329
How great does that thing make?

336
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,329
Anyway, if it's just a tea shop.

337
00:29:58,644 --> 00:29:59,911
It's just water business.

338
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:03,714
Is there something special about you guys?

339
00:30:04,638 --> 00:30:08,435
You have become a fine speaker.

340
00:30:08,922 --> 00:30:09,976
I'll remember that.

341
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,654
Please remember that.

342
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,531
We are same.

343
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:16,451
I've heard rumors about you, but you're brilliant.

344
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:19,754
I hear you do a bullish business.

345
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:22,364
Are you dealing a Sokushingan watchman?

346
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,119
Well, you know very much.

347
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:28,349
I'm a physical type, so if he's a good man,
I'll make a move on you as many times as I can

348
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,403
Please stop it.
Forgive me....

349
00:30:32,428 --> 00:30:35,645
Well, I flatly refused about Taeko

350
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,293
Stop talking and get out.

351
00:30:37,507 --> 00:30:39,039
Thank you.

352
00:30:40,746 --> 00:30:41,540
Ochiyo.

353
00:30:44,110 --> 00:30:45,697
Mom, hurry up and pour salt.

354
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,007
Are you drunk?

355
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:06,625
I hate this world

356
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,536
I'm leaving the house

357
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,586
so you should leave too

358
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,497
Let's do that

359
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,515
It's not that easy

360
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,343
If we work together, it will work out

361
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,484
I'm not as free here as you are

362
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,843
I am an adopted child.

363
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:44,954
I understand your pain, but if things continue like this, what will happen to us?

364
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:48,437
Tae...

365
00:31:54,507 --> 00:31:57,507
Tae..., don't leave me

366
00:31:58,063 --> 00:31:59,000
You too.

367
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,328
We can't do this.

368
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,742
Get your hands off of me.

369
00:32:31,547 --> 00:32:33,389
We can't do this.

370
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:34,757
Let me go.

371
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:39,553
Tae-chan. It's okay. Please forgive me.

372
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:42,235
Will you marry me?

373
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Marry me

374
00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:50,150
Marry me, promise me

375
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:56,021
Say it, say it.

376
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,422
Why don't say it?

377
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,906
You won't give me any promises?

378
00:33:13,336 --> 00:33:16,336
You are coward.

379
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:45,844
Can't you do something about it?

380
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:51,031
If I get 2 million, that's a lot of money

381
00:33:52,622 --> 00:33:55,622
Well, I have some ideas too.

382
00:33:56,318 --> 00:33:57,922
Good evening.

383
00:33:58,156 --> 00:33:59,156
Good evening.

384
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:14,476
I guess if I spend about 200,000 yen,I can probably do something about it.

385
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,040
It's okay now.

386
00:34:18,305 --> 00:34:19,219
 Are you angry?

387
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,729
What if I get angry?

388
00:34:37,422 --> 00:34:38,257
Let's go home.

389
00:34:38,282 --> 00:34:39,063
Yes.

390
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:41,313
I don't want anyone to see.

391
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:03,015
Good evening.

392
00:35:03,242 --> 00:35:04,703
Oh Kimi.

393
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,477
Dance with me.

394
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:09,967
I'm not good at dancing.
I might step on your foot

395
00:35:11,078 --> 00:35:13,297
I want you to step on my feet.

396
00:35:13,322 --> 00:35:14,219
I am very honored.

397
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,211
You are good at dancing.

398
00:35:50,257 --> 00:35:51,471
I'm doing my best.

399
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:54,101
Please hold me tight

400
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:56,166
Someone gets angry at you?

401
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,773
you're a stupid person

402
00:35:58,128 --> 00:36:01,128
I'm lonely.

403
00:36:01,352 --> 00:36:03,164
Is there anyone nice?

404
00:36:03,438 --> 00:36:04,055
It hurts.

405
00:36:04,117 --> 00:36:05,910
I'm sorry

406
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:21,281
Where is she gone?

407
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,922
Welcome.

408
00:36:41,534 --> 00:36:43,522
Good evening

409
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,289
Oh Kimi.

410
00:36:46,492 --> 00:36:47,414
Are you busy?

411
00:36:47,702 --> 00:36:48,915
I'm doing okay.

412
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,953
New food orders have been placed.

413
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:52,617
I get it.

414
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:54,843
Hey, mom, good evening.

415
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:56,735
What are you up to?

416
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:59,468
What happened? Please come and see me sometimes

417
00:36:59,648 --> 00:37:01,601
So, are you alone today?

418
00:37:01,676 --> 00:37:04,452
Yes, I came to invite  Isehama-san.

419
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,601
Thank you very much.

420
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:08,996
please enjoy the big party

421
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,020
After all, He loves dancing very much.

422
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:16,790
so she's a good mother

423
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:19,785
Among here, no one cares about me.

424
00:37:20,146 --> 00:37:23,117
I can't believe it, let's go dancing.

425
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:26,220
Oh, wait a minute, our cook is coming back now

426
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,366
What do you want to eat?

427
00:37:27,391 --> 00:37:28,258
Thank you very much.

428
00:37:28,398 --> 00:37:29,346
What do you like?

429
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,816
I'll have a beer.

430
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,703
Bring beer.

431
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,386
Who is that?

432
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:38,969
No, it's nothing.

433
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:40,914
Please.

434
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:49,242
Tae came to dance.

435
00:37:50,615 --> 00:37:54,273
You should be a little wary of her.

436
00:37:55,841 --> 00:37:59,882
She is very well known.

437
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:04,086
Most men like her.

438
00:39:06,964 --> 00:39:09,507
Ah, it feels so good.

439
00:39:10,164 --> 00:39:11,492
I feel hot.

440
00:39:13,945 --> 00:39:15,234
Sorry.

441
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,195
Don't sleep, you'll catch a cold.

442
00:39:42,275 --> 00:39:45,275
I like you Isehama.

443
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,867
maybe I'll fall in love with you,

444
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:50,391
Let's have fun.

445
00:40:36,109 --> 00:40:37,615
Excuse me.

446
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,640
Welcome.

447
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,897
Okiku! Thank you for coming

448
00:40:45,197 --> 00:40:51,086
It's a great restaurant.
You seem like a real businessman.

449
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:55,468
I'm still an apprentice, but I'm trying my best

450
00:40:56,522 --> 00:40:57,857
Thanks to you.

451
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,281
Please don't say such flattery.

452
00:41:03,082 --> 00:41:05,421
Thank you very much.

453
00:41:07,163 --> 00:41:08,937
Thanks.

454
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,945
Okiku is here, come on.

455
00:41:18,961 --> 00:41:20,180
Welcome.

456
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:22,961
You look good.

457
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:24,687
It's been ages.

458
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,149
Your child has grown so much

459
00:41:28,665 --> 00:41:30,164
Thanks to you,

460
00:41:31,050 --> 00:41:33,835
Here's sloppy place, but please come in.

461
00:41:34,469 --> 00:41:35,852
Thanks.

462
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,381
Come in.

463
00:41:41,406 --> 00:41:43,820
Excuse me.

464
00:41:49,027 --> 00:41:52,027
Okiku is here

465
00:41:53,771 --> 00:41:56,771
It's been a while

466
00:41:58,814 --> 00:42:01,234
Thank you for coming

467
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,969
Thanks.

468
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:12,732
You saved our family.

469
00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:16,270
I can't do anything about it,

470
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:30,117
I apologize for treating you like a mistress.

471
00:42:31,288 --> 00:42:32,992
Forgive me....

472
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,664
Please don't say anything anymore.

473
00:42:44,532 --> 00:42:46,928
It's raining again

474
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,680
Yes.

475
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:15,734
It's time for dinner.

476
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:19,141
Thanks.

477
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:30,147
It's your favorite dish.
Eat your favorite miso stew

478
00:43:31,107 --> 00:43:32,233
Thanks.

479
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,109
You need to eat properly.

480
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:56,242
Will I get better?

481
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:58,877
You will get better

482
00:43:59,244 --> 00:44:00,547
Don't worry.

483
00:44:03,508 --> 00:44:05,414
What if I won't get better?

484
00:44:06,189 --> 00:44:07,785
That's not good

485
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,492
It's no good if it's too squishy

486
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,836
If I die,

487
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:18,734
I don't know what to do about the damage to my house

488
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,516
What are you talking about?

489
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,540
You don't need to worry about that

490
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:31,468
I've caused a lot of trouble to the hospital and the medicine bills

491
00:44:31,944 --> 00:44:34,507
You've lived here since you were 13.

492
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,062
We are just like brothers

493
00:44:37,590 --> 00:44:40,590
Nobody thinks it's a bother

494
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:44,375
Thanks.

495
00:45:15,007 --> 00:45:16,905
Hello,this is Shizunoya.

496
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,953
Is your sister there?

497
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,280
I'm Yamashita.
Please call her.

498
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:36,711
Someone called you.

499
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:49,110
Sister.

500
00:45:53,257 --> 00:45:54,858
Yamashita-san is calling you.

501
00:45:56,094 --> 00:45:57,601
Say I'm not here.

502
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,367
I got two call from him today.

503
00:46:02,817 --> 00:46:04,429
Say I'm not here.

504
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:26,266
Hello?
She's not here now.

505
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:29,531
Hello?

506
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:32,429
Hello?

507
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:54,961
Welcome.

508
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:58,147
Good evening,
I wanna see Fukuya.

509
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,125
Please,thanks always.

510
00:47:03,092 --> 00:47:04,039
Good evening.

511
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:05,180
Good evening.

512
00:47:24,478 --> 00:47:28,397
Tae?what happened with Koji-san?

513
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,851
Did you talk to him about anything?

514
00:47:35,510 --> 00:47:37,656
Who cares about his mother?

515
00:47:38,305 --> 00:47:40,695
If you both love each other, why don't you just get married?

516
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,093
Koji

517
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:47,101
He hasn’t come to the city hall lately.

518
00:47:49,672 --> 00:47:50,336
Why?

519
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:55,226
Is Isehama there?

520
00:47:56,149 --> 00:47:57,281
I'm Kimi.

521
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:00,075
We're closed today.

522
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,265
He hasn't been here since this morning.

523
00:48:10,303 --> 00:48:13,436
I know that you and Kimi are dating.

524
00:48:13,928 --> 00:48:16,804
Don't say that, you are not even old enough to be jealous.

525
00:48:17,152 --> 00:48:20,609
Don't be stupid, I'm not a bit of a fool.

526
00:48:21,602 --> 00:48:25,214
I'm still a woman,.

527
00:48:29,574 --> 00:48:31,933
where are you going, ko-chan?

528
00:48:32,675 --> 00:48:34,173
Don't meet Taeko.

529
00:48:39,649 --> 00:48:43,784
She's such a playgirl.

530
00:48:58,516 --> 00:49:00,918
Oh yeah,There's a tax meeting

531
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:02,461
Why are you so nervous?

532
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:04,735
You're going to dance with Kimi, right?

533
00:49:05,063 --> 00:49:07,008
Hey,I get angry.

534
00:49:07,479 --> 00:49:09,555
I'm just an old lady,

535
00:49:10,551 --> 00:49:11,686
Hurry up and get going.

536
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,976
What are you doing?

537
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,328
Massage here.

538
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:18,914
Yes, yes.

539
00:49:23,047 --> 00:49:25,446
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

540
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,496
What were you doing?

541
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,250
I’m sorry.

542
00:49:32,577 --> 00:49:34,719
Were you at Kiku-tei?

543
00:49:34,744 --> 00:49:36,195
Don't get angry.

544
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,344
Look at me! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!
What's the hell?

545
00:49:40,598 --> 00:49:45,617
If I pinch you once more ,I will forgive you.

546
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:46,852
That's stupid, that's outrageous!

547
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:48,483
I won't play around with you! What a nasty accusation!

548
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:50,227
You are mean.

549
00:49:50,630 --> 00:49:52,420
What's the hell?

550
00:49:52,445 --> 00:49:54,346
I wonder if I pinch you

551
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:55,305
I wanna pinch you.

552
00:49:55,353 --> 00:49:56,680
It hurts, it hurts.

553
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:59,508
Thank you very much.

554
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:01,704
I'll cure you.

555
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,310
How is it? Is it still pain?

556
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,334
It works a lot.

557
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:10,899
That's right

558
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:28,586
Hello, I'm going to have to hurry up today

559
00:50:28,915 --> 00:50:29,977
Why not?

560
00:50:30,132 --> 00:50:32,384
I have to run around worrying about money.

561
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,609
My house is being foreclosed

562
00:50:34,813 --> 00:50:35,766
What's wrong?

563
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:39,219
Well, My mother did something stupid.

564
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:49,524
Is this enough?

565
00:50:54,775 --> 00:50:57,117
I might have to say goodbye to this house

566
00:50:57,799 --> 00:50:59,125
Isn't that okay?

567
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:01,547
They can't wait.

568
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:04,797
There's only one week left.

569
00:51:06,598 --> 00:51:10,414
Let's take this opportunity to quit this business.

570
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,571
But Fukuya is sleeping like that.

571
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:21,441
There's a telegram.

572
00:51:25,172 --> 00:51:26,047
Thank you very much.

573
00:51:28,878 --> 00:51:31,878
Yukiko will arrive tomorrow at noon.

574
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:37,572
Please come down to white line.

575
00:51:44,891 --> 00:51:46,821
Kyoto.

576
00:51:47,265 --> 00:51:51,086
Transfer to Kyoto Honin Line.

577
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:55,695
If you are getting off, please be careful not to leave anything behind.

578
00:51:55,977 --> 00:51:57,586
Welcome.

579
00:51:57,611 --> 00:51:59,540
It's been a while, how are you?

580
00:51:59,665 --> 00:52:00,852
It's been a while, how are you?

581
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,625
We came to Kyoto for the first time in five years.

582
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,461
I'm Daddy's Friend

583
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:07,386
Tomorrow I'll be at a university here and I'll be heading to Hiroshima again soon.

584
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,375
so I'll be able to hang out tomorrow with you.

585
00:52:09,444 --> 00:52:11,326
I'm like a guide for her.

586
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:12,745
I'll bring it.

587
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,219
Thank you. Well then.

588
00:52:25,088 --> 00:52:26,758
What's wrong? Did you have a broken heart?

589
00:52:27,797 --> 00:52:30,195
The other party's mother was against it, so it's no good.

590
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,930
They say it's because the status is different

591
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,641
That's quite feudal

592
00:52:36,107 --> 00:52:38,852
Destroy that with your own hands

593
00:52:39,585 --> 00:52:41,078
It's not that easy

594
00:52:41,922 --> 00:52:44,352
That's why I hate Kyoto

595
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,359
Even a woman like you will become old

596
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,633
Well, that's terrible

597
00:52:51,854 --> 00:52:54,300
Please come to Tokyo with him.

598
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,789
I will introduce you to my work.

599
00:52:58,462 --> 00:52:59,212
But.

600
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,274
You have to be brave, you have to create your own happiness.

601
00:53:07,157 --> 00:53:08,743
Look.

602
00:53:10,222 --> 00:53:12,313
Fortunately, Kyoto was not burned down during the war.

603
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,044
but I don't know if that was a good thing for the city.

604
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,899
The traces of the ancient history may have been preserved,

605
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,580
but in exchange, It's very feudal here.

606
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:29,742
Under those beautiful roof tiles, They remain there.

607
00:54:33,077 --> 00:54:36,077
I'm sorry it's been so long.

608
00:54:38,258 --> 00:54:39,789
What are you talking about?

609
00:54:40,367 --> 00:54:43,086
I haven't done anything to you.

610
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:46,625
Forgive me....

611
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,063
I can't even repay you

612
00:54:52,650 --> 00:54:56,039
Fukuya, please don't die.

613
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:12,414
Mom, there are 20,000 yen here.

614
00:55:14,508 --> 00:55:17,329
Please use them for something.

615
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:28,812
Fukuya, you are...

616
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:35,187
I'll send this money to your house

617
00:55:50,376 --> 00:55:51,649
Daughter.

618
00:55:54,252 --> 00:55:57,252
Thank you for always being so kind to me,

619
00:55:59,805 --> 00:56:02,805
Even if I die now I will never forget.

620
00:56:03,501 --> 00:56:04,696
Fukuya.

621
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:07,094
Get your act together.

622
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:10,524
Thanks.

623
00:56:19,055 --> 00:56:20,758
Forgive me....

624
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,087
Forgive me....

625
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:32,680
Fukuya.

626
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:45,770
At least you'll get to go to a good place in heaven.

627
00:57:05,028 --> 00:57:07,180
Ah... Fukuyama...

628
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:08,967
Hello, this is Shizunoya.

629
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,188
It's Kimi.

630
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,469
Yes, I understand

631
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,453
I'll be there right away.

632
00:58:47,154 --> 00:58:50,154
Why don't you take a rest tonight, sister?

633
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,055
Do geisha have Sundays and holidays?

634
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:56,828
It is the duty of a geisha

635
00:58:57,682 --> 00:59:01,538
Please stay by Fukuya's side tonight.

636
00:59:02,769 --> 00:59:06,711
Mom, do you know when the 2 million yen deadline expires?

637
00:59:07,257 --> 00:59:08,094
It's tomorrow.

638
00:59:09,461 --> 00:59:11,141
It can't be helped.

639
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:13,008
It'll work out somehow

640
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:19,984
That's right, it'll work out somehow

641
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:22,656
We will be kicked out of this house

642
00:59:22,985 --> 00:59:25,610
You are fine with it but I can't accept it.

643
00:59:48,808 --> 00:59:50,294
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

644
00:59:56,545 --> 00:59:58,068
What's wrong?

645
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:03,631
I've run so far.

646
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:06,530
Please drink.

647
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:11,983
Oh yeah.

648
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:17,600
This is the 2 million yen we promised.

649
01:00:18,061 --> 01:00:19,663
Thank you very much.

650
01:00:19,902 --> 01:00:21,694
I won't have to be homeless.

651
01:00:21,912 --> 01:00:23,966
Please cut ties with Sokushingan.

652
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:28,256
Please cut ties with Kikutei too.

653
01:00:28,441 --> 01:00:31,107
I've already cut ties with them.

654
01:00:36,278 --> 01:00:37,389
Let's do dancing.

655
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,304
Oh yeah.

656
01:01:22,854 --> 01:01:23,659
It hurts me.

657
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:25,887
I’m sorry.

658
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:38,668
Please treat me nice forever.

659
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:40,902
Let's be friends forever.

660
01:01:44,973 --> 01:01:47,074
Support our next event.

661
01:01:47,099 --> 01:01:49,036
I'll be with you.
Don't worry.

662
01:01:57,137 --> 01:01:58,098
What's wrong?

663
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:02,380
What are you doing?

664
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:09,184
Why did you do this?

665
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:13,988
I heard that Kikutei is very prestigious.

666
01:02:14,757 --> 01:02:17,996
But you came into the other room without permission.

667
01:02:18,090 --> 01:02:19,020
What?

668
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,199
You are vulgar inclination geisha.

669
01:02:21,846 --> 01:02:25,340
You lost your man to a woman like that.

670
01:02:26,052 --> 01:02:29,403
Please show me your stupid face.

671
01:02:31,762 --> 01:02:32,895
You said it.

672
01:02:33,304 --> 01:02:34,824
Stop it!

673
01:02:36,197 --> 01:02:37,606
What are you doing?

674
01:02:39,528 --> 01:02:41,216
What are you doing?

675
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:43,504
Stop it!

676
01:03:07,582 --> 01:03:08,745
Stop it!

677
01:03:09,731 --> 01:03:10,949
Let's go home.

678
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:14,106
Isehama-san, Are you off to home?

679
01:03:14,316 --> 01:03:15,840
Yes.

680
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,926
And what are you going to do now?

681
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:21,731
I got call for Kimi.

682
01:03:29,647 --> 01:03:31,282
We are in the business of fighting for men.

683
01:03:33,432 --> 01:03:35,653
I'm frustrated

684
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:38,520
what happened?

685
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:39,474
Nothing.

686
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:43,208
It's me.

687
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:46,301
Please make arrangements somehow

688
01:03:46,870 --> 01:03:49,811
Yamashita-san says he wants to meet you.

689
01:03:57,678 --> 01:03:58,914
I'll be waiting for you at Umenoya.

690
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:02,234
Please wait for me.

691
01:04:05,077 --> 01:04:06,977
I'll just come over for a bit

692
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:08,243
It's just a little.

693
01:04:13,812 --> 01:04:14,586
Kimi.

694
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:18,649
Me?

695
01:04:22,097 --> 01:04:23,516
I'm Kasama.

696
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:26,209
I was wondering who it was,

697
01:04:27,104 --> 01:04:27,924
I'm doing this.

698
01:04:28,921 --> 01:04:30,845
When did it start?

699
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:32,559
Today is the opening day of the store.

700
01:04:32,691 --> 01:04:34,399
so I'll be able to get a drink.

701
01:04:34,424 --> 01:04:35,559
Please feel free to come.

702
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:45,679
I am honored to have you celebrate with me on my opening day.

703
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:49,215
Here it is.

704
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,775
I will come again.

705
01:05:03,244 --> 01:05:03,861
I see

706
01:05:04,431 --> 01:05:05,009
Take it.

707
01:05:05,315 --> 01:05:07,259
I'll serve you today

708
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:10,186
What are you talking about?
You have to take it.

709
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,681
Keep working.

710
01:05:14,783 --> 01:05:15,478
Thank you very much.

711
01:05:28,399 --> 01:05:29,485
It's been a long time since we last met, isn't it?

712
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,361
What have you been doing?

713
01:05:33,751 --> 01:05:37,188
You never met me

714
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:42,305
I was very busy practicing for the event.

715
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:47,735
You seem to be in a very passionate relationship with Isehama

716
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,056
Please stop saying stupid things

717
01:05:51,370 --> 01:05:56,821
I hate guys these days.

718
01:05:57,248 --> 01:05:58,173
That's enough.

719
01:06:01,133 --> 01:06:05,899
Actually, I came here today to ask you a favor.

720
01:06:07,056 --> 01:06:08,439
Would you mind listening to me?

721
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,298
I don't know what kind of good things it is,

722
01:06:13,270 --> 01:06:15,853
but please tell me.

723
01:06:22,988 --> 01:06:25,462
Please lend me 50,000 yen.

724
01:06:26,103 --> 01:06:26,814
I can't.

725
01:06:27,594 --> 01:06:30,030
I don't have that kind of money.

726
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:32,476
I beg you.

727
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,801
I'm going to quit my job and go independent.

728
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:39,896
Can you go independent for just 50,000 yen?

729
01:06:41,639 --> 01:06:44,639
Actually, I got fired from Sokushingan.

730
01:06:46,536 --> 01:06:49,536
The money I spent was discovered

731
01:06:50,259 --> 01:06:54,247
What a fool you did. Did you buy a horse or something?

732
01:06:55,130 --> 01:06:57,457
The money I spent is to see you.

733
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:00,556
Is it my responsibility?

734
01:07:01,113 --> 01:07:01,813
No but...

735
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:06,735
but I completely ruined the store where I worked for 20 years because of you

736
01:07:07,130 --> 01:07:09,042
Please don't make such baseless accusations

737
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:11,273
It sounds like I am bad.

738
01:07:13,546 --> 01:07:17,490
I know about it.

739
01:07:23,347 --> 01:07:24,167
Kimi.

740
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:29,360
I'd like you to help me out, so could you please give me 50,000 yen?

741
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:33,140
Starting tomorrow, my wife and children will be in trouble

742
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,247
I need your help.

743
01:07:36,910 --> 01:07:37,950
I turn down.

744
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:42,575
Please don't bully me too much.
I am such a weak woman.

745
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:44,312
I beg you.

746
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:50,651
My last hope is in you, please help me

747
01:07:51,940 --> 01:07:53,996
You are man.

748
01:07:54,020 --> 01:07:55,724
Please don't do anything embarrassing like that

749
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:59,170
Please.

750
01:08:00,223 --> 01:08:00,765
Kimi.

751
01:08:02,232 --> 01:08:03,105
I can't.

752
01:08:06,377 --> 01:08:10,352
You're too cold.

753
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:14,134
that's a man's one-liner.

754
01:08:15,012 --> 01:08:16,552
You bought a woman's body with money

755
01:08:17,309 --> 01:08:19,635
and now, please help me?

756
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,866
Where is the selfishness in that?

757
01:08:22,162 --> 01:08:24,002
The money I spent on you was 500,000 to 1 million
yen

758
01:08:24,110 --> 01:08:26,596
I was offering my precious body

759
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,314
Even though you have a wife and children,
you still go to geisha parties

760
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:34,065
Learn your lesson and take time to reflect on your actions

761
01:08:34,144 --> 01:08:34,817
Wait.

762
01:08:35,617 --> 01:08:36,291
What?

763
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:54,627
You'll hit me?

764
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,474
You'll kill me?

765
01:08:57,312 --> 01:08:58,992
If you had the courage, do it.

766
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:01,729
you would have gone to prison.

767
01:11:06,923 --> 01:11:08,410
Thanks for coming.

768
01:11:08,435 --> 01:11:09,460
Sorry for making you wait.

769
01:11:12,336 --> 01:11:16,087
Kimi is now really dating with Isehama.

770
01:11:16,959 --> 01:11:21,665
She had a fight with KikuTei's lady.

771
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:26,036
I can't believe Kiku Tei's lady backed out.

772
01:11:26,062 --> 01:11:27,122
Yeah.

773
01:11:29,740 --> 01:11:33,273
Excuse me.
Your mom is calling you.

774
01:11:36,989 --> 01:11:38,517
I'm sorry.

775
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:50,875
What?

776
01:11:50,900 --> 01:11:52,465
Can you just go home?

777
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:54,511
It's almost my turn,

778
01:11:55,293 --> 01:11:56,920
but Koji from Kikutei is there.

779
01:12:07,626 --> 01:12:11,409
I'm sorry, I broke our promise.

780
01:12:14,550 --> 01:12:19,033
You don't need to say that anymore

781
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:21,747
Please understand

782
01:12:22,910 --> 01:12:26,851
In my position, I can't go against my mother's words

783
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,700
He came to say goodbye to Taeko

784
01:12:41,086 --> 01:12:43,453
That's right, sister, we've come to an agreement.

785
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:44,832
Don't worry.

786
01:12:44,995 --> 01:12:47,158
I have something to say about this.

787
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:53,705
You really love Taeko

788
01:12:53,986 --> 01:12:56,342
It's all up to you.

789
01:12:56,718 --> 01:12:58,190
You're free to do whatever you want, just take her somewhere and run away

790
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,009
Can't you do that?

791
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:06,492
Or maybe you never truly fell in love with Taeko from the first.

792
01:13:07,045 --> 01:13:07,752
I love her.

793
01:13:08,056 --> 01:13:10,573
Then you should protect her.

794
01:13:12,147 --> 01:13:14,065
If you have any concerns about your life, I am here to support you.

795
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,684
I'll take care of her for the rest of your life.

796
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:20,568
Kimi, I'm an adopted child

797
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:33,285
We are doing this kind of business.

798
01:13:33,810 --> 01:13:36,810
I want Taeko to find a proper happiness

799
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:40,031
Please marry her.

800
01:13:41,078 --> 01:13:42,685
Please.

801
01:13:44,470 --> 01:13:47,470
Please forgive me.

802
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:50,720
I'm no good

803
01:13:57,009 --> 01:13:58,625
It is your turn.

804
01:13:58,650 --> 01:14:00,083
Please hurry up and get ready

805
01:14:08,256 --> 01:14:09,750
Sorry,Tae.

806
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:56,060
Mommy, don't worry.

807
01:14:56,620 --> 01:14:57,797
Now I can give up.

808
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:01,690
Please give up.

809
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:23,801
Please.

810
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,136
Please hurry up and take care of me.

811
01:15:31,229 --> 01:15:32,036
I get it.

812
01:15:40,094 --> 01:15:42,373
It's almost your turn.

813
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:43,346
Thanks.

814
01:17:05,102 --> 01:17:05,847
What's wrong?

815
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:45,445
Is it okay to be awake?

816
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,722
Today I was allowed.

817
01:21:55,374 --> 01:21:58,374
She's made up her mind.

818
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:00,848
Are you going?

819
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:05,016
I don't know what kind of life awaits me in Tokyo,

820
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:06,433
but I'll go.

821
01:22:07,332 --> 01:22:09,066
Do what you want.

822
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:13,769
You're not like us. You don't belong here.

823
01:22:13,863 --> 01:22:15,363
You can leave.

824
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:18,519
You'll have to try everything to find out.

825
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,566
You know what?

826
01:22:25,417 --> 01:22:26,238
What?

827
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:29,511
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

828
01:22:35,783 --> 01:22:37,152
Please in.

829
01:22:40,395 --> 01:22:42,262
I will go with him.

830
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:49,480
I'm sorry the other day,Kimi.

831
01:22:52,687 --> 01:22:54,971
I'm sorry too.

832
01:22:55,176 --> 01:22:56,332
Forgive me.

833
01:22:58,641 --> 01:23:01,964
Big sis, we don't have much time left.

834
01:23:02,785 --> 01:23:03,902
Take care and do your best.

835
01:23:05,027 --> 01:23:07,363
Please take care of her.

836
01:23:23,181 --> 01:23:27,707
Big sis, you should go and see Yamashita-san once

837
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:29,996
He's in Yamashina Prison.

838
01:23:31,017 --> 01:23:34,017
I don't want to meet such a stupid guy.

839
01:23:34,922 --> 01:23:37,922
I want to start a new life now

840
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,066
What are you going to do now?

841
01:23:42,144 --> 01:23:46,901
Well....I'll think about it carefully

842
01:23:47,540 --> 01:23:49,097
You too, do your best.

843
01:24:12,777 --> 01:24:14,332
Take care and do your best.

844
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,449
Well then we are off.

845
01:24:27,793 --> 01:24:28,746
See you.

846
01:26:33,931 --> 01:26:41,910
THE END

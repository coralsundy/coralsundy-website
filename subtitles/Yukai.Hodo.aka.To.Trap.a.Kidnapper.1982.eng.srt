00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:03,097
Stop it!

5
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,223
Cut it out!

6
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,941
You'll get in trouble again.

7
00:01:15,142 --> 00:01:18,738
Are you still mad?
Come on, Kaori-chan.

8
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,116
<i>Here.</i>

9
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,315
Try it.

10
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:34,823
Ow!

11
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:13,325
<i>I'm home!</i>

12
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:15,129
Welcome home!

13
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,659
Leon, Leon, paw!

14
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:50,933

<i>Last stop, Takarazuka.</i>

<i>Train heading to Osaka Umeda.</i>

TO TRAP A KIDNAPPER

19
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:57,669
<i>In Osaka, winter has arrived and the</i>
<i>chill has suddenly taken over.</i>

20
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:01,108
<i>At such a time, the news of</i>
<i>a dear friends passing...</i>

21
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:03,873
<i>Even my heart feels the chill.</i>

22
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:08,579
That person is a hostess at a bar
I frequented called Sonesagi.

23
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,487
Oh my, Oh-san!
You came all the way from Kobe!

24
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:17,324
It's been 30 years since I went to the bar.
Just when I was starting out as a journalist.

25
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:22,129
When I made a mistake she comforted
me, and when I reported a scoop,

26
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:24,621
she rejoiced as if it happened to her.

27
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,691
With her support,

28
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,667
I was able to become a
decent journalist.

29
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:36,406
That's right. She was the perfect mother figure
for a journalist who was just starting out.

30
00:04:37,878 --> 00:04:42,782
She found out about her
cancer last December.

31
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,153
She was born in Uwajima,
Ehime Prefecture.

32
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:49,146
When she was young, she was
adopted by her relatives.

33
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,521
She got married in the country,
but then got quickly divorced.

34
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,723
To Kyushu, and then to Osaka.

35
00:04:56,163 --> 00:05:00,066
A life she finally established
with much struggle.

36
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,700
I'm certain it was
disheartening for her.

37
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:07,106
We never even held hands,

38
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:11,070
but to think that someone so
good and honest is gone...

39
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,112
I am overcome with sadness
and anger.

40
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:22,122
Why are you crying!
She was a lucky woman.

41
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:26,184
This is the famous Yomiuri Newspaper!
And to have such a beautiful article

42
00:05:26,226 --> 00:05:30,097
written by the chief of the Social
Department is extremely rare.

43
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:34,865
That's right.
She hated crybabies.

44
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,767
Chief, come on, please.

45
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:40,007
Her favorite song,
"Dancing All Night."

46
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,842
- Please sing it for us.
- All right!

47
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,539
Hiromi-chan, cheer up.
You too, Naoko-chan.

48
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:52,510
Everyone, please drink, be happy and
have as much fun as you possibly can!

Thirty years...
I've devoted to being a journalist.

55
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:29,078
This bar knows everything about
my young adult life.

56
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:36,121

64
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:12,225
What? When?

65
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,059
Yes, understood.
All right.

66
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,759
Yes, I got it.

67
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:22,805
Captain, the Hogyo Police Department
informed us of a kidnapping incident.

68
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:25,072
- Where?
- In Takarazuka.

69
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:28,749
It's within the jurisdiction of the Hanshin Branch.
Oh, that's you.

70
00:07:28,749 --> 00:07:31,480
I'm heading to Takarazuka Station
right away. Let's go.

71
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,180
- Yes.
- Yes.

72
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:37,356
The Hyogo HQ should be making
an announcement soon.

73
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:39,552
I'm going to excuse
myself now too.

74
00:07:40,394 --> 00:07:42,056
Oh!
Thank you.

Get plenty of reporters on the case!

- Yes, yes, Kobe Branch.
- It's me.

79

Oh, Branch Manager, we were just
informed by the Hyogo HQ.

There's going to be an
announcement at 8:15.

81
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,898
I'm still in Osaka. The express train
just left. I won't make it in time.

I'll do my best to get
back right away.

Hi! I'm sorry!

92
00:09:36,777 --> 00:09:39,372
I was surprised because
you came suddenly.

93
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:42,082
I got a room at the
Takarazuka hotel,

94
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,484
so I thought we'd enjoy a drive
through Rokkogoe.

95
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:46,153
- Were you able to take days off?
- Yes.

96
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:49,214
I made a fuss and got tomorrow
as a paid vacation.

97
00:09:50,524 --> 00:09:54,291
Koutaro-san, my parents are trying to
have me in an arranged marriage.

98
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,593
My mother says she isn't comfortable
with me marrying you.

99
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,900
You're too busy,
Koutaro-san.

100
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,463
Because ever since you started working for a
newspaper company, you're always too busy.

101
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:08,464
That's why I wanted to have a serious
discussion with you today.

102
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,163
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Hey, Koutaro.

103
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,928
Hyogo Police HQ, an announcement
at 8:15, got it?

104
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:33,691
Hey!

105
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:37,135
The Captain is already on his way!
Run!

106
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:41,908
- Oh no...
- What happened?

107
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:44,173
- My contact lens.
- Contacts?

108
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:47,147
How are you so clumsy?

109
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,013
Um...

110
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,185
I found it, I found it!

111
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,710
- See, here it is.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,584
Gimme a break.

113
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:58,721
- Shape up.
- I'm still missing the other one.

114
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,125
Hurry up, then.

115
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:05,094
I found it!
I found it.

116
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,434
- Idiot, hurry up! Hurry, go!
- Yes!

117
00:11:20,747 --> 00:11:22,147
Ow!

118
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,256
Superman!

119
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:53,145
- Good job.
- They're here.

120
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,142
Um, I have a report.

121
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,850
There was a kidnapping incident
this afternoon in Hyogo.

122
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:09,963
The victim's Noboru Mitamura, 33, a pediatrician
residing within the Takarazuka precinct.

123
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:12,332
After graduating from
medical school in Tokyo,

124
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:15,235
he opened a clinic in
Nishonomiya two years ago.

125
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:19,866
He has one son and his
name is Hideyuki.

126
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,839
A private school in
Toyonaka City...

127
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:28,141
He's 7 years old and attends Toyonaka
Wakaba Gakuen, a private school.

128
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:31,882
As usual, around 3:30 pm,

129
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:36,151
as he was heading home from school,
someone was waiting for him,

130
00:12:36,323 --> 00:12:39,157
and kidnapped him
near his home.

131
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:43,929
Have there been any
ransom demands?

132
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:49,164
Um, at a little after 5 pm., there was a phone
call from a young man to the victim's house.

133
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:53,271
Mitamura-san's wife, Hisako-san,
27, answered the phone

134
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:55,275
and was told to prepare
30,000,000 yen.

135
00:12:55,275 --> 00:13:00,113
He threatened that if she contacted the
police, he'd relent on the money,

136
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,106
but she'd have to relent on
seeing her child again, too.

137
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:07,078
That's why we would like
your cooperation,

138
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:11,725
so refrain from gathering information
and covering the incident for a while.

139
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,795
We very much require
your cooperation.

140
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:18,231
You mentioned "for a while,"
but when do you expect for us

141
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,133
to be released from this
agreement?

142
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:22,830
In that regard, either when
the victim is found,

143
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:26,573
or when the kidnapper is arrested and we've
determined the victim's safety.

144
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,075
Or when the need to keep it
a secret ceases to exist,

145
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,845
and when those facts are confirmed
by the detective sergeant.

146
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,448
We'll no longer require your aid when such
reports are made at a press conference.

147
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:40,113
- Well, that sounds like news censorship.
- A child's life is at stake.

148
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,188
So, you've confirmed that
the child is still alive?

149
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,491
Unfortunately, not yet.

150
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,393
- So it's possible that he could already be dead.
- All we can do is...

151
00:13:47,427 --> 00:13:53,298
...do what we can and believe that the victim
is still alive until we have confirmed his death.

152
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,168
But Captain, the confirmation...

153
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:56,870
I believe that's all the questions.

154
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,240
We request that you report to your
superiors and consider our proposal,

155
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,041
and officially come to terms with the cooperative
agreement as soon as possible.

156
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:07,247
- We are counting on you.
- We will distribute the agreement,

157
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:09,478
and a picture of the victim.

158
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:21,722
Tsushima-sama, there's a
phone call for you.

159
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,396
Hello?
I'll put her on now.

160
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,501
- Here.
- Thank you.

161
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,937
Tomo-chan, it looks like it
will take a little longer.

162
00:14:30,937 --> 00:14:32,667
I promise to be there
as soon as I'm done.

163
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:34,669
<i>Please start without me.</i>

164
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:43,681
That took some time.

165
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,685
- Good work.
- Yeah.

166
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:50,986
- This is the Cooperative Agreement.
- What? Huh? Let me see.

167
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,856
- I've contacted everyone.
- I see.

168
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,123
- Everyone should be here.
- I see.

169
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,366
Wow, he's a cute kid.

170
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:03,894
The Hyogo Police HQ is rushing us for
an answer. How should we reply?

171
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:08,675
If a child's life is on the line,
we can't really refuse, can we?

172
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:12,078
We'll collect information within
the acceptable parameters.

173
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,877
It will be heavily restricted
in his hometown.

174
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:18,577
Hey, why don't you go to Tokyo?
Tokyo.

175
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,801
Ah, thank you for coming.

176
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:39,139
We will have Detective Sergeant
Narusawa in charge of this case.

177
00:15:39,139 --> 00:15:42,909
The investigation HQ will be at the Hyogo
Police HQ and all the developments related to

178
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,111
the investigation will be reported
from here. Thank you.

179
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,180
Will you send instructions for
the investigation from here too?

180
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:50,350
No, we've set up a command
center at the Takarazuka Branch.

181
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,287
Investigative Chief Kenmochi
is heading there now.

182
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,720
All right.

183
00:16:11,104 --> 00:16:13,373
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

184
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,943
If we knew this would happen,
we would have taken the train.

185
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:20,277
It'll be tomorrow morning by the
time we get to Takarazuka.

186
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,707
What?

187
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,184
- It's a police car.
- Okay, got it.

188
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,879
Follow it.

189
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,616
- Wouldn't we get in trouble?
- It's all right, just do it.

190
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,195
- Hurry!
- Okay!

191
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,460
- I'm counting on you.
- Yes!

192
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,462
Captain, excuse me.
Captain.

193
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,672
I am not going to permit news coverage
here. Have them go home.

194
00:17:19,672 --> 00:17:20,662
Yes, sir.

195
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,939
- I need to go to the restroom.
- I need to use the restroom.

196
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,919
Has there been any contact
from the kidnapper?

197
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:35,184
N-no, not yet.

198
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,387
<i>Victim's home - Mitamura</i>

199
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,521

202

<i>Actually, I heard that Takuue-sensei</i>
<i>is leaving the school.</i>

<i>She's getting married.</i>

204
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,279
- Hey!
<i>- I've talked to Nishina-san's wife too.</i>

205
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,046
<i>And we were wondering if we need</i>
<i>to get her a wedding gift.</i>

206
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,846
<i>So how about tomorrow?</i>

207
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:42,082
<i>- Can we stop by?</i>
- I understand.

208
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:46,090
Um, tomorrow is...

209
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,095
...no good.

210
00:18:51,564 --> 00:18:54,133
I'll leave the gift up to you

Yes?

219
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:35,108
Yes, Takarazuka Shinohhashi.

<i>When you cross the bridge,</i>
<i>there's a construction site.</i>

<i>Get rid of the cab there.</i>

How is my son doing?!

225
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:51,124
Um, he has a cold right
now. So...

226
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,459
<i>If you come to the power shovel,</i>

Hello? Hello?
Hello...?

229
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,694
- How is it?
- No, we couldn't get it.

230
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:07,629
This is the Victim Countermeasure Team.
We just had a call from the kidnapper.

231
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:11,744
<i>Takarazuka Shinohhashi.</i>
<i>A construction site up ahead.</i>

<i>Power shovel is the target.</i>

233
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:30,428
This is Ariga from the Pursuit Team.

234
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,160
We'll be at the destination
in 5 minutes.

No! No! No!

No good!
What are all these articles?

240
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:47,366
"Great Work by Police,
Kidnapper Captured."

241
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,599
"Hideyuki-chan Safe, Parents Cry for Joy."
They're all happy endings.

242
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:54,363
Make sure you have one
ready where the kid dies.

243
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,175
- I can't!
- What?

244
00:22:56,175 --> 00:22:58,044
We don't know if he'll
be killed yet.

245
00:22:58,044 --> 00:23:00,604
- Of course.
- Maybe he's alive.

246
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,115
Can we just kill him and
write about it?

247
00:23:03,115 --> 00:23:05,584
Think about the parents' feelings.

248
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,813
- It's too cruel.
- Are you stupid?!

249
00:23:08,154 --> 00:23:11,886
If it's true, you write about
it, no matter how cruel.
That's what a journalist does!

250
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:15,383
If you think it's cruel, then
blame the kidnapper!

251
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,925
Understood?!
Make sure it's ready by tomorrow morning!

252
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,860
Yes, hello?

253

- Yes.

255
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,098
This. Take it.

256
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:34,345
- Hello?
- Koutaro-san, will you really come?

257
00:23:34,814 --> 00:23:35,873
You'll come, won't you?

258
00:23:46,492 --> 00:23:49,121
I see, it's really late already.

259
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,260
I understand.

260
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,629
See you tomorrow.

261
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,798
Good night.

262
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:34,501
<i>In most instances, the victims get killed</i>
<i>right after they're kidnapped.</i>

263
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,801
<i>That's usually the case.</i>

264
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,528
Hello, it's me.

265
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:01,801
Looks like I need to stay
for a few days.

266
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,133
Yes.

267
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:07,265
Is the fever down?
Oh, I see.

268
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,175
Take care.
Okay.

269
00:25:10,743 --> 00:25:13,235
- Is your wife sick?
- Huh? Oh, no.

270
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:16,345
Our son got an eye surgery.

271
00:25:17,116 --> 00:25:19,517
It's not a big deal.

272
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,521
But he's the same age as the
boy that was kidnapped.

273
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,422
So, I just wanted to check in.

274
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:27,126
All right, I'm going to
get some shut eye.

275
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:29,118
- Make sure you eat.
- Yes.

<i>desperate wish, he was mercilessly killed...</i>

277
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,094
Captain, I don't think there'll be
any progress tonight.

278
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,267
There will be tomorrow,
so please get some rest.

<i>your dead kid.</i>

282
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:08,748
The kidnapper is hiding it well,

283
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,256
but he definitely has
a Kansai accent.

284
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,653
And there is a possibility that
he's using a car,

285
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,664
but he does need to collect
the ransom,

286
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:25,862
so we can assume that he is
situated

287
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,331
somewhere within a 30 to 40 km
radius of Takarazuka.

288
00:28:30,643 --> 00:28:34,480
Make sure to tell the patrolling officers
to tighten vehicle inspections.

289
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,116
Oh, and make sure to check
the trunk of the cars.

290
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:39,108
The kid could be hidden there.

291
00:28:39,285 --> 00:28:40,480
Yes!

292
00:30:38,137 --> 00:30:39,400

00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:58,153
My son.
Please let me hear his voice. He...

299
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,821
Better to see his face than
to hear his voice, no?

300
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:05,089
<i>Just a little bit if it's all right.</i>

301

An urgent announcement!

We signed the agreement, so we
have to refrain from reporting it.

306
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:15,834
But that doesn't mean
that it's okay

307
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:20,135
for us to just do as the police say,
do nothing, and take a nap.

308
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:24,009
We must have everything
prepared,

309
00:32:24,009 --> 00:32:26,979
so that we'll be ready when we're
released from the agreement.

310
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:31,110
But a child's life is at stake.

311
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,152
I hate to repeat myself, but don't get
within close proximity of the police.

312
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:40,683
Absolutely no direct interviews,
including phone interviews.

313
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,251
Just be extremely cautious.

314
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,631
- Social Section Chief.
- Yes.

315
00:32:45,731 --> 00:32:49,862
I'm sure you're already aware, but
I'm going to remind you just in case.

316
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:53,336
All right?
In regards to interview preparations,

317
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:58,172
the HQ's Social Departments, the Hanshin
Branch and the Kobe Branch,

318
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:02,471
these three will work as a team
and work out of Takarazuka.

319
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:04,745
They should all be there already.

320
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,364
Wow, the big honcho is
here in person?

321
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:21,767
- It must be some story.
- It's a secret.

322
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:24,803
- I know, I know.
- Hello, it's been a while.

323
00:33:24,803 --> 00:33:26,169
Good to see you too.

324
00:33:28,774 --> 00:33:31,141
Hey, please, come on.

325
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:34,674
What?
You've grown so much!

326
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,645
Hurry up.
Eat and take a bath.

327
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,909
Isn't there another kid?

328
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,921
Where's the outlet?

329
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:45,823
- It's under there.
- Oh, I see.

330
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:58,661
Yes, please.
100,000 yen or 200,000 yen.

331
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:02,432
More would be extremely helpful.

332
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:07,102
I'll give it back no matter what.

333
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,747
Please.

334
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:13,009
I need it before noon today.

335
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,082
The reason is...

336
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:22,758
...a life.
My son's life is on the line.

337
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,156
Yes, yes.

338
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:33,268
150,0000 yen? In cash?
Thank you!

339
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,468
Thank you.
I can't thank you enough.

340
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:39,474
Thank you. Thank you.

341
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:52,147
Come on, let's eat.

342
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:55,255
If you don't eat, you won't have
energy when you need it.

343
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,922
Yes.

344
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:31,680
Kaori.

345
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,214
- Okay.
- See you later!

346
00:37:38,323 --> 00:37:41,122
- Watch out for cars.
- Okay!

347
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:47,964
- Good morning.
- Ah, good morning.

348
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:50,127
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

349
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,763
Kazuo!
It's you, Kazuo!

350
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,770
Hey, it's me!

351
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:37,170
It's Kubo-da.
Did you forget?

352
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:40,076
We were together in high school,
Shinko-da Kubo.

353
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:44,813
Huh? Long time no see.

354
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:49,082
Did you come back because
your mother isn't feeling well?

355
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,917
In that case, can you give me a ride?
Okay, please?

356
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,550
This is great. Thanks.
All right.

357
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,762
<i>The sound of the loom brings</i>
<i>back memories, doesn't it?</i>

358
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:05,964
Yeah.

359
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,766
I'm a salaryman.

360
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:41,139
I work for a fisherman's co-op,
so the pay isn't great, but

361
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:44,342
the fishermen say if they didn't catch
fish we wouldn't earn a penny.

362
00:40:44,342 --> 00:40:46,277
Well, at least it's a stable lifestyle.

363
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:50,138
Your brother also gave up
being a fisherman,

364
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:53,718
and went to work at a factory for
a luggage company in Toyooka.

365
00:40:53,718 --> 00:40:56,620
Oh, over there!
Please stop there.

366
00:40:59,157 --> 00:41:01,149
Hey. Hey.

367
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,098
You don't know that Nobuyo Shoji
is back, do you?

368
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:09,463
She left home and switched
men a lot,

369
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:13,199
but one day she came back on her own,
and now she works for a credit co-op.

370
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:16,100
Can you believe that Nobuyo
is at a credit co-op?

371
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,138
Makes me laugh.

372
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:23,881
I'm sure she'll hook up with another
man and run away with his money.

373
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:27,710
Well, thanks a lot!

374
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:19,421
Mom.

375
00:43:34,813 --> 00:43:37,442
Thank you. Thank you.

376
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:42,120
You haven't eaten yet,
have you?

377
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,673
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

378
00:45:16,781 --> 00:45:19,417
My husband hasn't been back
the last couple of days.

379
00:45:19,417 --> 00:45:20,885
What is it about?

380
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:27,382
A promissory note from your husband to a man
named Moriyasu ended up with me, so...

381
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,354
Really?

382
00:45:31,496 --> 00:45:35,661
It's only 2,000,000 yen, but the
deadline is approaching,

383
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:39,133
so I want him to call me as
soon as he returns.

384
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:44,434
Please, have him call me.

385
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:07,087
Excuse me, have you
seen my husband?

386
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:10,562
I haven't seen him in a while.

387
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:14,267
- Has anyone seen Kazuyan recently?
- Nope.

388
00:46:39,097 --> 00:46:41,760
Hello, this is Furuya.

389
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,135
Is my husband there?

390
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:46,127
<i>He hasn't come recently.</i>

391
00:47:42,927 --> 00:47:46,830
<i>Hello, mother?</i>
<i>It's Yoshie.</i>

392
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:51,133
<i>Have you heard from</i>
<i>Kazuo lately?</i>

393
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,136
<i>Hello?</i>

394
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,563
It's me.

395
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,538
You...

396
00:47:59,343 --> 00:48:02,643
If you were going back home, why
didn't you say something?

397
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:06,181
I wasn't planning on it.

398
00:48:07,218 --> 00:48:08,584
Did you want something?

399
00:48:16,094 --> 00:48:18,359
I won't know if you don't tell me.

400
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:23,231
You...

401
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,600
You borrowed money without
telling me, didn't you?

402
00:48:28,606 --> 00:48:30,575
I don't owe any money.

403
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:33,474
But a man was here earlier...

404
00:48:33,511 --> 00:48:37,243
He had a promissory note that you wrote
to someone named Moriyasu.

405
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,115
That must be some kind
of mistake.

406
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:47,821
But he said to call as soon as you got
home and gave his business card.

407
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:51,788
I said that's some kind
of mistake.

408
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:55,491
Moriyasu must have used my
name without permission,

409
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,762
and did some things
behind my back.

410
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:00,132
Just ignore it.

411
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:06,072
Are you sure you don't
owe any money?

412
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:11,447
Of course not.
Stop worrying about it.

413
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,925
Sweetheart...

414
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:39,799
<i>Dear Grandma,</i>
<i>This is a holiday photo of Kaori</i>

415
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:47,942
Who were you talking to?

416
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:50,148
To Yoshie.

417
00:50:50,781 --> 00:50:53,546
How is everyone?

418
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:55,753
They're all well.

419
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:00,717
Kaori-chan must be tall.

420
00:51:01,459 --> 00:51:03,018
Yeah.

421
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:09,094
I hear she goes to a
good school.

422
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,514
Can you cut it?

423
00:51:33,357 --> 00:51:35,792
You used to, like this.

424
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:38,426
Here you go.

425
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:43,968
Um, I would like to take
the day off...

426
00:51:43,968 --> 00:51:45,766
Sure, that's fine.

427
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:49,136
- It must be hard for you too.
- Yes.

428
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,113
Do you want more?
Are you done?

429
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:02,913
- I'm done.
- All right.

430
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:10,314
Can I have two boxes
of cigarettes?

431
00:54:14,118 --> 00:54:16,087
And can you break 10 yen?

432
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:22,118
Here.
Thank you.

433
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:52,612
The money?
Is the 30,000,000 yen ready?

434
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,683
<i>Yes, it's ready.</i>
<i>How is my son?</i>

435
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,897
- He's fine. Stop worrying.
<i>- But I want to hear...</i>

436
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:04,969
Place the money in a bag and
be ready to go out at any time.

437
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:06,494
<i>Hello?!</i>

438
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,076
Kazuo!

439
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:20,317
The other one hardly ever comes home.
Why don't you stay here for a night?

440
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:23,521
There's been an emergency.
I need to get going.

441
00:55:23,521 --> 00:55:26,081
That's too bad.

442
00:55:27,258 --> 00:55:29,126
- All right then.
- Wait.

443
00:55:29,126 --> 00:55:31,118
Wait a minute.

444
00:55:39,136 --> 00:55:41,833
It was sudden,
so I have no gifts.

445
00:55:42,106 --> 00:55:45,907
Please give this to Kaori-chan.
Tell her it's from Grandma.

446
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:48,276
- You don't have to.
- It's okay.

447
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:50,141
Okay, go.

448
00:55:52,283 --> 00:55:54,115
Thank you.

449
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:58,155
- See you.
- Be careful!

450
00:55:58,155 --> 00:55:59,487
Okay.

451
00:56:35,326 --> 00:56:36,885
What is it?

452
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:39,920
Yes.
Is Moriyasu-san here?

453
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:45,132
Sir, you have a guest.

454
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:58,949
My goodness, what a surprise.
Please come this way.

455
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:00,781
Please, come on in.

456
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:02,580
- One hot.
- Yes.

457
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,816
Here.

458
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:10,517
It's all right.
You don't need to be so uptight.

459
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,429
It used to be your
husband's place.

460
00:57:14,098 --> 00:57:19,765
A debt collector came to
visit my husband today.

461
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,870
A debt collector?
I haven't got a clue.

462
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,075
Stop playing dumb!

463
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,443
That's harsh.

464
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,312
Just sit.

465
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:36,710
He said my husband is responsible.

466
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:39,123
He had a promissory note
of 2,000,000 yen.

467
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,422
There's no way you don't
know about it.

468
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:46,123
Sure, I received the promissory note
from your husband.

469
00:57:46,563 --> 00:57:52,867
But where that note ends up is out of
my control once it's out of my hands.

470
00:57:52,903 --> 00:57:55,668
It can be passed around,

471
00:57:55,706 --> 00:57:59,165
and it's none of my concern who
comes to collect at your door.

472
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:01,936
That's common knowledge.

473
00:58:02,813 --> 00:58:07,114
So he did do it,
after all...

474
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:11,713
What, you're his wife
and you didn't know?

475
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:15,559
Why 2,000,000 yen?

476
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:20,093
To put an end to that loan,
of course.

477
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:24,668
You tricked my husband
with the promissory note,

478
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:27,934
then you took this place from him and
now a debt? It's too much.

479
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,406
Stop treating me like a criminal.

480
00:58:33,077 --> 00:58:35,171
How about it?

481
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:40,442
Instead of being with that loser husband
of yours, why not be my woman?

482
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:45,088
You won't have to worry about any debt
and I'll take real good care of you!

483
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,518
Stop... Stop...

484
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:20,053
I heard from Nobu-chan.

485
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:26,889
It's been some time.

486
01:04:00,103 --> 01:04:02,095
<i>Kazuo!</i>

487
01:04:04,775 --> 01:04:06,676
<i>Kazuo?</i>

488
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:25,055
Kazuo! Kazuo!

489
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:28,523
Where did he go?

490
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:30,667
Kazuo!

491
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:40,133
What are you doing
with a child?!

492
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:43,142
Are you just going to abandon me?!
Bastard!

493
01:04:46,616 --> 01:04:48,016
Kazuo!

494
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:33,290
I need to pee.

495
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:36,156
Pee.

496
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,328
I need to pee!

497
01:05:45,909 --> 01:05:47,878
Pee!

498
01:05:49,146 --> 01:05:50,614
Pee!

499
01:06:05,729 --> 01:06:07,755
Come on, hurry up.

500
01:07:05,188 --> 01:07:07,054
- Fill it up.
- Okay.

501
01:07:21,104 --> 01:07:23,096
- Wait a minute!
- Huh?

502
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:28,068
- Just 20 liters.
- Okay, 20 liters.

503
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,691
Here.

504
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,358
Here.

505
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:48,356
Here.

506
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:56,123
I like bread with cream.

507
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:59,131
But I like ones with jam better.

508
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,933
Six o'clock.
"Amigo."

509
01:09:31,067 --> 01:09:32,865
Place the money in
a paper bag.

510
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:05,092
- That's strange.
- Something happened.

511
01:10:08,972 --> 01:10:12,465
This is Tashiro.
7 disguised patrol cars left quietly.

512
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:15,178
Were there any announcements
at the Police HQ?

513
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:16,908
Nothing.

514
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:21,818
That's strange.
Can you please call Kobe?

515
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,446
All right.

516
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:33,163
Yes, Kobe.

517
01:10:33,163 --> 01:10:35,155
Is this Aka-chan?

518
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:37,665
What? The police?

519
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,869
There are no announcements.

520
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:45,100
Ask the two undercover.

521
01:10:56,653 --> 01:10:58,588
<i>How about you, U-yan?</i>

522
01:10:58,588 --> 01:11:02,492
No matter what we ask, we get told
to get out, so we have no clue.

523
01:11:02,492 --> 01:11:05,595
You're supposed to be the snapper
turtle. Stop being pathetic.

524
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,597
You bite again and again
and again!

525
01:11:07,597 --> 01:11:08,932
Go ask again!

526
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:12,460
Contact Nabe in the box and have him check
out what's going on at the Hyogo Police HQ.

527
01:11:12,669 --> 01:11:14,570
All right, I'll contact him
right away.

528
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,937
Hello? Assistant chief, Nabe.

529
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,768
Urgent announcement.

530
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,777
Sixth call from the kidnapper.

531
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:27,182
"6 pm., Kiyoshikoujin 1 chome
in Takarazuka, Amigo.

532
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:29,618
Bring the money to Amigo."

533
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:33,148
Kiyoshikoujin...
Oh, this is it.

534
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:35,153
1 chome.

535
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,163
Here it is.
Right here.

536
01:11:40,163 --> 01:11:43,395
- Where?
- It's a café.

537
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:46,932
This is it.

538
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:33,138
<i>Team 2.</i>
<i>We're in place, as planned.</i>

539
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:36,341
<i>Team 3, in place.</i>

540
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:39,607
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Pay attention to all cars passing by.</i>

541
01:13:40,016 --> 01:13:43,851
<i>Command Center, this is Inugai.</i>
<i>Everyone is in place.</i>

542
01:16:59,582 --> 01:17:02,746
This is Kitagawa, Chief Patrol
Officer of the Pursuit Team.

543
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,254
No contact from the
kidnapper yet.

544
01:17:05,721 --> 01:17:09,920
A white car has cruised down
the main street three times.

545
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:13,963
Inukai Detective to Kuwahara
Patrol Chief Officer.

546
01:17:13,963 --> 01:17:16,865
A suspicious person found.
Confirm the number and report.

547
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:26,465
Number confirmed.
Kobe 58 sa 4561.

548
01:18:02,879 --> 01:18:04,074
Yoshie!

549
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:07,182
Yoshie.

550
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:15,615
I'm home.

551
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,621
Daddy's home!
Welcome home.

552
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:24,066
While you were gone,
I was walking Leon.

553
01:18:24,066 --> 01:18:26,058
Is that so?
I'm proud of you.

554
01:18:32,842 --> 01:18:35,878
- Kaori, bath.
- I'll take it after I eat.

555
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:37,369
Go now.

556
01:18:38,114 --> 01:18:41,482
- Kaori.
- I'll take a bath with daddy.

557
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:45,352
- Kaori!
- All right! Let's take a bath together!

558
01:18:45,421 --> 01:18:46,719
Okay!

559
01:19:47,516 --> 01:19:51,078
Why did you have to lie to me?

560
01:19:52,421 --> 01:19:56,324
I've finally come to terms
with our new life.

561
01:19:57,126 --> 01:20:00,119
We got rid of the bigger
car and dog.

562
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:03,663
Why try so hard to put Kaori
in a private school?

563
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:09,269
But you're still chasing the dream you
had when you owned your café.

564
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:14,866
Even if it's not such a flashy job, if you decided
to work hard, I figured we could work it out.

565
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,943
That's how I've managed
until now.

566
01:20:18,547 --> 01:20:23,212
But if you owe 2,000,000 yen
to a loan shark,

567
01:20:24,487 --> 01:20:27,514
it won't do any good no matter
how hard you work.

568
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,158
It's useless!

569
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:32,128
Hey, have mommy wipe you.

570
01:20:38,567 --> 01:20:43,130
If you could have just told me
from the beginning...

571
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:46,609
I just didn't want to worry you.

572
01:20:47,777 --> 01:20:51,578
And we don't have to talk about
this in front of Kaori, do we?

573
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:56,218
- We can talk about it at length later.
- Stop changing the subject.

574
01:20:56,218 --> 01:20:58,915
- Why do I have to change the subject?
- Aren't you?

575
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:01,147
You're always lying!

576
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,588
Go upstairs and get ready
for school tomorrow.

577
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:09,599
Tomorrow is Sunday.

578
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,862
- Just hurry up.
- Is dinner ready? I'm hungry.

579
01:21:13,903 --> 01:21:15,633
I'll be quick.

580
01:21:16,405 --> 01:21:17,429
Here.

581
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:27,510
Towel.

582
01:22:06,255 --> 01:22:11,091
I don't understand you
anymore.

583
01:22:12,628 --> 01:22:17,157
Are you really thinking
about Kaori and me?

584
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:29,872
I really thought about taking Kaori
and leaving today,

585
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:39,813
but unlike you, I don't have a home
or family to depend on.

586
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:46,121
I want Kaori to grow up
with a father...

587
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:22,094
I'm sorry.

588
01:23:23,766 --> 01:23:26,861
You have nothing to
worry about.

589
01:23:29,672 --> 01:23:32,267
I wasn't sure, so...

590
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:37,670
I couldn't tell you until now,

591
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,115
but I'll have the money soon.

592
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:46,279
I'll have over 10,000,000 yen.

593
01:23:48,157 --> 01:23:51,127
I'll buy back the café too.

594
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,264
Kaori wouldn't have to
change schools either.

595
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:05,097
There was a guy I took
care of in the past.

596
01:24:05,507 --> 01:24:09,740
He built supermarkets
everywhere,

597
01:24:11,914 --> 01:24:15,715
and he's going to lend me money
with almost no interest.

598
01:24:23,659 --> 01:24:27,619
I'm supposed to meet him
at a café at 8 pm.

599
01:24:30,132 --> 01:24:32,124
It's 7:30 pm. now.

600
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:37,101
I'm going to see him now.

601
01:24:37,373 --> 01:24:39,638
I'll bring home good news.

602
01:24:49,451 --> 01:24:51,113
Oh, no.

603
01:24:53,322 --> 01:24:55,757
I left my wallet somewhere.

604
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:58,320
Can you lend me
10,000 yen?

605
01:24:58,761 --> 01:25:01,230
- You've got to be kidding me!
- Yoshie.

606
01:25:01,263 --> 01:25:03,960
Stop talking nonsense.

607
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:05,668
It's 30,000,000 yen!

608
01:25:05,668 --> 01:25:09,105
How does a man talking about 3,0000,000
yen not have 10,000 yen?!

609
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:11,404
I told you already!

610
01:25:11,874 --> 01:25:15,003
- I left my wallet somewhere!
- All right!

611
01:25:16,078 --> 01:25:18,843
I understand, so stop talking!

612
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:20,476
<i>Yoshie!</i>

613
01:25:23,752 --> 01:25:26,722
Take everything!
Everything in the house!

614
01:25:26,755 --> 01:25:28,747
Everything here is yours!

615
01:25:28,791 --> 01:25:31,026
- Take everything!
- Yoshie, calm down.

616
01:25:31,026 --> 01:25:32,961
I'm telling you to take it!

617
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,798
This is the remainder of what
I made from my part-time job.

618
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:39,132
We haven't even paid Kaori's tuition.
This is all of it!

619
01:25:39,501 --> 01:25:40,869
- You haven't...
- I'm sorry.

620
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:43,072
- You haven't had any income...
- I'm sorry.

621
01:25:43,072 --> 01:25:46,099
This is everything!
All of it!

622
01:25:53,549 --> 01:25:55,415
Yoshie!

623
01:26:08,364 --> 01:26:11,061
Be good to mom!

624
01:26:18,107 --> 01:26:19,598
What's this?

625
01:26:19,675 --> 01:26:22,076
Hide-chan gave it to me.

626
01:26:23,545 --> 01:26:26,572
- Hide-chan?
- He's a good friend.

627
01:26:26,615 --> 01:26:31,076
He wasn't at school today,
so I couldn't play with him.

628
01:28:12,921 --> 01:28:15,049
Can I borrow 10,000 yen?

629
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:23,429
Your wife came this afternoon.

630
01:28:23,832 --> 01:28:25,767
She's a feisty one.

631
01:28:25,801 --> 01:28:27,565
I said 10,000 yen.

632
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:39,078
Sir, here's your change.

633
01:28:51,126 --> 01:28:52,458
Welcome.

634
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:59,668
What's going on?
So many couples I haven't seen before.

635
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,466
- I'll leave it here.
- Thank you.

636
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:07,065
Hello. Amigo.

637
01:29:09,077 --> 01:29:11,046
Is there a Mitamura-san there?

638
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:18,377
- Hello?
<i>- Hello.</i>

639
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:22,821
I've been waiting here since
6 pm., as promised.

640
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:26,895
<i>What are you talking about?!</i>
<i>You broke your promise,</i>

641
01:29:26,895 --> 01:29:30,229
<i>and told the cops, so I can't</i>
<i>make it there! Damn it!</i>

642
01:29:30,499 --> 01:29:33,765
I haven't told them...

643
01:29:33,802 --> 01:29:35,464
<i>Stop lying!</i>

644
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,573
<i>There's tons of cops there!</i>

645
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:42,071
<i>Hello?</i>

646
01:29:44,546 --> 01:29:49,109
Hello?
We haven't told the police anything.

647
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,011
Hello?

648
01:29:54,256 --> 01:29:55,280
Hello?!

649
01:29:55,591 --> 01:29:59,119
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

650
01:29:59,428 --> 01:30:05,993
<i>Please! Please trust us and give</i>
<i>us one more chance!</i>

651
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,366
<i>All right.</i>

652
01:30:09,605 --> 01:30:11,403
<i>The airport lobby.</i>

653
01:30:11,506 --> 01:30:15,136
<i>The airport?</i>
<i>The lobby at Itami Airport?</i>

654
01:30:15,644 --> 01:30:19,137
<i>If you go by car it's</i> quick.
<i>Wait there.</i>

655
01:30:19,281 --> 01:30:21,113
<i>Y-yes...</i>

656
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:25,917
<i>If I find the police next time, you might</i>
<i>as well give up on the kid.</i>

657
01:30:26,521 --> 01:30:31,026
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>
<i>Hello?!</i>

658
01:30:31,026 --> 01:30:33,695
Contact the backup team!
He may be planning an escape.

659
01:30:33,695 --> 01:30:35,097
- Captain!
- It's a bluff!

660
01:30:35,097 --> 01:30:37,265
There's no way he's aware
of our presence.

661
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,333
Itami Airport Lobby.

662
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:40,369
Why didn't the kidnapper
appear at Amigo?

663
01:30:40,369 --> 01:30:44,473
- He probably knew that there were cops there.
- No calls from the kidnapper?

664
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:48,210
The investigation is at a critical juncture
so please don't inquire any more.

665
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:51,380
But we suspect nothing else
will happen tonight.

666
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,839
Don't treat us like fools.
We're not that stupid.

667
01:30:55,617 --> 01:30:59,418
We've honored the agreement and
haven't interviewed anyone at all.

668
01:30:59,554 --> 01:31:04,288
In return, the police have an obligation
to inform us on a regular basis.

669
01:31:04,326 --> 01:31:06,124
That's right.
You're useless.

670
01:31:06,294 --> 01:31:09,856
- Get us the Detective Chief.
- This won't do.

671
01:31:14,269 --> 01:31:17,569
It's an urgent message from the
Takarazuka Command Center.

672
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:20,407
"A suspicious car spotted
in front of Amigo.

673
01:31:20,442 --> 01:31:22,604
From the license plate,

674
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:26,706
we've confirmed that it belongs to someone
who works for a newspaper company."

675
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:30,779
You talk about the agreement,
but you're the ones breaking it!

676
01:31:31,153 --> 01:31:32,712
Huh?

677
01:31:34,790 --> 01:31:37,885
The police are saying that
nothing will happen tonight.

678
01:31:42,864 --> 01:31:45,299
Hello, this is the Takarazuka
Delivery Office.

679
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:47,165
<i>Koutarou-san?</i>

680
01:31:49,137 --> 01:31:51,368
<i>I'm at Itami Airport.</i>

681
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,699
Why?

682
01:31:53,942 --> 01:31:56,070
<i>I'm going back to Tokyo</i>
<i>on the last flight.</i>

683
01:31:56,111 --> 01:31:59,138
<i>I thought I'd let you know.</i>

684
01:32:02,117 --> 01:32:03,551
I'm sorry.

685
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:06,511
<i>You don't need to</i>
<i>apologize anymore.</i>

686
01:32:06,822 --> 01:32:10,125
<i>You will never</i> quit being
<i>a journalist.</i>

687
01:32:10,125 --> 01:32:14,256
<i>I can't deal with someone whose job keeps</i>
<i>them from seeing their partner.</i>

688
01:32:14,496 --> 01:32:16,658
<i>It won't work out between us.</i>

689
01:32:16,832 --> 01:32:19,097
- Tomo-chan, wait.
<i>- Goodbye.</i>

690
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:20,432
Tomo-chan!

691
01:32:34,816 --> 01:32:37,843
You're on, Shiho-chan.
You're on, Shiho-chan.

692
01:32:37,919 --> 01:32:41,151
Mari-chan, too.
Mari-chan, too.

693
01:32:52,167 --> 01:32:53,863
Go and talk to her.

694
01:32:53,969 --> 01:32:56,131
What are you doing?

695
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:09,839
I wet my pants.

696
01:34:16,718 --> 01:34:18,448
Forget it. Forget it.

697
01:34:18,987 --> 01:34:21,320
You're not going to get mad?

698
01:34:23,725 --> 01:34:25,990
- Are you warm enough?
- Yes.

699
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:30,796
- You must be hungry.
- Yes.

700
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:35,133
- If it's bread, I like...
- You like bread with jam, right?

701
01:34:36,972 --> 01:34:39,100
I'll go and get some now.

702
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:47,782
I'll let you go home in
a little bit, all right?

703
01:34:48,617 --> 01:34:50,176
<i>Mister.</i>

704
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,314
<i>Can you take off the blindfold?</i>

705
01:35:08,103 --> 01:35:10,095
Wow, stars!

706
01:35:28,123 --> 01:35:30,683
Excuse me, excuse me!

707
01:35:38,266 --> 01:35:39,962
Here's bread with jam.

708
01:35:52,347 --> 01:35:55,840
Hey, I got you bread
with jam.

709
01:35:57,819 --> 01:36:00,118
Bread with jam.

710
01:36:04,025 --> 01:36:05,618
Hey.

711
01:36:17,872 --> 01:36:22,242
A kid won't last in this
cold temperature.

712
01:36:22,944 --> 01:36:26,972
It may take a bit longer
than expected.

713
01:36:27,716 --> 01:36:31,118
Well, why don't we get some
shut eye while we can.

714
01:36:31,252 --> 01:36:32,584
That's true.

715
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:40,117
Then let's get some sleep.

716
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:45,097
Oh, sorry.

717
01:36:53,975 --> 01:36:55,466
Thank you.

718
01:36:57,012 --> 01:37:00,676
I would love to show
my wife that style.

719
01:37:03,084 --> 01:37:05,076
Oh, that's right.

720
01:37:15,563 --> 01:37:17,088
Sorry.

721
01:37:19,067 --> 01:37:20,558
Yes, Takarazuka.

722
01:37:20,869 --> 01:37:24,567
It's me. I got information from Kakinuma,
who I sent to Tokyo.

723
01:37:24,773 --> 01:37:29,074
According to a branch of the police department,
something's happening tonight.

724
01:37:29,244 --> 01:37:32,737
The location of the exchange changed.
It's at Itami Airport.

725
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:35,407
<i>- At the ticket lobby.</i>
- Damn it!

726
01:37:50,465 --> 01:37:53,128
Tomo-chan, you waited for me.

727
01:38:13,655 --> 01:38:15,055
Yes.

728
01:38:18,326 --> 01:38:21,660
- You have to leave now.
- Why?

729
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:24,933
Come.

730
01:38:24,933 --> 01:38:28,097
<i>We have a message for</i>
<i>the following guest.</i>

731
01:38:28,603 --> 01:38:31,368
<i>Mitamura-sama, Mitamura-sama.</i>

732
01:38:31,539 --> 01:38:36,375
<i>Please pick up the phone at the information</i>
<i>desk on the first floor lobby.</i>

733
01:38:39,948 --> 01:38:42,110
The police are here!

734
01:38:43,418 --> 01:38:45,086
That's impossible!

735
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:47,122
<i>Who are those couples</i>
<i>walking around?</i>

736
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:50,115
<i>They were at Amigo earlier.</i>

737
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:51,591
<i>Those are cops!</i>

738
01:38:53,027 --> 01:38:57,732
Don't kill my son, please!
Please, save my son!

739
01:38:57,732 --> 01:38:59,496
I'll do anything!

740
01:38:59,634 --> 01:39:03,036
Please save my son!
Please!

741
01:39:10,078 --> 01:39:12,547
Hello? Hello?

742
01:39:49,551 --> 01:39:52,077
I'm cold. Mommy.

743
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,088
I'm cold.

744
01:39:57,592 --> 01:39:59,288
Cold.

745
01:40:06,434 --> 01:40:08,130
Cold.

746
01:41:20,275 --> 01:41:23,734
You'll catch a cold
sleeping out here.

747
01:41:26,748 --> 01:41:29,411
Mom, Mom!

748
01:41:30,118 --> 01:41:32,144
Dad came home.

749
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:35,155
He left with my water bottle.

750
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:37,722
He just left.

751
01:41:42,397 --> 01:41:44,161
Honey!

752
01:41:48,136 --> 01:41:53,803
Honey! Honey!

753
01:41:55,243 --> 01:41:57,178
Honey!

754
01:41:58,813 --> 01:42:00,839
Honey!

755
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:06,721
Honey! Honey!

756
01:42:08,056 --> 01:42:13,085
Honey... Honey...

757
01:43:47,255 --> 01:43:50,384
Die! Die!

758
01:45:34,295 --> 01:45:36,890
Hello?! Hello?!

759
01:45:40,334 --> 01:45:42,132
I killed the kid.

760
01:45:42,236 --> 01:45:44,671
It's your fault for notifying
the police!

761
01:45:45,773 --> 01:45:47,105
What?

762
01:46:00,087 --> 01:46:02,955
I've had enough of the kid.

763
01:46:04,058 --> 01:46:06,152
I don't know what to
do with him.

764
01:46:09,697 --> 01:46:11,666
Hideyuki!

765
01:46:11,766 --> 01:46:14,065
He's alive?

766
01:46:15,269 --> 01:46:17,338
Hideyuki's alive?

767
01:46:17,338 --> 01:46:18,863
Is he safe?

768
01:46:19,173 --> 01:46:20,664
He's safe?

769
01:46:20,808 --> 01:46:22,401
Is he safe?

770
01:46:24,645 --> 01:46:31,381
Look, this is really the
very last time!

771
01:46:32,620 --> 01:46:34,816
Your last chance!

772
01:46:36,257 --> 01:46:37,350
Do you understand?!

773
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:41,195
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

774
01:46:41,195 --> 01:46:44,359
Can we please listen
to his voice?

775
01:46:44,665 --> 01:46:47,567
That way we can calm down.

776
01:46:48,202 --> 01:46:51,138
<i>Is he eating something?</i>
<i>He isn't crying?</i>

777
01:46:51,138 --> 01:46:53,869
<i>Is he well rested?</i>

778
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:59,136
10 yen.
I don't have 10 yen!

779
01:47:01,215 --> 01:47:03,741
I don't have time!

780
01:47:04,885 --> 01:47:07,616
This is your last chance.

781
01:47:07,888 --> 01:47:11,052
<i>You better not do</i>
<i>anything to ruin it.</i>

782
01:47:11,292 --> 01:47:13,989
Yes, we promise not to let
the police come near.

783
01:47:14,095 --> 01:47:17,657
The money! There's no deal unless we
exchange the child for the money!

784
01:47:17,698 --> 01:47:21,066
Yes, so where should we bring it,
and what time?

785
01:47:21,736 --> 01:47:24,763
What time?
I don't have a watch.

786
01:47:24,905 --> 01:47:26,396
My watch!

787
01:47:31,078 --> 01:47:32,808
Not even 10 yen.

788
01:47:34,382 --> 01:47:38,513
- The place, the place.
<i>- Are you ready?</i>

789
01:47:40,655 --> 01:47:42,783
<i>In front of the car shop.</i>

790
01:47:43,858 --> 01:47:47,124
<i>Car shop!</i>
<i>In front of the car shop!</i>

791
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:07,638
- Please don't come anymore.
- No, we can't do that.

792
01:48:08,115 --> 01:48:12,678
Worst case scenario, you'll lose
both the money and your son.

793
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:16,248
We don't care about the money.

794
01:48:18,059 --> 01:48:26,058
If my son comes back
frozen and dead,

795
01:48:28,069 --> 01:48:31,130
but we hadn't given
up the money,

796
01:48:32,106 --> 01:48:38,068
what would I tell my child...?

797
01:48:40,781 --> 01:48:46,448
I won't be able to live
with myself...

798
01:48:48,089 --> 01:48:54,586
I just want to give the
kidnapper this money.

799
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:09,074
Detective.

800
01:49:11,345 --> 01:49:15,305
Do you have a child
of your own?

801
01:49:17,084 --> 01:49:21,078
If you have your own child,
you must understand.

802
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:25,924
Don't come with us.

803
01:49:27,194 --> 01:49:30,426
Promise not to follow us.

804
01:49:30,831 --> 01:49:32,459
Promise.

805
01:49:43,844 --> 01:49:47,281
Chief, is it really all right to let
them go by themselves?

806
01:49:47,314 --> 01:49:49,215
It's fine.

807
01:49:50,317 --> 01:49:52,081
Don't interfere.

808
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:56,947
What? They left?

809
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,617
I approved.

810
01:50:01,695 --> 01:50:04,096
I'm making a formal
request myself.

811
01:50:04,398 --> 01:50:06,390
Don't interfere with them.

812
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:10,501
Idiots!
The police have only one responsibility!

813
01:50:10,805 --> 01:50:13,172
To capture the criminal
that broke the law!

814
01:50:13,407 --> 01:50:18,141
But as a parent...
Myself, as a parent...

815
01:50:18,546 --> 01:50:22,316
Don't let your emotions get in the way.
Tell me where they're going.

816
01:50:22,316 --> 01:50:25,252
If we don't go, we lose the chance
to arrest the kidnapper.

817
01:50:30,691 --> 01:50:33,092
Tell me! It's an order.

818
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:19,864
It's almost 4 o'clock.

819
01:51:19,907 --> 01:51:21,773
- What's going on?
- You were still here?

820
01:51:21,809 --> 01:51:24,142
- Get rid of them.
- Say something!

821
01:51:31,919 --> 01:51:33,353
How annoying!

822
01:51:33,387 --> 01:51:35,947
I'm not backing down at this
point no matter what!

823
01:51:36,156 --> 01:51:38,148
- Hey, a patrol car.
- All right.

824
01:51:52,506 --> 01:51:53,838
Ow.

825
01:51:57,645 --> 01:52:00,706
There's someone
here already.

826
01:54:09,943 --> 01:54:12,276
Why did you come?

827
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,544
Why did you come?
Why did you come?

828
01:54:17,117 --> 01:54:20,815
Bastards!
Why did you come?!

829
01:55:24,218 --> 01:55:27,086
Hey, your driver's license.

830
01:55:29,223 --> 01:55:32,250
Show me your driver's license.
Didn't you hear me?

831
01:55:33,227 --> 01:55:34,752
Hey.

832
01:55:35,629 --> 01:55:37,097
Hey!

833
01:55:39,366 --> 01:55:42,131
I'm going to check
your trunk.

834
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:50,175
There's a child!

835
01:55:53,013 --> 01:55:54,606
Is he dead?

836
01:55:55,415 --> 01:55:57,111
Hey, kid, hey!

837
01:55:57,384 --> 01:55:59,649
Kid, hey, kid!

838
01:56:00,087 --> 01:56:01,248
Kid!

839
01:56:08,896 --> 01:56:10,888
Thank you, thank you!

840
01:56:11,064 --> 01:56:13,659
Then, we'll be going now.

841
01:56:13,700 --> 01:56:15,601
All right!

842
01:56:32,352 --> 01:56:36,084
Thank goodness.
Thank goodness.

843
01:56:53,407 --> 01:56:54,966
<i>- He's been arrested!</i>
- What?

844
01:56:55,108 --> 01:56:57,678
<i>- Emergency arrest.</i>
- What, an emergency arrest?

845
01:56:57,678 --> 01:56:59,546
The kidnapper was arrested?

846
01:56:59,546 --> 01:57:02,880
How about the child? Is he safe?
If he's safe, then we start interviewing!

847
01:57:05,919 --> 01:57:08,081
Hello, report!

848
01:57:10,057 --> 01:57:11,320
The child is safe!

849
01:57:11,692 --> 01:57:12,526
The child is safe!

850
01:57:12,526 --> 01:57:14,495
Good! A special report!
Sequel tomorrow,

851
01:57:14,528 --> 01:57:17,264
and then more on Monday.
We'll use the entire front page!

852
01:57:17,264 --> 01:57:19,399
So, we aren't bound by the
agreement anymore?

853
01:57:19,399 --> 01:57:21,368
- I'm checking now.
- Okay.

854
01:57:28,208 --> 01:57:30,911
You're being called.
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

855
01:57:30,911 --> 01:57:34,109
- Hey, who's covering the crime scene?
- Yes?

856
01:57:34,448 --> 01:57:35,882
- All right, you go.
- Yes!

857
01:57:35,916 --> 01:57:38,112
- Okay, I'll drive.
- Hurry up!

858
01:57:42,556 --> 01:57:44,115
Thank you.

859
01:58:04,444 --> 01:58:08,315
At 8:30, they've decided to release
us from the agreement.

860
01:58:08,315 --> 01:58:11,410
What are you talking about?
We're already on the move.

861
01:58:11,451 --> 01:58:14,154
What? Darn!

862
01:58:14,154 --> 01:58:17,391
What do you expect? If we waited
for you, nothing would get done.

863
01:58:17,391 --> 01:58:18,191
Yes, but still...

864
01:58:18,191 --> 01:58:21,127
The "News Coverage Agreement"
isn't "News Coverage Restriction!"

865
01:58:27,567 --> 01:58:30,671
- You're sure about the place?
- I think so.

866
01:58:30,671 --> 01:58:33,573
Can we really trust you?

867
01:58:36,276 --> 01:58:40,580
Yomiuri 94, 94.
This is Osaka Yomiuri 3.

868
01:58:40,580 --> 01:58:44,217
<i>We're driving down below.</i>
<i>Please guide us.</i>

869
01:58:44,217 --> 01:58:47,745
<i>Understood. The crime scene is on</i>
<i>the right bank of the Takeko River.</i>

870
01:58:47,788 --> 01:58:51,418
<i>Right by the mouth of the</i>
<i>river is a silver car.</i>

871
01:58:52,726 --> 01:58:56,629
The trunk's opened and there
are police surrounding it.

872
01:58:56,730 --> 01:58:59,461
<i>Got it.</i>
<i>Any sign of the child?</i>

873
01:59:00,434 --> 01:59:03,029
- No.
<i>- The kidnapper?</i>

874
01:59:03,537 --> 01:59:04,766
No.

875
01:59:07,741 --> 01:59:10,609
A police car just came up the
river bank on the right.

876
01:59:10,644 --> 01:59:12,704
Maybe they're in it.

877
01:59:12,813 --> 01:59:14,213
<i>Understood.</i>

878
01:59:16,883 --> 01:59:18,385
Oh, that's it!

879
01:59:18,385 --> 01:59:20,954
Kou-chan! You can take a picture
when we drive past by, right?

880
01:59:20,954 --> 01:59:23,090
- What are you doing?
- I have to...

881
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,958
That guy in the middle
is the kidnapper.

882
01:59:24,958 --> 01:59:28,053
Oh, what the hell?
Stop the car! What the hell?

883
01:59:30,263 --> 01:59:32,664
Hey!
What kind of driving is that?

884
01:59:32,866 --> 01:59:35,569
- I'm sorry, my hand slipped.
- What are you doing?!

885
01:59:35,569 --> 01:59:38,334
- Hurry, get that car out of the way!
- Raise your head!

886
01:59:45,746 --> 01:59:49,410
<i>It's the middle of the program,</i>
<i>but we have news.</i>

887
01:59:49,616 --> 01:59:53,086
<i>The son of a pediatrician in</i>
<i>Takarazuka was kidnapped,</i>

888
01:59:53,086 --> 01:59:56,284
<i>and the kidnapper who demanded</i>
<i>ransom was arrested.</i>

889
01:59:56,490 --> 01:59:59,025
<i>The kidnapper's name is Kazuo Furuya, 29,</i>

890
01:59:59,025 --> 02:00:01,728
<i>residing in Toyonaka-shi,</i>
<i>and currently out of work.</i>

891
02:00:01,728 --> 02:00:07,065
<i>It's believed that he resorted to kidnapping</i>
<i>after failing to manage his café business.</i>

892
02:00:32,359 --> 02:00:36,463
<i>The shocking revelation is that</i>
<i>the kidnapper is actually a parent</i>

893
02:00:36,463 --> 02:00:40,500
<i>of a classmate attending the same</i>
<i>school as Hideyuki Mitamura,</i>

894
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:43,800
<i>the boy who was kidnapped.</i>

895
02:00:44,137 --> 02:00:47,174
<i>Furuya has confessed to</i>
<i>learning that the boy's father</i>

896
02:00:47,174 --> 02:00:50,167
<i>was a doctor via the</i>
<i>school register,</i>

897
02:00:50,377 --> 02:00:56,408
<i>and he believed that with enough threats,</i>
<i>the boy's father would pay the ransom</i>

898
02:00:56,450 --> 02:00:59,420
<i>without contacting the police.</i>

899
02:01:00,554 --> 02:01:02,656
<i>At Toyonaka Wakaba Gakuen,</i>

900
02:01:02,656 --> 02:01:06,115
<i>everyone is celebrating</i>
<i>"Hideyuki-chan's Rescue to Safety, "</i>

901
02:01:06,593 --> 02:01:10,758
<i>however, the shocking news that the kidnapper</i>
<i>was the father of a classmate</i>

902
02:01:10,797 --> 02:01:14,256
<i>is creating a somewhat</i>
<i>gloomy atmosphere.</i>

903
02:01:15,135 --> 02:01:18,537
<i>Now, we will report from the hospital</i>
<i>where Hideyuki is being nursed.</i>

904
02:01:18,572 --> 02:01:22,100
<i>The press conference being held</i>
<i>there will be reported live.</i>

905
02:01:27,514 --> 02:01:30,848
<i>Mitamura-san, your current</i>
<i>feeling in one word.</i>

906
02:01:30,917 --> 02:01:33,614
<i>I'm thankful to everyone,</i>
<i>and I'm very happy.</i>

907
02:01:37,157 --> 02:01:41,652
It was my fault.
All my fault.

908
02:01:43,830 --> 02:01:49,667
I kept on bothering him about money.

909
02:01:50,770 --> 02:01:52,363
I did it...

910
02:01:58,512 --> 02:02:01,505
<i>You must hate the kidnapper.</i>
<i>How do you feel about him?</i>

911
02:02:01,615 --> 02:02:03,914
<i>Please be honest.</i>

912
02:02:04,885 --> 02:02:06,319
<i>I hate him.</i>

913
02:02:09,122 --> 02:02:13,126
<i>Hideyuki-kun, how was it?</i>
<i>Was the kidnapper scary?</i>

914
02:02:13,126 --> 02:02:16,858
<i>Smile. Hide-kun, we're glad</i>
<i>you're safe now.</i>

915
02:02:18,832 --> 02:02:22,132
<i>Come on, smile.</i>
<i>Smile.</i>

916
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:24,198
<i>Hide-kun, over here.</i>

917
02:02:49,496 --> 02:02:52,022
Kaori! Kaori!

918
02:04:26,393 --> 02:04:28,123
Hurry! Hurry!

919
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:37,137
Nakamura-san, you know where
the wife is, right?

920
02:04:37,137 --> 02:04:39,868
Please tell us.

921
02:04:46,212 --> 02:04:48,909
<i>You're hiding, right?</i>

922
02:04:49,015 --> 02:04:50,711
<i>We know you're hiding.</i>

923
02:04:50,750 --> 02:04:54,154
- That ruckus outside has nothing to do with us.
<i>- Isn't it your fault?!</i>

924
02:04:54,154 --> 02:04:58,148
Really. It's got nothing
to do with us.

925
02:04:58,725 --> 02:05:00,387
<i>Tell us the truth!</i>

926
02:05:00,427 --> 02:05:07,129
It's just that... Daddy needs to
go work in a faraway place.

927
02:05:08,401 --> 02:05:13,066
He won't be able to come
back anytime soon.

928
02:05:16,576 --> 02:05:20,775
We'll miss him, but you'll
be okay, right?

929
02:05:21,781 --> 02:05:25,616
Kaori...
Kaori is smart.

930
02:05:29,222 --> 02:05:32,926
So smart, so smart!

931
02:05:32,926 --> 02:05:34,661
<i>Tell us the truth!</i>

932
02:05:34,661 --> 02:05:38,621
<i>If you feel bad, why don't you</i>
<i>apologize to the victims?!</i>

933
02:07:05,518 --> 02:07:09,080
Kaori.
Kaori, get up.

934
02:07:12,192 --> 02:07:13,592
Kaori.

935
02:07:13,793 --> 02:07:18,094
Kaori, we're going to go to
Grandma's place in Tango.

936
02:07:18,531 --> 02:07:21,592
You'll go to a new school there.

937
02:07:21,701 --> 02:07:24,034
And wait for daddy to
come back.

938
02:07:29,576 --> 02:07:31,101
Here.

939
02:08:09,515 --> 02:08:12,383
I love my dad!

940
02:08:48,121 --> 02:08:55,119
<i>The wind is breathing</i>

02:09:02,669 --> 02:09:09,667
<i>It caresses the soft hair</i>

943
02:09:10,076 --> 02:09:17,074

945
02:09:33,299 --> 02:09:35,928
- Good job!
- Good job!

946
02:09:36,436 --> 02:09:39,429
- You did well, huh?
- Let's drink, let's drink.

947
02:09:46,346 --> 02:09:49,373
- How was it?
- I struck out.

948
02:09:50,116 --> 02:09:53,109
They must have gone
to hide with a relative.

949
02:09:53,419 --> 02:09:54,910
Hey.

950
02:09:55,655 --> 02:09:58,819
But it tastes darn good.

951
02:10:04,430 --> 02:10:07,332
- Really good!
- I look forward to the morning paper.

952
02:10:07,367 --> 02:10:08,995
You did well.

953
02:10:09,068 --> 02:10:11,663
- Good job.
- Good job.

954
02:10:15,908 --> 02:10:18,945
I guess we should head
on home.

955
02:10:18,945 --> 02:10:21,210
- Good night.
- Good night.

956
02:10:23,149 --> 02:10:26,415
Yes! Oh, Kama-chan.
It's me. Yes.

957
02:10:26,519 --> 02:10:27,782
What?

958
02:10:32,325 --> 02:10:33,554
I see.

959
02:10:37,497 --> 02:10:41,025
Our company was taken off
the police's reporter club.

960
02:10:41,067 --> 02:10:42,535
Why?

961
02:10:42,902 --> 02:10:45,633
- For breaking the agreement.
- That can't be.

962
02:10:45,905 --> 02:10:50,176
They say that 20 minutes before they
released us from the agreement at 8:30,

963
02:10:50,176 --> 02:10:52,745
one of our helicopters
was in flight.

964
02:10:52,745 --> 02:10:54,304
Here's the proof.

965
02:10:54,781 --> 02:10:58,274
Ironically, it's the picture in our
special edition. Look at this!

966
02:10:58,484 --> 02:11:01,220
"Photographed from company
helicopter at 8:10."

967
02:11:01,220 --> 02:11:03,122
So how about that white car?

968
02:11:03,122 --> 02:11:04,681
- Branch manager.
- Yes?

969
02:11:04,924 --> 02:11:07,120
- It's from the chief.
- The chief?

970
02:11:10,296 --> 02:11:12,965
- Yes.
- You heard about us being taken off the list.

971
02:11:12,965 --> 02:11:16,035
But we didn't do anything against the
principle behind the agreement.

972
02:11:16,035 --> 02:11:18,404
We took action after we confirmed
Hideyuki's safety.

973
02:11:18,404 --> 02:11:21,602
The agreement was for the sake
of the child, so it's all right.

974
02:11:23,142 --> 02:11:24,610
Great job.

975
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:27,540
It's quite a special edition.

976
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:31,484
It's the culmination of everyone's efforts,
despite the agreement's limitations.

977
02:11:31,484 --> 02:11:33,817
Great job. Really.

978
02:11:36,389 --> 02:11:37,618
Yes!

00:00:18,648 --> 00:00:28,171
Black Death Ball

3
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,124
Hello

4
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,305


5
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,656
How's Sakaguchi's injury?

6
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:33,266
He has a fracture to his left arm.

7
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:33,945
How is his head?

8
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:36,547
He was pissed off behind the bench

9
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,734
The woman he was with was a fashion model?

10
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,383
Hey guys,I'm not Prince Shotoku or Buddha.

11
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:45,117
Whose question shall I answer first?

12
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:48,242
What do you think of the state of the Boobies' aces?

13
00:01:48,273 --> 00:01:50,281
Don’t say things like that.
It might bring bad luck.

14
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:52,586
Sakaguchi's injury is no big deal.

15
00:01:52,633 --> 00:01:54,172
It's just a fracture.

16
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,313
A month's rest and he'll be ready to pitch.

17
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,188
I don't worry about him at all

18
00:01:59,492 --> 00:02:02,297
That's wishful thinking on your part.

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,750
Hey you,Do not look down our Boobies.

20
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,438
Besides Sakaguchi, Yoshida is also there. Kuroki, who joined the team last year, is also doing well.

21
00:02:11,188 --> 00:02:13,961
You should come to see our camp one day

22
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:14,961
See you

23
00:02:14,986 --> 00:02:16,305
Wait wait!

24
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,642
Wait,Nishio-san

25
00:02:17,775 --> 00:02:18,650
Please answer more

26
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:20,267
Wait,Nishio-san

27
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:21,713
I just need a moment of your time.

28
00:02:22,228 --> 00:02:23,017
See you tomorrow

29
00:02:23,283 --> 00:02:24,431
Please don't say that.

30
00:02:24,588 --> 00:02:25,478
I just need a moment of your time.

31
00:02:25,524 --> 00:02:26,087
Nishio-san!

32
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:32,369
There were many reporters

33
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:35,830
Suematsu, I think Sakaguchi will be hopeless

34
00:02:37,088 --> 00:02:39,588
He has ligament damage, not just fractures.

35
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:42,626
So He will be unable to come back

36
00:02:42,752 --> 00:02:43,392
Um

37
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,892
I figured I could use him for another three years.

38
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:48,806
So We don't have enough time

39
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,306
We need to decide on that as soon as possible.

40
00:02:57,213 --> 00:02:57,775
Good morning

41
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,775
Where have you been?

42
00:02:58,884 --> 00:03:00,783
You're not a woman. Long time to get ready.

43
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:01,884
I'm sorry

44
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:09,205
6 million in 1000 yen bills

45
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,314
Ok, We will go to Nagano now

46
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:15,939
If we put the money in front of him, Kikukawa's father would agree.

47
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:20,088
Moreover I raised the price a million more than they asked.

48
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:24,267
But We'll negotiate for the five million they're asking for at first.

49
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:28,048
If it doesn't work, we'll give him one million.

50
00:03:28,642 --> 00:03:30,830
And We'll have a contract with him by the end of the day.

51
00:03:31,009 --> 00:03:31,744
Does it make sense?

52
00:03:32,697 --> 00:03:33,228
Yes

53
00:03:34,509 --> 00:03:36,072
That's not a very motivating reply.

54
00:03:37,071 --> 00:03:39,907
You don't look good.
Are you being hangover?

55
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,570
I had a bad night last night.

56
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:46,844
But it's not a good idea to indulge in alcohol.

57
00:03:47,555 --> 00:03:48,883
That’s unlike you.

58
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:53,305
Listen to me.
Don't lose the next round of negotiations.

59
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:56,258
The Unions aren't the problem, the problem is the Eagles.

60
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:59,047
We've been losing to the Eagles lately.

61
00:03:59,984 --> 00:04:01,843
They have a lot of pride.

62
00:04:02,485 --> 00:04:04,813
Just make sure you don't lose the comeback at the last minute.

63
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,156
Yes, I know it

64
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,789
But I understand your painful situation.

65
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:14,805
Because you have to contend with Hamada, the Eagles who took care of you.

66
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:26,836
Hi

67
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:29,180
I met him last night

68
00:04:29,961 --> 00:04:31,602
You wake up early today

69
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,883
Why you didn't come?

70
00:04:36,129 --> 00:04:38,301
Hey,Why you didn't come?

71
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,535
I didn't want to answer you outright.

72
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,926
And there was a problem in the morning

73
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,418
What was the problem?

74
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:49,574
I don't feel like talking

75
00:04:50,996 --> 00:04:51,910
I see...

76
00:04:55,144 --> 00:04:57,043
I wrote this letter last night

77
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:01,324
I'm thinking of posting it now

78
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:05,754
It's a rejection letter, anyway?
I know it without looking

79
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,269
But I want you to read this.
I've thought about it a lot.

80
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:16,910
I've known you since you were working for my father's baseball club.

81
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,082
I used to think of you as a brother.

82
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,355
Then I can't believe you're getting marry me all of a sudden.

83
00:05:23,902 --> 00:05:27,879
If I married you, it would be boring.

84
00:05:28,371 --> 00:05:30,762
What did Hamada-san say?

85
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:34,074
I didn’t talk with my father

86
00:05:36,184 --> 00:05:37,598
I see

87
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,957
Hahaha I get it

88
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:43,652
I don't think I'm cut out to be a Scout.

89
00:05:44,293 --> 00:05:46,027
I couldn't scout you out.

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,863
I'm sorry

91
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,574
Ah...This...

92
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,613
I'll take care of it for now.

93
00:05:57,285 --> 00:06:00,082
Are you going on business trip?
Are you traveling for a long time?

94
00:06:00,215 --> 00:06:00,848
Yes

95
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,199
To where?

96
00:06:02,816 --> 00:06:03,754
I have no idea

97
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:04,801
See you

98
00:06:10,605 --> 00:06:11,598
Kashiwagi-san

99
00:06:12,785 --> 00:06:15,066
My father left yesterday

100
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,090
To where?

101
00:06:16,699 --> 00:06:18,535
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.

102
00:06:19,402 --> 00:06:20,660
To Nagano

103
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:26,316
Nagano?

104
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,551
Welcome

105
00:06:36,637 --> 00:06:37,730
Thank you very much

106
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,074
Hi senior

107
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:42,097
You had a rough morning.

108
00:06:43,254 --> 00:06:44,855
It serves one right

109
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:46,269
It can't be helped

110
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:49,128
But the quality of the players has changed, too.

111
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,801
It's a far cry from when you joined the Eagles from Towa Steel.

112
00:06:52,894 --> 00:06:54,309
I'll have same with him

113
00:06:54,402 --> 00:06:55,425
Sand-width and coffee?

114
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,941
But your leaders are also blind.

115
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:02,222
You could still be a player.

116
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,215
But they made you become a scout.

117
00:07:04,566 --> 00:07:06,340
Evert reporters say so

118
00:07:07,434 --> 00:07:08,652
I see

119
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,262
I think You have a hard time

120
00:07:11,144 --> 00:07:12,753
Even if it's for business.

121
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,206
You're the one who has to scout out Kikukawa.

122
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:16,910
You know what

123
00:07:17,066 --> 00:07:17,667
What's wrong?

124
00:07:17,793 --> 00:07:19,004
I'll get off next stop, Ueda

125
00:07:19,535 --> 00:07:21,144
Please take care of our bill

126
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,566
I don't care about it

127
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:23,816
You are supposed to go to Nagano, right?

128
00:07:23,871 --> 00:07:25,965
The Kikukawa does not matter

129
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,410
I hear there is better player in Ueda

130
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:29,840
Oh really?

131
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:31,504
Hey, Who is he?

132
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:33,590
Of course no comment

133
00:07:33,816 --> 00:07:34,723
Then see you

134
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:37,457
I'll play this piece.

135
00:07:38,473 --> 00:07:38,949
Ah

136
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:42,168
Amamiya!

137
00:07:42,324 --> 00:07:42,754
Eh?

138
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:44,285
Please connect me

139
00:07:45,027 --> 00:07:47,011
Hello, this is Kawakami of Eagles speaking

140
00:07:47,613 --> 00:07:48,152
Eh?

141
00:07:49,004 --> 00:07:50,301
Oh..Arizawa

142
00:07:50,957 --> 00:07:51,441
Eh?

143
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:52,761
Kashiwagi?

144
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,316
What? He got off at Ueda?

145
00:07:56,207 --> 00:07:58,019
So What will he do with Kikukawa?

146
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,019
I have no idea at all

147
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:03,199
Apart from that, How is your work?

148
00:08:03,605 --> 00:08:04,754
It's bad!

149
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:08,676
Actually, The Kikukawa is missing

150
00:08:09,082 --> 00:08:09,527
Eh?

151
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,184
I don't know where he has gone

152
00:08:11,535 --> 00:08:13,113
Hey, can you come back earlier?

153
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:18,707
You’ve got quite a bit of money.

154
00:08:19,074 --> 00:08:19,535
Why?

155
00:08:19,848 --> 00:08:22,785
Are you going to take a hired car and take in the scenery?

156
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,355
I don't have the time.
Hurry up,anyway

157
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:26,277
It's better to take a train if you are in hurry

158
00:08:26,754 --> 00:08:28,230
I have no choice

159
00:08:29,613 --> 00:08:31,699
Can you speed up more?

160
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:34,301
How long will it take to Nagano?

161
00:08:43,512 --> 00:08:46,285
He is not here?
You don't know where he has gone?

162
00:08:46,582 --> 00:08:48,652
No...ok..good...

163
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:52,785
Oh my god...Anyone know where he is?

164
00:08:53,184 --> 00:08:55,105
He's with the executive director.

165
00:08:55,316 --> 00:08:56,137
The executive director?

166
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:58,105
Oh He is Hiroshi's uncle

167
00:08:59,332 --> 00:09:01,590
I see.
He's with relatives.

168
00:09:02,926 --> 00:09:05,340
That’s horrible.
He is missing

169
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:08,348
Mr. Hamada came in a while ago and was in trouble.

170
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:09,957
Did he come?

171
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:13,402
I was told It's secret

172
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,668
Where is Hamada?

173
00:09:16,246 --> 00:09:17,426
Well...

174
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:20,496
Come...

175
00:09:24,285 --> 00:09:25,660
Do you know it, right?

176
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:26,973
Yes

177
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:30,472
This is the Sakai Hotel in Okuyamada Onsen.

178
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,644
Okuyamada Onsen...

179
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,129
Sorry to keep you wait

180
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:40,269
I'm sorry to visit you in sudden

181
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:42,433
Kikukawa has been absent since yesterday

182
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:45,973
I asked it already at his shop.
Do you know where he has gone?

183
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:47,918
Is he not sick?

184
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,746
Hun? He reported you he is sick?

185
00:09:51,894 --> 00:09:55,535
Yes, he called me he got bad cold

186
00:09:56,957 --> 00:09:58,434
Isn't that so?

187
00:09:59,316 --> 00:10:03,879
It seems they are having a family meeting.
Do you have any idea where they are?

188
00:10:04,894 --> 00:10:06,097
Well...

189
00:10:07,175 --> 00:10:08,613
That's horrible

190
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:12,379
I thought you know about it

191
00:10:13,598 --> 00:10:15,456
You think I'm hiding something?

192
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,629
I didn't mean that

193
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,074
I really don't know

194
00:10:31,894 --> 00:10:33,105
Actually I am...

195
00:10:34,371 --> 00:10:37,144
I will be leave this work

196
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:39,074
What?

197
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:43,348
I've had some bad days as a teacher.

198
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:49,113
The PTA took issue with me over Kikukawa.

199
00:10:49,138 --> 00:10:50,723
But it's all sudden

200
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:54,465
I'm sorry to ask you but

201
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:57,082
You've been bought out by another team.

202
00:10:57,527 --> 00:10:58,777
No way! Kashiwagi-san

203
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:00,207
Please trust me

204
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,051
I've done what I promised you I would do.

205
00:11:05,941 --> 00:11:07,652
I don't betray you

206
00:11:08,887 --> 00:11:14,871
I made an effort with the baseball manager to get Kikukawa to join your team.

207
00:11:14,934 --> 00:11:17,629
I didn't mean that I make you feel bad

208
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:23,394
But It's easy to be suspicious of people when you're doing this kind of work.

209
00:11:24,277 --> 00:11:25,340
I'm sorry,I apologize

210
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:29,629
Never mind.
As long as you understand my position, I'll be fine.

211
00:11:31,637 --> 00:11:34,668
I feel sorry that we become friend but...

212
00:11:35,707 --> 00:11:38,027
How about having a drink together tonight?

213
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:42,020
Unfortunately, I'll be on duty.

214
00:11:43,066 --> 00:11:44,910
I see. That's too bad

215
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:45,949
I'm sorry

216
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:50,965
But I worry about Kikukawa

217
00:11:51,613 --> 00:11:53,090
Ah..hahaha

218
00:11:53,934 --> 00:11:55,332
I'll leave my luck to the heavens.

219
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:11,020
Kashiwagi-san,Just got off

220
00:12:11,059 --> 00:12:11,566
What?

221
00:12:11,691 --> 00:12:13,684
Just got off the phone.
From Kikukawa

222
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:15,293
What?

223
00:12:15,816 --> 00:12:18,293
He said he will call you again at 6 pm

224
00:12:18,652 --> 00:12:19,356
at 6 pm

225
00:12:21,043 --> 00:12:22,160
So Where is he now?

226
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,145
I don't know

227
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:26,441
He sounded like his father on the phone.

228
00:12:28,074 --> 00:12:29,191
6 pm...

229
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,324
Welcome

230
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:46,832
Are you alone?

231
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:49,152
Please come in

232
00:12:50,855 --> 00:12:51,637
Welcome

233
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,527
Don't worry.
I will show him around

234
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:10,520
Did you come from Nagano?

235
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:17,168
I'm sure you must be tired of the bus shaking because of the road construction on the way.

236
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:21,527
It doesn't shaking all the way to Sakura-dori.

237
00:13:22,418 --> 00:13:24,223
Well..How do you like to eat?

238
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:27,004
I will have it late

239
00:13:27,121 --> 00:13:27,371
Yes

240
00:13:27,426 --> 00:13:28,277
How about drink?

241
00:13:29,106 --> 00:13:29,793
Whiskey

242
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:30,488
Yes

243
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:35,910
If you get a call from Nagano, please connect me right away.

244
00:13:35,935 --> 00:13:36,498
Yes

245
00:13:51,707 --> 00:13:52,715
Kashiwagi-san

246
00:13:52,902 --> 00:13:54,145
Do you eat mandarin oranges?

247
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:55,926
Is the clock at the station accurate?

248
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:59,231
The trains are always late.
Maybe accurate

249
00:14:04,465 --> 00:14:05,996
Hello? This is Kashiwagi speaking

250
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,637
Massage?
He will be late?

251
00:14:10,402 --> 00:14:12,840
I don't care about it.
Before sleeping, I will take it

252
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:17,277
Kashiwagi-san

253
00:14:17,504 --> 00:14:19,270
You're still young and you want a massage?

254
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,809
My body is stiff because of my habits as an athlete.

255
00:14:23,082 --> 00:14:24,934
So Shall I come here to massage you tonight?

256
00:14:25,293 --> 00:14:25,824
What?

257
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:34,176
Ah....

258
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:42,527
He has come

259
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,574
I said before sleeping

260
00:14:44,652 --> 00:14:46,871
Not The massagist but Kikukawa

261
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,418
What?

262
00:14:51,231 --> 00:14:54,356
We've got things mixed up.

263
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:59,590
After all,I think it's best if I leave my son with your ball club.

264
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:01,082
Right?

265
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:01,871
Yes

266
00:15:02,731 --> 00:15:05,160
Mr. Hamada of the Eagles and Mr. Kawakami of the Unions

267
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,238
We have talked with them carefully

268
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:10,441
But You guys have offered the best contract price.

269
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,059
But...

270
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,340
What's wrong?

271
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:21,324
Well...I'm sorry to have to say this but

272
00:15:22,168 --> 00:15:24,949
My brother and I are co-owners of a store...

273
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:27,410
What's wrong?

274
00:15:28,746 --> 00:15:30,340
Please speak clearly

275
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:33,762
Well, I'll take your word for it.

276
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:36,543
Actually, our store is on the verge of foreclosure.

277
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:40,356
We're behind on our taxes.

278
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:44,449
We borrowed money from a crook.

279
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,207
You may think that you should handle this contract money.

280
00:15:49,933 --> 00:15:53,847
We want to keep this contract money for my son.

281
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:56,941
Please understand our situation...

282
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,128
How much is that?

283
00:16:00,207 --> 00:16:03,598
800,000 yen, including interest.

284
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:04,543
Right?

285
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:05,051
Yes

286
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:08,324
To be accurate, it would be 813000yen

287
00:16:09,824 --> 00:16:10,957
I understand

288
00:16:11,168 --> 00:16:12,722
5 million for his contract

289
00:16:14,425 --> 00:16:16,238
We will add 813000yen

290
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:17,472
Thank you

291
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:19,504
Is there anything else?

292
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,066
Nothing

293
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:32,222
Oh you

294
00:16:32,496 --> 00:16:33,887
I thought you were back with your dad and the others.

295
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:36,238
What can I do for you?

296
00:16:37,949 --> 00:16:40,230
I'm sorry my father said that

297
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:43,042
Never mind.
It happens

298
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:45,980
That is not your business

299
00:16:46,582 --> 00:16:48,066
Hey, cheer up

300
00:16:51,058 --> 00:16:51,933
What's wrong with your hand

301
00:16:52,113 --> 00:16:54,824
It's nothing.
I was bitten by our dog.

302
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,379
It's not a big deal

303
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,855
By the way, I have a favor of you

304
00:17:03,855 --> 00:17:04,441
What is that?

305
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,699
How can I say no to Mr. Hamada?

306
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,769
You were scouted by Mr. Hamada and joined the professional team, right?

307
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,871
I've been scouted by Mr. Hamada, too.

308
00:17:17,168 --> 00:17:19,676
I failed Mr. Hamada.

309
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:23,465
I don't know how to apologize.

310
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:29,199
My father called Mr. Hamada clerically before he came here.

311
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:33,035
But I want to apologize to Mr. Hamada, too.

312
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:36,363
Ok, I get it, Leave it to me

313
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:40,832
I've hurt Mr. Hamada about you, too.

314
00:17:43,652 --> 00:17:46,183
Anyway Let's see you in Tokyo.
so Do not think too much

315
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,113
Yes

316
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:48,863
Hello?

317
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:53,168
Mr.Hamada has just gone for a walk

318
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:54,691
Who's calling please

319
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,636
Ha?

320
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:57,941
To Mr.Kashiwagi,right?

321
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,527
I'll tell him when he come back

322
00:18:00,552 --> 00:18:02,004
Some people like to take walks, don't they?

323
00:18:02,246 --> 00:18:04,301
He takes his walks on moonless days.

324
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:06,949
He said it was to sober him up after drinking whiskey.

325
00:18:07,285 --> 00:18:09,379
I think he went to the observatory in the back woods.

326
00:18:36,402 --> 00:18:36,902
Oh!

327
00:18:45,363 --> 00:18:47,097
Mr. Kikukawa called you at 6 o'clock.

328
00:18:47,887 --> 00:18:49,816
Mr. Kashiwagi called you at 8 o'clock.

329
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:52,879
Have there been any other outside calls?

330
00:18:53,176 --> 00:18:53,754
No

331
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:55,887
Did you notice anything else?

332
00:18:56,441 --> 00:19:00,629
Well...He was a strange man from the start.

333
00:19:01,176 --> 00:19:04,668
When I spoke to him, he had little to say.

334
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:08,558
When he was at dinner....

335
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:15,824
I will take a walk later

336
00:19:17,332 --> 00:19:19,176
It will help me sober up.

337
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:24,449
Can I climb the mountain behind the house?

338
00:19:24,902 --> 00:19:27,488
Yes,There's a path from the garden.

339
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,043
There is an observatory at the top.

340
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:32,496
There are a lot of visitors during the autumn leaves and cherry blossom season.

341
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:34,988
It's cold now, so there aren't many customers.

342
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:37,394
And it's too dark

343
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,722
Shall I send the watchman with you?

344
00:19:41,793 --> 00:19:44,347
Never mind,
I like to go alone

345
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:47,613
He looked so sad.

346
00:19:48,051 --> 00:19:48,410
Hmmm

347
00:19:49,027 --> 00:19:50,308
That's everything he have left.

348
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:50,887
Thanks

349
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:54,105
These are Hamada's?

350
00:19:54,215 --> 00:19:54,785
Yes

351
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:57,363
Dead?

352
00:19:58,387 --> 00:19:59,105
Hamada-san?

353
00:19:59,613 --> 00:20:01,410
Did you notice anything else?

354
00:20:01,957 --> 00:20:03,762
Even if it's a small thing.

355
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:08,215
I can't believe he is dead

356
00:20:08,613 --> 00:20:09,496
I see

357
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:15,012
I've been to Mr. Kikukawa's house, and he's told me most of what I need to know.

358
00:20:15,832 --> 00:20:18,027
It's a tough business you guys are in.

359
00:20:19,605 --> 00:20:23,715
But You're in the business of buying people's grudges.

360
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:27,933
You mean,Possibility of murder?

361
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,129
That's what I thought, given the situation on the ground.

362
00:20:33,527 --> 00:20:37,715
Well,Please let me know if you have any ideas.

363
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,347
Hiroshi!

364
00:20:40,582 --> 00:20:41,191
Hiroshi!

365
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:43,043
Don't be stupid.

366
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:46,199
Mr. Hamada has nothing to do with us.

367
00:20:46,308 --> 00:20:47,285
You don't understand!

368
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:50,324
If I join to Eagles, Hamada-san weren't dead

369
00:20:50,512 --> 00:20:52,387
Mr. Hamada hasn't been ruled a suicide.

370
00:20:52,816 --> 00:20:55,715
The detective said Mr. Hamada may have been murdered.

371
00:20:55,816 --> 00:20:57,019
Mr. Hamada committed suicide.

372
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,285
Mr. Hamada lost the scout battle.
It's my fault.

373
00:20:59,402 --> 00:20:59,871
It's my fault.

374
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:01,058
Hiroshi!

375
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:02,308
Hiroshi!

376
00:21:23,871 --> 00:21:24,519
Hey Let's go!

377
00:21:24,746 --> 00:21:25,457
Here we go!

378
00:21:27,816 --> 00:21:28,676
Oh shit!

379
00:21:32,965 --> 00:21:34,824
Hey! wait for me!

380
00:21:35,332 --> 00:21:37,746
Hi, Are you Kikukawa?

381
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:39,722
Yes...

382
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:41,410
I want to talk with you

383
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:43,488
Do you want to join professional baseball?

384
00:21:43,722 --> 00:21:45,004
I can join professional baseball?

385
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:48,371
You can be a good pitcher if you work hard.

386
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,097
But I am bad.
They made me switch to the outfield.

387
00:21:53,503 --> 00:21:55,659
You failed at the qualifying tournament the other day.

388
00:21:56,488 --> 00:21:58,222
You were a light outfielder , weren't you?

389
00:21:58,418 --> 00:22:00,464
One infield hit and you weren't active.

390
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:01,816
Well...

391
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:03,957
I've looked into everything you've done.

392
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,574
You are 180cm tall

393
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,051
weight is 78kg

394
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,590
You look like you've lost some weight lately.

395
00:22:12,418 --> 00:22:13,574
Let's shake hands

396
00:22:14,957 --> 00:22:16,762
Hold my hand as hard as you can.

397
00:22:17,152 --> 00:22:18,652
More more!
More more!

398
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:20,965
Ok

399
00:22:22,027 --> 00:22:23,574
That's what I thought More more!

400
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,558
You have a power

401
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:27,136
But I can't control the ball.

402
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:31,573
High school is not the place for you to make the most of your talents.

403
00:22:31,621 --> 00:22:33,401
Hey!

404
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:36,066
Come on!

405
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,988
You look like a raging horse right now.

406
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,863
A rampaging horse is hard to control.

407
00:22:49,097 --> 00:22:51,417
But Your sinker is great.

408
00:22:52,128 --> 00:22:54,760
High school kids can't hit that ball.

409
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:58,183
You have your own pitch.

410
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:02,339
When you learn to do that, you'll be a great pitcher.

411
00:23:03,558 --> 00:23:04,206
You think so?

412
00:23:04,371 --> 00:23:05,855
Yes trust me

413
00:23:06,144 --> 00:23:08,605
My instincts are often right.

414
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:14,251
Sakaguchi of the Eagles, Aoshima of the Elephants I first spotted.

415
00:23:16,071 --> 00:23:18,165
But our club has no money

416
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:24,181
We are always the last ones to be able to pay and other club take the players.

417
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,666
We're pathetic.

418
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,322
I don't care about money

419
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,220
Everyone say like you first

420
00:23:31,322 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm not

421
00:23:33,642 --> 00:23:35,845
Good.
I trust you

422
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:38,025
Listen to me

423
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:44,197
Don't tell your father or the baseball coach about what we talked about today.

424
00:23:44,283 --> 00:23:44,760
OK?

425
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,720
Don't swim from today.

426
00:23:48,338 --> 00:23:49,955
It's not good to cool your shoulders.

427
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,783
Yes

428
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:53,532
Good.
Let's shake hand again

429
00:23:54,635 --> 00:23:57,080
Our test has been finished

430
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,291
Did Mr. Hamada really commit suicide?

431
00:24:04,689 --> 00:24:07,619
According to our investigation, yes.

432
00:24:07,806 --> 00:24:12,314
But I'm not comfortable with him dying so easily.

433
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,291
I feel the same

434
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,806
He's not that kind of man.

435
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,916
We started out investigating other deaths, too.

436
00:24:22,072 --> 00:24:23,853
But there's no evidence of that.

437
00:24:25,658 --> 00:24:28,767
Mr. Hamada's time of death was estimated at 7:30 p.m.

438
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,806
An official who knows where Mr. Hamada is staying

439
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,744
You are included,Kashiwagi-san

440
00:24:36,752 --> 00:24:38,752
All of them stayed in the city

441
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:42,188
I also talked to a guest at the Sakai Hotel.

442
00:24:43,025 --> 00:24:44,900
There were no one who went out at that time

443
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:50,220
Mr. Hamada was found in a kimono with wide sleeves.

444
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:54,041
He wasn't attacked by a street thief.

445
00:24:55,525 --> 00:24:57,181
So we ruled it a suicide.

446
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:00,619
But He was drunk at that night

447
00:25:01,478 --> 00:25:03,814
Can you guess that he accidentally fell off the cliff?

448
00:25:04,681 --> 00:25:05,986
About that point

449
00:25:06,744 --> 00:25:09,025
You will see if you go there

450
00:25:10,196 --> 00:25:10,938
Like this

451
00:25:11,267 --> 00:25:15,783
There are about 5 meters from the observatory to the cliff.

452
00:25:17,228 --> 00:25:19,853
He can't accidentally fall.

453
00:25:20,549 --> 00:25:22,635
According to my assistant

454
00:25:23,385 --> 00:25:25,994
Kikukawa called him that night to refuse to join the team.

455
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:29,111
Hamada got shocked

456
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,728
He stood on a dark mountaintop.

457
00:25:34,103 --> 00:25:37,939
He might have thought about dying suddenly.

458
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,463
Speaking of him, Recently he was unlucky

459
00:26:00,103 --> 00:26:00,361
One more!

460
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,064
Yes!

461
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:06,994
Hi

462
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:08,439
How is him?

463
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,783
He is ok

464
00:26:11,329 --> 00:26:12,626
How's his shoulder?

465
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,658
You'll know if you see his throwing

466
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:16,197
You always don't tell me

467
00:26:16,275 --> 00:26:18,619
I'll teach you if he is a test student without a contract fee.

468
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,892
Hey! Kashi

469
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:22,588
Yes

470
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,674
You pitch from the home base

471
00:26:26,861 --> 00:26:28,540
I want to see your shoulder

472
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:29,736
Yes

473
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,088
Hey, stop practice!

474
00:26:34,658 --> 00:26:35,970
Let me throw a ball

475
00:26:46,611 --> 00:26:49,564
He's the holder of the 108-meter long throw record.

476
00:26:50,033 --> 00:26:50,845
108m?

477
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:54,041
You measure it with a measuring tape in your spare time.

478
00:26:54,619 --> 00:26:55,283
You think so?

479
00:27:06,821 --> 00:27:08,829
Are you saying that I'm the reason why the Eagles lost the championship?

480
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:14,712
I also missed out on the stolen base title.

481
00:27:15,048 --> 00:27:16,798
My batting average has dropped to 230.

482
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:21,212
But everyone has their slumps.

483
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:25,282
I know you understand this

484
00:27:27,204 --> 00:27:29,173
Why am I being traded?

485
00:27:29,415 --> 00:27:32,696
Wait,kashi,
I understand how you feel

486
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:36,212
I think we should move on while there are still teams to pick up.

487
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,618
Even if you stay, next season is going to be tough.

488
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,876
I understand your situation, so I've asked the team to trade you.

489
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,564
Do not misunderstand me

490
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:53,383
I have a hard time seeing you being overtaken by the younger generation.

491
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,845
Can you transfer to Eagles?

492
00:27:56,454 --> 00:27:58,759
Good luck in your new team

493
00:27:59,111 --> 00:27:59,720
OK?

494
00:28:03,423 --> 00:28:04,103
One more

495
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:18,517
Hamada-san has ended up in such a small box.

496
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,509
What time should I take the train home?

497
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,954
Well...from now....

498
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:29,650
I can catch the train at 1:30 bound for Shiga

499
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,142
I can arrive at Tokyo in day time

500
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:35,353
Is that OK with you,Kashiwagi?

501
00:28:36,579 --> 00:28:37,126
Yes

502
00:28:37,321 --> 00:28:38,759
So Please get ready

503
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,321
Well..I am...

504
00:28:40,392 --> 00:28:41,118
What?

505
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:45,696
I'm sorry but you can go first

506
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,493
I have sometime to do here

507
00:28:50,383 --> 00:28:50,891
To where?

508
00:28:52,228 --> 00:28:53,970
We can go with you

509
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,111
Right,Kashiwagi?

510
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:55,907
Sure

511
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,118
No...Don't worry

512
00:29:00,181 --> 00:29:01,696
I'll go by myself

513
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,321
The place where Hamada died is Okuyamada Onsen, right?

514
00:29:06,571 --> 00:29:07,025
Yes

515
00:29:07,181 --> 00:29:09,462
We can go with you if you want to go there

516
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:12,126
No..it's not

517
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,462
My father's friend is here

518
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:17,017
I didn't know that Hamada's friend is here

519
00:29:17,704 --> 00:29:18,157
Yes

520
00:29:18,267 --> 00:29:20,071
So We will go back to Tokyo first

521
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:20,923
OK?

522
00:29:22,282 --> 00:29:23,110
I see

523
00:29:23,353 --> 00:29:26,017
Then we can go back first

524
00:29:26,814 --> 00:29:28,251
I've got a lot to prepare for.

525
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:29,336
Yes

526
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,415
I'm sorry

527
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:32,946
I'm sorry for being so selfish.

528
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,275
Never mind

529
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,016
I understand your situation

530
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,415
Let's get ready

531
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:41,439
Thank you very much

532
00:29:42,642 --> 00:29:43,845
Thank you very much

533
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:49,892
You know what...

534
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:50,650
What?

535
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:52,595
I will be here

536
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:53,845
I'm curious about something.

537
00:29:54,212 --> 00:29:54,993
I see

538
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,978
You can go by yourself

539
00:29:58,392 --> 00:29:59,321
I don't care

540
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:03,298
I see.
I'm curious about leaving her alone too

541
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:06,048
Then. I'll leave it to you

542
00:30:06,157 --> 00:30:06,540
Sure

543
00:30:09,337 --> 00:30:09,837
See you

544
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:11,126
Hello?

545
00:30:12,173 --> 00:30:13,775
Oh, Kashiwagi-san

546
00:30:14,907 --> 00:30:16,165
Eh?..Hmmm

547
00:30:16,634 --> 00:30:19,103
Mr. Hamada's daughter just left.

548
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:24,478
Yes,She was looking for a Ichinomiya watchmaker.

549
00:30:25,462 --> 00:30:26,665
Ichinomiya

550
00:30:27,634 --> 00:30:28,462
Hello?

551
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:30,001
Hello?

552
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,493
Why he hang up the phone...

553
00:30:39,126 --> 00:30:40,626
Hello, Can I ask you something?

554
00:30:41,196 --> 00:30:44,275
Welcome, men's watches are there

555
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:48,946
No no...Didn't a young woman come in here a little while ago now?

556
00:30:49,587 --> 00:30:52,134
She had her head trimmed, and she was wearing a brown coat.

557
00:30:52,845 --> 00:30:54,243
Oh,Hamada-san

558
00:30:54,782 --> 00:30:56,227
Do you know her?

559
00:30:56,532 --> 00:30:58,673
No, She was first visiting us

560
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:00,368
I see..but...

561
00:31:00,618 --> 00:31:04,767
She's here about a watch her father bought.

562
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:05,329
I see

563
00:31:05,712 --> 00:31:07,079
Are you a police?

564
00:31:07,361 --> 00:31:10,134
No no, I'm just looking for her

565
00:31:10,173 --> 00:31:12,587
Are you a private detective?

566
00:31:13,314 --> 00:31:15,532
Yes..kind of

567
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:17,946
I see, I understand

568
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,079
I was also surprised to see yesterday's evening paper.

569
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:29,165
The day before he died, he bought a 65,000 yen woman watch from this store.

570
00:31:29,462 --> 00:31:30,587
A woman watch?

571
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:31,681
Yes

572
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:37,009
He said it would suit a city girl

573
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,797
I gave him the same type as this one.

574
00:31:41,821 --> 00:31:44,236
The size fits Mr. Hamada's daughter.

575
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:45,314
I see

576
00:32:11,564 --> 00:32:13,165
I wanted to come here

577
00:32:14,939 --> 00:32:16,782
But You are too cold

578
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:20,157
Why you didn't tell me you come here ?

579
00:32:22,868 --> 00:32:24,220
You checked the watch store

580
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,650
You came to this lonely place alone.

581
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:29,064
What the hell?

582
00:32:30,431 --> 00:32:32,595
I'm sorry I hide something

583
00:32:34,696 --> 00:32:38,142
But I didn't want people to know my father's secret.

584
00:32:39,361 --> 00:32:39,892
His secret?

585
00:32:40,775 --> 00:32:42,212
Did he have a secret?

586
00:33:02,259 --> 00:33:03,838
This was in his wallet

587
00:33:04,173 --> 00:33:04,689
Um

588
00:33:05,869 --> 00:33:07,853
He didn't buy it for me

589
00:33:09,158 --> 00:33:12,986
I couldn't find that watch in his belongings.

590
00:33:15,728 --> 00:33:19,447
The day before he died, he came to Nagano and bought that watch.

591
00:33:20,877 --> 00:33:25,681
He gave the watch to the woman that evening.

592
00:33:26,002 --> 00:33:27,494
I don't believe his has girlfriend

593
00:33:27,627 --> 00:33:30,142
Speaking of it,I have an idea.

594
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:35,447
He hadn't been home for a month and a half since the end of summer.

595
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:41,986
He's sometime been home for work but

596
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:46,947
It was the first time he'd gone a month and a half without coming home.

597
00:33:48,908 --> 00:33:49,830
And...

598
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:54,478
He's cut the living expenses he gives to the house in half.

599
00:33:55,838 --> 00:33:56,572
Hmmm

600
00:33:57,158 --> 00:33:58,603
I didn't know this

601
00:34:00,431 --> 00:34:03,400
I scolded my father about the money.

602
00:34:04,845 --> 00:34:08,275
It was the same the morning before my father died.

603
00:34:17,470 --> 00:34:19,103
I'm leaving

604
00:34:20,634 --> 00:34:21,892
When you will go back?

605
00:34:21,939 --> 00:34:23,728
I'll go back soon

606
00:34:26,291 --> 00:34:27,322
This is my salary

607
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:32,588
Not much this month, either.

608
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,447
What do you spend for?

609
00:34:36,338 --> 00:34:38,556
I was surprised to see your savings book.

610
00:34:39,275 --> 00:34:40,463
It's been cut in half.

611
00:34:40,752 --> 00:34:43,963
I need money for my work

612
00:34:44,197 --> 00:34:46,666
You can ask your company for the money

613
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:49,899
Our company has no money, you know?

614
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:52,462
Please be patient

615
00:34:52,588 --> 00:34:56,103
When this job is done, I'll even make it easy for you.

616
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:00,470
I finally understand how my mother feel who dead before

617
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,205
She didn't complain.

618
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,173
Because she gave up about you

619
00:35:06,752 --> 00:35:08,658
I'm not like my mother

620
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:13,244
It's hard to take care of you.

621
00:35:13,923 --> 00:35:14,775
Hmm...

622
00:35:15,783 --> 00:35:18,166
So you should go to marry

623
00:35:18,556 --> 00:35:22,431
If you marry, I'll remarry too.

624
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,369
There is no woman who wants to marry you

625
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:28,189
You're not home for half the year.

626
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,033
I have potential.

627
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,689
Oh, you know someone?

628
00:35:33,877 --> 00:35:36,408
What? I'm starting to look for her

629
00:35:38,627 --> 00:35:41,806
I'm sure he has girlfriend

630
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,931
Then why did he kill himself?

631
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,416
I doubt too

632
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,931
I don't think he killed himself.

633
00:35:51,244 --> 00:35:54,814
But I didn't tell the police because I didn't know for sure.

634
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:03,002
If I know he had girlfriend for sure...

635
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:06,259
His honor will be damaged.

636
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:08,681
Then you come here alone?

637
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:11,673
I don't want anyone to know this

638
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:13,720
Sorry

639
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:16,228
Never mind

640
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,580
But Shizue

641
00:36:19,908 --> 00:36:22,877
You are just girl, so no choice

642
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,814
If anything happens to you, you're in trouble.

643
00:36:28,431 --> 00:36:30,080
Can you leave it to me if you don't mind?

644
00:36:32,306 --> 00:36:34,822
Mr.Hamada took care of me very well

645
00:36:36,048 --> 00:36:40,478
But in opposition to returning that favor to him, the Kikukawa case...

646
00:36:41,548 --> 00:36:44,603
I've put him in a difficult position.

647
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,236
I don't think that was the direct cause.

648
00:36:49,728 --> 00:36:51,454
But I'm having a hard time if I think about it

649
00:36:53,072 --> 00:36:58,697
So I want to handle about Hamada's case

650
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:01,790
If you don't mind

651
00:37:03,744 --> 00:37:05,275
I feel thanks to you

652
00:37:06,642 --> 00:37:07,338
But

653
00:37:10,634 --> 00:37:12,002
I know what you want to say

654
00:37:14,564 --> 00:37:17,361
I'm calling off my engagement to you.

655
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,423
Let's both pretend this never happened.

656
00:37:21,384 --> 00:37:25,572
From now on, please associate with us as the bereaved family of the dead Mr. Hamada.

657
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,142
Cold wind

658
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,548
I need to go Tokyo by the end of today

659
00:37:40,681 --> 00:37:41,759
Ok let's go

660
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:58,963
That's true.
Every school now has a physical fitness test at the beginning of each semester.

661
00:37:59,853 --> 00:38:01,783
For boys, 100m...

662
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,330
Long jump, pull-ups, ball throw etc

663
00:38:05,986 --> 00:38:08,705
The grades are differentiated.

664
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:11,267
So I have an idea

665
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,978
Why don't we go through those records and mark the best students?

666
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,580
What happen if he don't know baseball?

667
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:20,494
That's risky, and there are many materials

668
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:23,259
That's a lot of time to waste.

669
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:25,650
I don't think so,
Kashi's idea is good

670
00:38:26,384 --> 00:38:27,877
We had a blind spot.

671
00:38:28,775 --> 00:38:32,642
No matter how good you are, if they don't play baseball, they'll never catch our attention.

672
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,806
A person who has the makings of a baseball player and plays other sports.

673
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,150
People who do not play sports

674
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:44,173
I think there are many such hidden gems.

675
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:47,048
OK, let's do this!

676
00:38:48,009 --> 00:38:48,955
Hey,Kashi

677
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,197
For starters, let's start with your area of responsibility.

678
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:53,946
Yes

679
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,509
It's a deal.

680
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:59,142
Have them go to each district to report.
Let's break up.

681
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:06,994
Hey,Kashi

682
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:07,728
Yes

683
00:39:08,353 --> 00:39:09,704
You finally get motivated

684
00:39:09,736 --> 00:39:10,408
No way

685
00:39:10,736 --> 00:39:12,080
That's good

686
00:39:13,423 --> 00:39:16,213
You have a dream of an athletic life in your head.

687
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,298
Hamada get rid of  it for you

688
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:20,056
Anyway good luck

689
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:20,705
Yes

690
00:39:20,805 --> 00:39:22,719
There is a call for you

691
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:23,658
Thank you

692
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:25,642
Hello? this is Kashiwagi speaking

693
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,861
Oh, Mr.Kikukawa

694
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:30,080
How is it going?

695
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:33,353
What? Kiyoshi was??

696
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:34,900
What's wrong?

697
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,892
He didn't go back home since yesterday

698
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:37,494
What?

699
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:38,322
Hello?

700
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:41,540
Isn't Hiroshi supposed to be at the camp soon?

701
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,603
Please explain me in detail

702
00:39:44,853 --> 00:39:47,713
Yes, he left home yesterday morning, then he is missing

703
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,822
Yes, I tried to look for him, but...

704
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,931
I couldn't find him...yes..

705
00:39:55,111 --> 00:39:57,088
Ok I will contact them

706
00:39:57,113 --> 00:39:58,111
Yes

707
00:39:58,861 --> 00:40:00,502
He is not in Yoshida's camp

708
00:40:01,134 --> 00:40:02,298
He is stupid

709
00:40:03,416 --> 00:40:05,580
Don't worry, he is till young

710
00:40:06,189 --> 00:40:07,291
He went for play

711
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,947
But

712
00:40:09,306 --> 00:40:10,603
Don't get too nervous.

713
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:14,103
Well...They've already received the contract money.

714
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:15,259
Yes

715
00:40:17,955 --> 00:40:18,548
Hello?

716
00:40:18,752 --> 00:40:19,330
From Kikukawa?

717
00:40:19,564 --> 00:40:21,142
Hello? this is Kashiwagi speaking

718
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,767
Oh..Shizue...

719
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,267
I'm busy now

720
00:40:28,408 --> 00:40:29,369
X-ray photo?

721
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:30,939
Who's?

722
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:32,736
Yes

723
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,744
It was the end of last month.

724
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:38,752
Mr.Hamada sent this photo to me

725
00:40:39,736 --> 00:40:40,728
With letter

726
00:40:44,853 --> 00:40:45,822
I found it

727
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,063
Here it is

728
00:40:49,736 --> 00:40:52,845
It says to find out more about the enclosed photos.

729
00:40:53,783 --> 00:40:56,533
I can't report it because he's dead.

730
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:59,533
I don't need to have it.

731
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:01,244
So what is this photo?

732
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:02,775
Shall I explain to you?

733
00:41:02,861 --> 00:41:03,291
Yes

734
00:41:09,783 --> 00:41:11,611
This is the bone in his arm.

735
00:41:12,267 --> 00:41:15,080
Look.
He's got a crack in his elbow joint.

736
00:41:15,775 --> 00:41:17,955
This single photo does not show the detailed condition.

737
00:41:18,782 --> 00:41:20,470
It appears to be a complex fracture.

738
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:25,111
It's a good picture because it was taken with an excellent x-ray machine.

739
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:28,509
Our surgeon was impressed.

740
00:41:31,439 --> 00:41:31,955
Um

741
00:41:33,822 --> 00:41:34,416
What?

742
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:36,408
I realized now

743
00:41:37,197 --> 00:41:38,908
He has long arm

744
00:41:39,353 --> 00:41:40,533
And he is tall

745
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,009
Do you know which arm?

746
00:41:44,572 --> 00:41:45,259
Left arm

747
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:48,127
It may be difficult for the uninitiated to understand.

748
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:56,955
It depends on the individual.
But he is over 180cm

749
00:41:58,009 --> 00:42:01,127
Calculated from the standard index of height for this bony part of the body.

750
00:42:01,853 --> 00:42:02,791
It would be...

751
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:28,626
Sorry for making you trouble

752
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,962
Then see you

753
00:42:30,322 --> 00:42:33,197
Hello, do you know where is Hiroshi?

754
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:34,931
Oh long time no see

755
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:38,447
I've just called to the baseball club office

756
00:42:38,752 --> 00:42:42,017
We are sorry for making you trouble

757
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,158
How is Hiroshi doing?

758
00:42:44,283 --> 00:42:48,033
Yes, He was brought back safely by the teacher.

759
00:42:48,916 --> 00:42:50,158
Is he back?

760
00:42:50,805 --> 00:42:51,634
Excuse me

761
00:42:57,603 --> 00:42:58,330
Stand up!

762
00:42:59,111 --> 00:42:59,658
Now

763
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:02,861
Do you feel pain?

764
00:43:03,533 --> 00:43:04,830
What's wrong with you?

765
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:06,236
Do the pitching motion.

766
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:09,408
Do it!

767
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:14,447
Faster.

768
00:43:14,611 --> 00:43:16,017
Throw as if you were on the mound.

769
00:43:19,431 --> 00:43:20,861
What's wrong with you,Kashiwagi-san?

770
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:21,876
What the hell are you doing?

771
00:43:21,931 --> 00:43:22,517
Once again

772
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:41,947
I thought you were out of your mind.

773
00:43:42,783 --> 00:43:44,712
You did it as soon as you walked in the house.

774
00:43:45,837 --> 00:43:46,517
I was sorry

775
00:43:47,712 --> 00:43:48,134
Let's drink

776
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,002
Well...I am...

777
00:43:51,228 --> 00:43:54,080
I was worried when I saw those X-rays.

778
00:43:54,322 --> 00:43:55,486
Anyway I've relieved

779
00:43:58,134 --> 00:44:00,462
Where did you find Kikukawa?

780
00:44:01,212 --> 00:44:03,306
Yes..I happened to see him

781
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:06,275
Actually

782
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:11,744
We have recently appointed a new English teacher at our school

783
00:44:12,767 --> 00:44:15,791
Today we're going to celebrate his transfer.

784
00:44:17,962 --> 00:44:20,666
The man coming from the other side is Kikukawa, isn't it?

785
00:44:25,384 --> 00:44:26,283
Stop here,Please

786
00:44:28,447 --> 00:44:29,455
Kikukawa-kun!

787
00:44:31,321 --> 00:44:32,016
teacher!

788
00:44:35,259 --> 00:44:37,267
Your father worry about you, he called me many times

789
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,400
You are bad

790
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:39,572
I'm sorry

791
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:41,259
What's wrong with you?

792
00:44:41,563 --> 00:44:43,821
I wanted to see where Hamada-san died.

793
00:44:46,783 --> 00:44:48,634
I stayed a room where Hamada-san stayed

794
00:44:49,064 --> 00:44:50,423
And I was thinking of him

795
00:44:51,009 --> 00:44:54,369
I thought I'd give back the money the Boobies gave me and join the Eagles.

796
00:44:55,462 --> 00:44:59,634
But I knew that would hurt Kashiwagi-san.

797
00:45:00,736 --> 00:45:01,658
I'm not lost anymore.

798
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:04,759
I thought about it at the spa and got motivated.

799
00:45:06,251 --> 00:45:06,861
I see

800
00:45:07,658 --> 00:45:09,376
I'm sorry to make you worry

801
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:10,884
Never mind

802
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,267
By the way, you go home on foot

803
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:18,541
I spent all my money on hotel bills. So I decided to walk home.

804
00:45:20,228 --> 00:45:22,478
You are stupid.
You could call your home

805
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:23,931
My father is noisy

806
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:26,048
Ok I will send you home

807
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:27,212
Wait a min

808
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:34,243
Something tells me,Kikukawa seems to me very cute

809
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:36,697
I felt bad about giving him back to home alone.

810
00:45:38,650 --> 00:45:40,244
I felt bad about giving him back to home alone.

811
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:43,041
I canceled my buddy's transfer celebration and went home with him.

812
00:45:43,291 --> 00:45:44,361
I see

813
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:47,900
Please take care of Kikukawa well,Kashiwagi-san

814
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:49,775
Of course

815
00:45:51,126 --> 00:45:54,392
Therefore...Whose X-rays are those?

816
00:45:56,283 --> 00:45:56,900
You know what

817
00:45:57,986 --> 00:45:58,376
Ha

818
00:46:01,942 --> 00:46:08,707
Do you know if Mr. Hamada marked anyone other than Kikukawa?

819
00:46:09,513 --> 00:46:12,747
Well.....but in my school...

820
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,309
There is anyone other than Kikukawa

821
00:46:18,903 --> 00:46:20,044
I see

822
00:46:30,957 --> 00:46:31,887
Oh

823
00:46:32,043 --> 00:46:33,168
Welcome

824
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,606
There's a scary man here to see you.

825
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:36,372
Eh?

826
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:41,700
Oh!

827
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:42,293
Ah

828
00:46:43,754 --> 00:46:45,676
It's been a long time

829
00:46:45,701 --> 00:46:48,942
You're starting to sound like a full-fledged Scout.

830
00:46:49,379 --> 00:46:50,153
Only looking?

831
00:46:51,059 --> 00:46:54,676
Everyone said that you were not yet good enough.

832
00:46:55,153 --> 00:46:56,387
You should work hard

833
00:46:56,645 --> 00:46:58,762
It's sad to hear Mr. Hamada say that.

834
00:46:58,839 --> 00:46:59,707
Of course

835
00:46:59,747 --> 00:47:01,004
Give him a high ball

836
00:47:01,918 --> 00:47:04,254
How about Kikukawa's work?

837
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,817
Our Eagles will get him.

838
00:47:07,372 --> 00:47:09,590
The game's not over yet.

839
00:47:11,832 --> 00:47:14,168
You're a big talker.

840
00:47:17,106 --> 00:47:18,254
You know what,Kashi

841
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:20,879
Do you still remember, 108m?

842
00:47:21,879 --> 00:47:22,848
108m?

843
00:47:23,168 --> 00:47:23,957
Yes

844
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:27,653
That was the first time I took you to the Eagles' field.

845
00:47:28,473 --> 00:47:31,575
I was surprised too, inwardly.

846
00:47:31,926 --> 00:47:35,192
You threw a ball that disappeared into the outfield.

847
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:39,926
I'm moved to remember it.

848
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:42,559
It was 108m

849
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:45,801
What happened about the 108m?

850
00:47:46,411 --> 00:47:47,090
Nothing

851
00:47:57,348 --> 00:47:58,497
108m?

852
00:47:59,129 --> 00:48:00,973
What? 108m?

853
00:48:01,489 --> 00:48:04,465
Yes,It's a record for the longest throw of a ball.

854
00:48:05,137 --> 00:48:08,051
Did any of them set a record of 108m?

855
00:48:08,551 --> 00:48:11,731
Well...speaking of 108m...

856
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,989
I should check it carefully

857
00:48:16,262 --> 00:48:20,161
Have you ever had the same scout as me before?

858
00:48:20,942 --> 00:48:22,168
Well...

859
00:48:22,231 --> 00:48:26,114
He's a big guy with big sunglasses named Shinichi Hamada.

860
00:48:26,364 --> 00:48:28,653
You are the first person

861
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:30,364
Yes

862
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,317
I see

863
00:48:31,504 --> 00:48:32,692
the county's general affairs division.

864
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:33,911
Well

865
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:34,403
Yes

866
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:36,692
Do you want to see the result?

867
00:48:36,981 --> 00:48:37,989
Yes please

868
00:48:38,442 --> 00:48:40,200
So please come this way

869
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:46,707
I can show you, but it will take time to check it

870
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:47,457
Yes

871
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,340
Please feel free to take a look at it

872
00:48:57,411 --> 00:48:58,239
Did you find?

873
00:48:58,536 --> 00:48:59,559
Hmmm

874
00:49:01,098 --> 00:49:01,934
You must be tired

875
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,825
But I won't give up

876
00:49:04,176 --> 00:49:05,153
I will come here again tomorrow

877
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:06,309
Please

878
00:49:07,629 --> 00:49:08,098
See you

879
00:49:08,207 --> 00:49:08,973
Thank you

880
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:52,098
Kashiwagi-san

881
00:49:53,496 --> 00:49:54,996
Oh you

882
00:49:56,207 --> 00:49:58,207
I just watched the Blue Sox camp.

883
00:49:58,497 --> 00:49:59,981
It's boring if I go home directly

884
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:02,075
I want to celebrate you

885
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:03,637
Oh thanks

886
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,012
Wanna have a drink?

887
00:50:05,387 --> 00:50:06,543
I'm tired,Sorry

888
00:50:06,582 --> 00:50:09,449
I know a good place to get rid of it.
Get in the car!

889
00:50:09,684 --> 00:50:11,200
You should accompany with me sometime

890
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:19,465
You know what

891
00:50:19,653 --> 00:50:20,340
One more bar

892
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,223
No thanks.
I need to wake up early

893
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,700
It' ok,
You are so cold

894
00:50:23,725 --> 00:50:24,318
Come on come on

895
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:27,762
Welcome

896
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:33,247
Hatano-san

897
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:36,090
Oh you

898
00:50:37,247 --> 00:50:38,942
We met in an unusual way, didn't we?

899
00:50:39,254 --> 00:50:41,184
I was invited by the PTA.

900
00:50:41,903 --> 00:50:44,051
It wasn't much fun, so I got out.

901
00:50:44,895 --> 00:50:48,043
I see. I want to get out too

902
00:50:48,068 --> 00:50:49,256
What the hell you are talking about?

903
00:50:49,281 --> 00:50:49,723
Coat!

904
00:50:49,748 --> 00:50:50,082
Yes

905
00:50:50,879 --> 00:50:51,817
Then see you

906
00:51:01,395 --> 00:51:02,364
Hey,Kashiwagi-san

907
00:51:03,114 --> 00:51:06,606
Hamada-san is dead. But neither suicide nor accidental death.

908
00:51:07,004 --> 00:51:08,840
You thought someone killed him,right?

909
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,098
So you are searching it

910
00:51:12,145 --> 00:51:13,707
This is my guess

911
00:51:14,286 --> 00:51:15,465
Hey,Kashiwagi-san

912
00:51:15,817 --> 00:51:18,543
We all have our own networks of information.

913
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:21,840
We're both looking into Mr. Hamada's murder.

914
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,442
So we can exchange the information

915
00:51:27,442 --> 00:51:29,270
I don't know what is your meaning

916
00:51:29,348 --> 00:51:30,434
Why do you pretend not to know?

917
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:32,051
Shall I surprise you?

918
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:34,786
I wonder Mr. Hamada had girlfriend

919
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:37,184
How did you know?

920
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:38,723
Did you meet her?

921
00:51:39,512 --> 00:51:40,902
You got your answer.

922
00:51:43,372 --> 00:51:45,645
Hey, can you tell me the detail?

923
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:49,278
In return, I'll give you some good information.

924
00:51:50,012 --> 00:51:51,575
There's a good hitter.

925
00:51:51,856 --> 00:51:53,793
Oh, you can tell first

926
00:51:54,575 --> 00:51:57,434
Kashiwagi-san,That's not fair

927
00:51:58,895 --> 00:52:00,520
Hey, let's dance

928
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,676
You guys talks all the time

929
00:52:03,739 --> 00:52:04,856
There is no woman here

930
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:07,051
You are bad

931
00:52:07,637 --> 00:52:09,191
You invited me here

932
00:52:09,301 --> 00:52:10,770
You are mean

933
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,293
I'm glad you hate me

934
00:52:15,543 --> 00:52:17,684
Hey, bring that girl

935
00:52:17,715 --> 00:52:18,317
Who?

936
00:52:18,342 --> 00:52:20,215
That girl who wear Kimono

937
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:23,324
No good, she is not for you

938
00:52:23,504 --> 00:52:24,020
Right

939
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:26,973
That's true.
She is calm not like me

940
00:52:27,036 --> 00:52:29,207
I like it.
What's her name?

941
00:52:29,512 --> 00:52:30,293
Yukari

942
00:52:32,387 --> 00:52:32,864
Hey

943
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:37,207
We should go

944
00:52:40,879 --> 00:52:42,270
She's a woman of clarity.

945
00:52:45,098 --> 00:52:46,239
Welcome

946
00:52:46,457 --> 00:52:47,809
Ah, take your seat

947
00:52:48,442 --> 00:52:49,418
This is Kashiwagi-san

948
00:52:49,989 --> 00:52:50,731
Good man,right?

949
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,825
I'm just dirty man

950
00:52:53,122 --> 00:52:54,379
You are funny

951
00:52:54,411 --> 00:52:54,957
Enjoy drinking

952
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:01,286
Oh Yukari is there

953
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:02,286
What?

954
00:53:06,114 --> 00:53:07,395
Thanks for support me

955
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:08,215
I don't need anymore?

956
00:53:08,293 --> 00:53:11,207
Um,Because if you stay too long, you'll get worse.

957
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:14,153
Ah,take your seat

958
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:16,309
What are you talking about?

959
00:53:16,348 --> 00:53:17,192
That's our secret

960
00:53:17,316 --> 00:53:17,730
Right?

961
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:21,005
Can I guess it?
You're talking about a pawn shop, right?

962
00:53:21,395 --> 00:53:23,528
in and out of pawn

963
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:24,520
You have a nice watch

964
00:53:25,442 --> 00:53:26,356
cheap one, right?

965
00:53:26,434 --> 00:53:27,302
No way

966
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:29,614
It's a famous brand, right?

967
00:53:29,856 --> 00:53:31,481
She was able to get it at the asking price.

968
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:32,786
Let me see

969
00:53:35,161 --> 00:53:36,036
Someone gave you?

970
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:38,067
Yes

971
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:39,934
Let's dance together

972
00:53:40,395 --> 00:53:40,903
Yes

973
00:53:44,317 --> 00:53:46,684
He made a good move.

974
00:53:46,709 --> 00:53:48,927
Never mind.
We'll be friends, too.

975
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:51,505
Have you been working here long?

976
00:53:51,591 --> 00:53:52,755
Not long

977
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:53,888
Were you here around this summer?

978
00:53:54,036 --> 00:53:55,184
Why you ask me?

979
00:53:55,403 --> 00:53:58,020
My senior brought me here before

980
00:53:58,045 --> 00:54:00,083
I see.
I can't remember

981
00:54:00,716 --> 00:54:05,231
I think my senior gave you that watch

982
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,841
Shall I tell you his name?

983
00:54:12,286 --> 00:54:13,020
Please

984
00:54:14,052 --> 00:54:15,591
The deceased Mr. Hamada

985
00:54:27,919 --> 00:54:29,778
I didn't mean I surprise you

986
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:35,106
I had seen that watch before.

987
00:54:37,059 --> 00:54:39,278
I didn't know you are the woman...

988
00:54:41,942 --> 00:54:43,325
What do you want to know?

989
00:54:43,653 --> 00:54:46,872
I want to know everything about Hamada

990
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:52,505
I want to know the truth about Mr. Hamada's sudden death.

991
00:54:53,098 --> 00:54:56,630
So I have been looking for the woman who concern about Hamada

992
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,575
Can you tell me?

993
00:55:04,582 --> 00:55:05,520
Hamada and you...

994
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:08,457
Mr.Hamada was my guest for sure

995
00:55:09,692 --> 00:55:12,880
He sometime visited us, and called me

996
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,294
That's all

997
00:55:14,481 --> 00:55:17,364
He gave you a $65,000 watch as a gift.

998
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,333
Can you tell me the truth?

999
00:55:23,184 --> 00:55:24,864
Did you really like Hamada?

1000
00:55:26,606 --> 00:55:27,192
Well...

1001
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:34,825
We can talk about it at somewhere in the day time

1002
00:55:36,778 --> 00:55:38,505
Thanks.
Up to you

1003
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:42,059
So please come to my apartment tomorrow

1004
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:45,051
Around noon, it calls Takara apartment

1005
00:55:45,981 --> 00:55:49,013
You will know easily if you ask the police box at overhead bridge

1006
00:55:49,411 --> 00:55:51,598
Takara apartment,right,
I'm sure I will see you

1007
00:55:57,747 --> 00:55:59,622
There is a guest for you

1008
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:00,372
Who?

1009
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:02,263
I won't tell you

1010
00:56:08,177 --> 00:56:09,848
Oh you

1011
00:56:10,427 --> 00:56:11,856
Am I bad?

1012
00:56:12,098 --> 00:56:12,973
Welcome

1013
00:56:14,989 --> 00:56:16,005
Why you are here?

1014
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,645
I stopped by on my way to deliver something to my teacher, Yamada

1015
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:21,200
Who is teacher, Yamada?

1016
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:24,083
You don't know anything other than baseball

1017
00:56:24,692 --> 00:56:25,848
He is a famous painter

1018
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,614
A painting in my gallery was sold.

1019
00:56:30,403 --> 00:56:32,372
I see.
That's good

1020
00:56:32,786 --> 00:56:33,575
There is a good news

1021
00:56:34,067 --> 00:56:34,684
What?

1022
00:56:34,848 --> 00:56:37,091
I found the owner of that watch.

1023
00:56:37,630 --> 00:56:38,184
Eh?

1024
00:56:39,598 --> 00:56:43,661
It was happening.
At the bar in Gundo-cho

1025
00:56:44,278 --> 00:56:44,848
I see

1026
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:49,833
So what kind of woman?

1027
00:56:50,294 --> 00:56:51,098
Hmmm

1028
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,677
She has beautiful eyes.
I can say She is a beautiful woman

1029
00:56:58,442 --> 00:57:01,177
I will see her tomorrow and talk about Hamada

1030
00:57:02,841 --> 00:57:03,989
He has a girlfriend as I thought

1031
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:06,645
I feel relieved

1032
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:09,677
I feel disappointed

1033
00:57:11,091 --> 00:57:11,802
Why?

1034
00:57:12,294 --> 00:57:15,770
I'd always hoped my father would never have a woman.

1035
00:57:18,263 --> 00:57:19,231
Is that so?

1036
00:57:19,341 --> 00:57:21,091
You don't understand how woman feel

1037
00:57:23,825 --> 00:57:25,036
It might be so

1038
00:57:42,145 --> 00:57:44,864
I haven't read the letter you gave me

1039
00:57:45,669 --> 00:57:46,192
What should I do?

1040
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:49,403
I won't answer the hard questions.

1041
00:57:50,864 --> 00:57:52,692
Is this a taboo subject?

1042
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,114
I will cancel the question

1043
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,348
Hi,Miss, your room is ready

1044
00:58:00,864 --> 00:58:01,927
Thank you

1045
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,739
Then, I will go with you tomorrow

1046
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:39,707
She has moved?

1047
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:40,817
When was it?

1048
00:58:41,286 --> 00:58:42,411
This early morning

1049
00:58:42,856 --> 00:58:43,684
To where?

1050
00:58:44,052 --> 00:58:45,638
I didn't ask her

1051
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:54,382
Well...Did she often have men in her room who were about forty-five or six years old?

1052
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,648
Well... I didn't see her guest much

1053
00:58:58,531 --> 00:59:03,062
Oh yeah,The man with the sunglasses sometimes came.

1054
00:59:08,344 --> 00:59:09,633
Thank you very much

1055
00:59:09,766 --> 00:59:10,359
Not at all

1056
00:59:10,656 --> 00:59:11,539
Let's go

1057
00:59:18,906 --> 00:59:21,664
Kashiwagi-san, You were terrible last night

1058
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:22,797
How did you know we are here?

1059
00:59:23,961 --> 00:59:24,891
My guess

1060
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:28,031
You were dancing with that woman and you disappeared.

1061
00:59:28,641 --> 00:59:30,820
I heard about it later from a woman named Kyoko.

1062
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:33,930
I see. but you are too late

1063
00:59:34,187 --> 00:59:34,578
What?

1064
00:59:35,062 --> 00:59:37,719
Well..Take your time. Take a look around the empty room.

1065
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:52,874
The train is approaching for Ueno at platform 2

1066
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,797
We'll start all over again.

1067
00:59:57,828 --> 00:59:59,687
Can you leave her alone?

1068
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:01,602
Why?

1069
01:00:03,508 --> 01:00:06,992
Something tells me, That woman Yukari loved my father very much

1070
01:00:08,641 --> 01:00:11,031
She didn't want to be asked about my father.

1071
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:12,867
So she disappeared

1072
01:00:13,562 --> 01:00:16,210
But She's the only lead I have.

1073
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:19,312
I will try to find her

1074
01:01:01,750 --> 01:01:02,867
Takara apartment...

1075
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,180
I know there

1076
01:01:05,023 --> 01:01:05,680
Where is it?

1077
01:01:08,695 --> 01:01:10,547
Kashiwagi-san is...

1078
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,367
Hey

1079
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,016
Oh that's you

1080
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:14,984
Is Yukari in?

1081
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:17,250
Yukari?
She is not here

1082
01:01:19,141 --> 01:01:21,203
But they sent her package.

1083
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:23,070
So I am in trouble

1084
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:25,555
I borrow some money from her but

1085
01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:28,797
Here is too small

1086
01:01:29,422 --> 01:01:31,383
Hey,What happen?

1087
01:01:41,516 --> 01:01:42,187
Nagano

1088
01:01:45,336 --> 01:01:47,031
Oh that's you

1089
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:48,984
I came here while you were away.

1090
01:01:49,344 --> 01:01:50,172
Sorry

1091
01:01:51,156 --> 01:01:52,023
What happen?

1092
01:01:52,141 --> 01:01:55,008
Since you were working so hard.

1093
01:01:55,070 --> 01:01:55,711
What happen?

1094
01:01:55,851 --> 01:01:57,141
That's a 108m guy

1095
01:01:57,187 --> 01:01:57,664
Let me see

1096
01:01:58,867 --> 01:02:01,687
He really is there, isn't he? I'm surprised.

1097
01:02:21,249 --> 01:02:22,038
Ken?

1098
01:02:23,023 --> 01:02:23,750
Ken?

1099
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:24,617
What?

1100
01:02:24,750 --> 01:02:26,789
There is a guest for you

1101
01:02:32,578 --> 01:02:33,523
What can I do for you?

1102
01:02:34,461 --> 01:02:37,172
I heard your longest throw is 108 meters.

1103
01:02:38,086 --> 01:02:40,203
I didn't know you got injured

1104
01:02:41,164 --> 01:02:41,797
What happen?

1105
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:45,359
Can you tell me?

1106
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:47,062
I got car accident

1107
01:02:47,586 --> 01:02:50,492
You're young and you drink.

1108
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,227
You'll never recover from that injury.

1109
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:56,203
You are too noisy

1110
01:02:59,273 --> 01:03:00,023
Who are you?

1111
01:03:03,141 --> 01:03:03,992
This is my business card

1112
01:03:07,898 --> 01:03:09,516
The same scout as Hamada.

1113
01:03:11,078 --> 01:03:12,445
Do you know him?

1114
01:03:13,078 --> 01:03:16,555
He stayed here too

1115
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,852
He was very nice man

1116
01:03:19,312 --> 01:03:21,258
He took care of Nobuko too

1117
01:03:21,687 --> 01:03:22,672
Who is Nobuko?

1118
01:03:22,968 --> 01:03:24,280
She is a sister of him

1119
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:27,202
Is she here?

1120
01:03:27,538 --> 01:03:31,616
She is in Nagano, she sometime go back here

1121
01:03:32,398 --> 01:03:34,124
I don't see her lately

1122
01:03:34,593 --> 01:03:35,820
Mind your own business

1123
01:03:36,921 --> 01:03:37,968
You talk too much

1124
01:03:38,085 --> 01:03:40,218
You should stop talking too

1125
01:03:40,694 --> 01:03:43,616
Don't be rude in front of customers.

1126
01:03:44,179 --> 01:03:46,960
You can't work as farmer properly

1127
01:03:47,226 --> 01:03:48,233
What did you say?

1128
01:03:48,335 --> 01:03:49,093
Calm down

1129
01:03:50,429 --> 01:03:51,983
I'm leaving now

1130
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,124
I want to ask him before I leave

1131
01:03:56,905 --> 01:03:59,335
Did Hamada know about your arm?

1132
01:03:59,773 --> 01:04:01,905
Yes, I sent him my X-ray photo

1133
01:04:02,187 --> 01:04:03,827
Where did you get that treatment?

1134
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,983
You said you want to ask me one thing

1135
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:07,890
Please answer it

1136
01:04:09,046 --> 01:04:09,874
You can't?

1137
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:13,014
It's a surgery called Inuzuka in Nagano.

1138
01:04:13,108 --> 01:04:13,616
Right,Ken?

1139
01:04:16,507 --> 01:04:17,483
What did you do!

1140
01:04:25,304 --> 01:04:27,413
He's a troubled man.

1141
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:30,108
He's become a misanthrope.

1142
01:04:33,124 --> 01:04:34,874
I have a favor of you

1143
01:04:36,804 --> 01:04:38,608
Can I see the Nobuko's photo?

1144
01:04:39,007 --> 01:04:40,374
Nobuko's photo?

1145
01:04:41,249 --> 01:04:45,093
That photo is.....yes...right there

1146
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:53,374
Wait

1147
01:04:58,335 --> 01:05:00,358
I met your sister other day

1148
01:05:02,819 --> 01:05:05,124
It's a bar called Silver Place in Hondocho.

1149
01:05:06,468 --> 01:05:09,140
I wanted to ask her about Hamada

1150
01:05:10,772 --> 01:05:14,178
But she has disappeared in sudden

1151
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:15,624
Really?

1152
01:05:15,898 --> 01:05:16,554
Yes

1153
01:05:17,671 --> 01:05:19,444
I have no idea why she has disappeared

1154
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:22,179
I think you know it

1155
01:05:24,296 --> 01:05:25,929
Tell me everything you know.

1156
01:05:25,983 --> 01:05:27,319
I don't know about her!

1157
01:05:27,976 --> 01:05:29,069
I've cut ties with my sister.

1158
01:05:29,210 --> 01:05:29,702
Why?

1159
01:05:29,795 --> 01:05:31,240
She betrayed my seniority.

1160
01:05:32,390 --> 01:05:33,280
Who is the seniority?

1161
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:34,890
Mind your own business

1162
01:05:35,483 --> 01:05:39,905
I don't like Hamada.
He's old enough to have cheated on his sister.

1163
01:05:40,593 --> 01:05:44,882
You think Hamada approached your sister to recruit you?

1164
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,054
I've heard from my sister about me

1165
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:49,608
He said he takes care of me

1166
01:05:50,726 --> 01:05:52,648
Even though they're a poor ball club.

1167
01:05:52,976 --> 01:05:55,788
My sister was going to use me, too.

1168
01:05:58,507 --> 01:06:01,374
But you broke your arm in the accident.

1169
01:06:03,069 --> 01:06:05,796
So You didn't have to join the Eagles

1170
01:06:08,624 --> 01:06:14,843
But Hamada-san died because he was disappointed with your injuries?

1171
01:06:16,132 --> 01:06:17,218
What do you think?

1172
01:06:17,243 --> 01:06:18,593
I don't care about him

1173
01:06:19,054 --> 01:06:22,538
Where were you the night Hamada dead ?

1174
01:06:23,671 --> 01:06:26,648
At hospital.
Why you ask that?

1175
01:06:27,882 --> 01:06:29,148
Are you sure?

1176
01:06:29,514 --> 01:06:30,631
You can ask the hospital

1177
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:36,991
I'm sorry

1178
01:06:38,679 --> 01:06:40,726
You and I have a connection.

1179
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:44,101
108m, you have a strong shoulder

1180
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,718
Actually that's the same record I have.

1181
01:06:54,398 --> 01:06:55,265
Hello?

1182
01:07:03,046 --> 01:07:04,218
Hello?

1183
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:05,804
Where is the doctor?

1184
01:07:06,304 --> 01:07:07,749
He is sleeping there

1185
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:09,882
A medical examination?

1186
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:11,140
Yes

1187
01:07:13,155 --> 01:07:14,890
So Please come in

1188
01:07:17,585 --> 01:07:19,913
Ah, Please turn on the heater by yourself

1189
01:07:20,351 --> 01:07:21,030
Yes

1190
01:07:26,421 --> 01:07:29,226
Doctor! your patient is here

1191
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,420
atchoo!

1192
01:07:39,265 --> 01:07:40,179
What's wrong?

1193
01:07:40,429 --> 01:07:41,874
You look fine

1194
01:07:43,132 --> 01:07:44,171
atchoo!.

1195
01:07:44,952 --> 01:07:46,804
I got cold so I was sleeping

1196
01:07:47,187 --> 01:07:49,280
My elbow is a little sore.

1197
01:07:49,523 --> 01:07:50,749
Take off your jacket

1198
01:07:55,601 --> 01:07:56,179
Take your seat

1199
01:08:04,952 --> 01:08:06,148
It's like nothing

1200
01:08:06,694 --> 01:08:09,327
Is it neuralgia?
You want me to give you a shot?

1201
01:08:09,952 --> 01:08:10,952
Hey Tane!

1202
01:08:11,288 --> 01:08:12,351
What's wrong?

1203
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,897
Get ready for the injection.

1204
01:08:14,069 --> 01:08:14,835
Yes

1205
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:16,452
I want to ask something

1206
01:08:16,492 --> 01:08:18,006
What?
Health insurance?

1207
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:19,116
No no

1208
01:08:19,882 --> 01:08:22,757
I have a friend who is a medical equipment salesman.

1209
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:24,241
Can you meet him once?

1210
01:08:24,749 --> 01:08:26,499
Oh you have come here for that

1211
01:08:26,726 --> 01:08:29,718
Neuralgia's just a side thing.
You don't have to do anything right now.

1212
01:08:30,179 --> 01:08:31,038
You are fine

1213
01:08:31,413 --> 01:08:33,890
I'm sorry to ask this but your X-ray is...

1214
01:08:35,218 --> 01:08:39,085
Our machine is old. When we get the money, we'll buy a new one.

1215
01:08:39,218 --> 01:08:39,866
Hey

1216
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,905
Stretch your arms out and hold them tight.

1217
01:08:46,148 --> 01:08:50,929
I saw a picture of someone who had X-rays taken here the other day.

1218
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:53,999
It was taken well

1219
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:58,265
That my friend said

1220
01:08:59,178 --> 01:09:03,460
He told me to ask you which machine maker is it.

1221
01:09:05,093 --> 01:09:10,124
You misunderstand something.
We don't have a patient with a broken left arm.

1222
01:09:10,421 --> 01:09:13,976
I see.
He told me he took X-ray here

1223
01:09:14,741 --> 01:09:15,905
Who said that?

1224
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:17,483
I don't know

1225
01:09:17,508 --> 01:09:18,413
Hello?

1226
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,343
So something is wrong?

1227
01:09:21,819 --> 01:09:23,233
Of course it is.

1228
01:09:24,554 --> 01:09:25,968
Where is the photo?

1229
01:09:26,671 --> 01:09:28,866
Doctor, there is a call for you

1230
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:30,460
OK I will go

1231
01:09:39,515 --> 01:09:40,921
Hello? It's me

1232
01:09:41,257 --> 01:09:43,413
Inuzuka, What?

1233
01:09:59,038 --> 01:10:01,468
Well..I'm leaving now

1234
01:10:06,155 --> 01:10:07,437
Hey, wait

1235
01:10:11,452 --> 01:10:13,726
Can I have your business card?

1236
01:10:15,054 --> 01:10:15,726
My business card?

1237
01:10:17,038 --> 01:10:17,733
Why?

1238
01:10:17,905 --> 01:10:22,382
Well..I'd like to meet your friend from that medical institution someday.

1239
01:10:23,866 --> 01:10:26,491
If so, I can bring him here

1240
01:10:28,366 --> 01:10:30,054
He is called Kentaro Takemura

1241
01:10:57,655 --> 01:11:00,601
Hello? this is Inuzuka surgency

1242
01:11:01,952 --> 01:11:03,796
Our doctor is out now

1243
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:07,225
What?

1244
01:11:08,475 --> 01:11:09,460
School right?

1245
01:11:10,139 --> 01:11:12,210
Because I got a call from Teacher Hatano

1246
01:11:12,561 --> 01:11:14,858
What? Teacher  Hatano?

1247
01:11:15,077 --> 01:11:18,171
He came in three days ago to hand in his resignation.

1248
01:11:18,710 --> 01:11:20,374
I was surprised because it was sudden

1249
01:11:21,507 --> 01:11:23,468
He has a chest illness

1250
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:25,803
I think he shouldn't overdo it

1251
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:27,218
Is he in the boarding house?

1252
01:11:27,514 --> 01:11:29,194
He returned to his hometown

1253
01:11:29,444 --> 01:11:30,155
He returned to his hometown?

1254
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:31,733
Where

1255
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,100
Around here

1256
01:11:33,585 --> 01:11:35,257
Do you know Okuyamada Onsen?

1257
01:11:35,655 --> 01:11:37,632
It ’s a village near that side.

1258
01:11:38,413 --> 01:11:40,085
I hope he'll get better soon

1259
01:11:42,412 --> 01:11:44,021
Where is the Mr. Hatano's birth area?

1260
01:11:44,421 --> 01:11:45,288
Let me see...

1261
01:11:45,780 --> 01:11:47,882
He graduated from Fujikura Agricultural High School

1262
01:11:49,788 --> 01:11:52,171
And entered Nagano Agricultural University

1263
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:55,733
That's it

1264
01:11:57,436 --> 01:11:57,991
Fujikura Agricultural High School...

1265
01:11:58,249 --> 01:11:58,866
Yes

1266
01:12:00,264 --> 01:12:02,319
I'm sorry but can I see his boarding note?

1267
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:03,952
I want to see beginning of last month one

1268
01:12:04,046 --> 01:12:04,507
Yes

1269
01:12:06,514 --> 01:12:10,460
That's why I was against it from the beginning, if it meant crossing a dangerous bridge.

1270
01:12:11,514 --> 01:12:12,655
Why did this happen

1271
01:12:12,694 --> 01:12:13,600
But uncle...

1272
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,780
You always said you wanted money

1273
01:12:18,968 --> 01:12:19,999
No one is bad

1274
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:22,647
I just wanted the money

1275
01:12:23,710 --> 01:12:24,522
There is a guest for you

1276
01:12:25,327 --> 01:12:25,866
Who?

1277
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:27,249
Kashiwagi-san

1278
01:12:27,421 --> 01:12:28,303
Kashiwagi?

1279
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,108
Through him

1280
01:12:38,178 --> 01:12:38,905
Please come in

1281
01:12:42,389 --> 01:12:43,913
I thought you would come

1282
01:12:44,389 --> 01:12:45,186
Please make yourself at home

1283
01:12:49,983 --> 01:12:50,960
Please serve tea

1284
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:54,030
Or would you like a whiskey?

1285
01:12:54,905 --> 01:12:55,796
Either is fine

1286
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:04,053
You knew who I was.

1287
01:13:07,155 --> 01:13:08,444
Then it's easy to talk

1288
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:11,413
Mr. Hamada died here

1289
01:13:12,796 --> 01:13:13,303
No

1290
01:13:14,202 --> 01:13:16,889
Mr. Hamada was killed here.
I'd like to talk to you about his thoughts.

1291
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:20,241
Was Mr. Hamada killed after all?

1292
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:23,983
You've got a poker face.

1293
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:27,975
Do you think I have something to do with Mr. Hamada's poetry?

1294
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:29,780
Of course

1295
01:13:32,553 --> 01:13:33,514
Ok Let's talk about

1296
01:13:38,921 --> 01:13:40,139
You can stay here

1297
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:44,616
Hatano-kun

1298
01:13:45,725 --> 01:13:48,882
Let's think again why Mr. Hamada came here

1299
01:13:50,546 --> 01:13:53,327
He was staying in Nagano whenever he negotiated with Kikukawa

1300
01:13:54,210 --> 01:13:56,319
Why did he come to a hot spring so far away?

1301
01:13:57,772 --> 01:14:02,499
He came here because he had something to do here other than the Kikukawa's negotiation

1302
01:14:03,718 --> 01:14:07,171
For example he had promised to meet someone here

1303
01:14:07,491 --> 01:14:08,632
Oh, with whom?

1304
01:14:09,460 --> 01:14:10,452
Anyone else

1305
01:14:12,178 --> 01:14:13,600
Dr. Inuzuka of Surgery?

1306
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:17,498
Or Kentaro Takemura?

1307
01:14:18,944 --> 01:14:20,843
He had promised to meet someone here

1308
01:14:21,756 --> 01:14:22,326
I see

1309
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:25,382
By the way,Mrs.

1310
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:29,421
You knew Mr. Hamada was coming here

1311
01:14:30,218 --> 01:14:32,702
So you guided Mr. Hamada to a special room

1312
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:35,561
Then you were with Mr. Hamada all the time

1313
01:14:36,249 --> 01:14:39,577
You didn't give Mr. Hamada the opportunity to talk to others

1314
01:14:40,671 --> 01:14:42,522
When the time comes, your testimony will be ...

1315
01:14:43,350 --> 01:14:46,202
It was to make Hamada-san's death a suicide.

1316
01:14:51,335 --> 01:14:53,616
Well...Dead men tell no tales

1317
01:14:55,499 --> 01:14:58,788
There was no moon that day.
No one tries to climb the back mountain

1318
01:15:00,514 --> 01:15:01,592
Mr.Hatano

1319
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:03,764
You invited him

1320
01:15:04,568 --> 01:15:06,756
You've successfully deceived Hamada through her.

1321
01:15:08,685 --> 01:15:10,232
That's interesting

1322
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:13,100
It's your own imagination

1323
01:15:14,288 --> 01:15:16,421
So that this person's testimony is unsubstantiated

1324
01:15:17,397 --> 01:15:19,413
There is no evidence that this person is lying

1325
01:15:19,936 --> 01:15:20,452
Isn't that right?

1326
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:21,835
Listen to me

1327
01:15:22,889 --> 01:15:24,921
This was very carefully planned.

1328
01:15:27,678 --> 01:15:28,811
The mastermind is you

1329
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:31,241
Why me?

1330
01:15:32,045 --> 01:15:32,561
Hatano-kun

1331
01:15:33,678 --> 01:15:36,607
You had a deep grudge against Mr. Hamada

1332
01:15:37,631 --> 01:15:38,506
Why you think so?

1333
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:40,952
About Nobuko Takemura

1334
01:15:42,421 --> 01:15:42,983
Hatano-kun

1335
01:15:43,975 --> 01:15:46,194
You are Kentaro Takemura's high school senior

1336
01:15:47,624 --> 01:15:50,632
And you got to know her and loved her

1337
01:15:53,772 --> 01:15:56,811
You can't drink but you sometime visit the bar, why?

1338
01:15:58,046 --> 01:15:59,397
You wanted to persuade her

1339
01:16:00,632 --> 01:16:03,835
But Nobuko chose Hamada over you

1340
01:16:05,249 --> 01:16:06,803
That's the primary motivation.

1341
01:16:08,124 --> 01:16:10,077
And then You were greedy

1342
01:16:11,561 --> 01:16:16,405
If you make Kentaro, who holds the record for longest throw, 108 meters, a great pitcher

1343
01:16:17,436 --> 01:16:20,053
You know you'll get big money in the future

1344
01:16:21,663 --> 01:16:23,413
To that end, ask Hamada to give up

1345
01:16:24,093 --> 01:16:28,132
You have to sell Kentaro to some team

1346
01:16:29,093 --> 01:16:30,546
Luckily...

1347
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:34,749
Kentaro misunderstood that his sister was being played by Mr. Hamada

1348
01:16:36,483 --> 01:16:38,991
His left arm fracture was a lie

1349
01:16:39,616 --> 01:16:42,186
You got a X-rays from the surgeon, Dr. Inuzuka.

1350
01:16:43,858 --> 01:16:44,858
You wanted Hamada to give up

1351
01:16:47,327 --> 01:16:48,038
But

1352
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,514
The fracture will heal someday

1353
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:53,632
so I don't think Mr. Hamada gave up

1354
01:16:55,053 --> 01:16:56,499
So you suddenly came up with an idea

1355
01:16:56,936 --> 01:16:59,452
You planned to kill Mr. Hamada

1356
01:17:03,303 --> 01:17:04,405
Kashiwagi-san

1357
01:17:04,709 --> 01:17:06,725
Your reasoning is pretty good

1358
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:09,843
I'm very impressed

1359
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:12,593
but there is no evidence

1360
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,749
Can you give the police clear evidence that I'm the culprit?

1361
01:17:19,585 --> 01:17:20,389
Hatano-san

1362
01:17:21,538 --> 01:17:26,374
On the day Hamada-san died, you asked another teacher to take his place on your shifts.

1363
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:29,811
And

1364
01:17:31,006 --> 01:17:36,327
She is your real mother.
My scenario is perfect

1365
01:17:38,132 --> 01:17:38,928
Hatano-kun

1366
01:17:41,382 --> 01:17:44,991
You didn't cheat school papers

1367
01:17:46,061 --> 01:17:46,686
Kentaro!

1368
01:17:47,327 --> 01:17:47,913
Let me go!

1369
01:17:48,608 --> 01:17:49,319
Calm down!

1370
01:17:49,819 --> 01:17:50,553
Calm down!

1371
01:17:56,936 --> 01:17:58,280
Stop it!

1372
01:18:00,577 --> 01:18:02,507
Hey you! what are you doing?

1373
01:18:02,710 --> 01:18:03,249
Get off me!

1374
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:04,421
Get off me!

1375
01:18:06,194 --> 01:18:06,741
Kentaro-kun!

1376
01:18:17,327 --> 01:18:17,960
Damn it!

1377
01:18:20,178 --> 01:18:21,530
My arm's fine.

1378
01:18:21,555 --> 01:18:22,827
Everyone teases me

1379
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:24,936
Stop it!

1380
01:18:25,225 --> 01:18:26,319
Calm down,Kentaro!

1381
01:18:27,171 --> 01:18:27,671
Damn it!

1382
01:18:34,100 --> 01:18:35,835
Calm down, Toru

1383
01:18:39,014 --> 01:18:39,796
It's over.

1384
01:18:40,647 --> 01:18:43,764
I've got everything figured out.

1385
01:18:46,030 --> 01:18:49,670
Before the police came I....

1386
01:19:42,264 --> 01:19:42,709
Ball!

1387
01:19:46,116 --> 01:19:47,217
Change pitcher!

1388
01:20:00,912 --> 01:20:01,638
Safe!

1389
01:20:04,491 --> 01:20:08,029
What's wrong?
Kikukawa was pitching safely up to the 9th inning

1390
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,702
He suddenly got bad

1391
01:20:09,811 --> 01:20:12,670
Two outs, runners on first and third, and next up is Ogihara.

1392
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,631
There was a turbulence in the 9th inning

1393
01:20:15,998 --> 01:20:19,045
The game is decided by the problem of the relief pitcher

1394
01:20:19,397 --> 01:20:21,350
The coach's command is important

1395
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:25,092
An unknown pitcher is approaching the mound

1396
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,764
He is Takemura from Fujikura Agricultural high school

1397
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:32,084
He is called a phantom pitcher

1398
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:33,655
That's true

1399
01:20:34,303 --> 01:20:36,076
Change the Eagles player.

1400
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:39,366
Pitcher replaces Takemura

1401
01:20:40,467 --> 01:20:42,912
Change from Kikukawa to Takemura

1402
01:20:43,295 --> 01:20:45,459
Pitcher Takemura uniform number 9

1403
01:20:46,038 --> 01:20:48,498
Shizue-san.
He is the Takemura

1404
01:20:50,483 --> 01:20:51,600
He is called a phantom pitcher

1405
01:20:52,858 --> 01:20:53,936
I worry about him

1406
01:21:05,178 --> 01:21:05,998
Strike!

1407
01:21:16,834 --> 01:21:17,608
Strike!

1408
01:21:29,936 --> 01:21:31,866
Strike! Out!

1409
01:21:33,896 --> 01:21:34,568
Game set!

1410
01:21:42,561 --> 01:21:44,834
The Eagles win 3 to 2

1411
01:21:46,038 --> 01:21:49,967
Thank you for watching the game until the end today

1412
01:21:53,131 --> 01:21:54,186
It was a good game

1413
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:56,459
Another star was born

1414
01:21:57,584 --> 01:22:00,944
I found out that Mr. Hamada was a first-class scout

1415
01:22:02,209 --> 01:22:06,944
When we were chasing Kikukawa, Hamada-san was holding the jewel.

1416
01:22:09,178 --> 01:22:12,530
Mr. Hamada's life is on Takemura's left arm

1417
01:22:14,373 --> 01:22:18,030
He will be a big pitcher who will carry the Japanese baseball world in the future

1418
01:22:18,686 --> 01:22:21,092
After all my dad was great as a scout

1419
01:22:22,983 --> 01:22:28,584
I found out that my dad has pride in his work Meet the iPhone

1420
01:22:29,155 --> 01:22:31,975
But scouting is a behind-the-scenes job.

1421
01:22:33,014 --> 01:22:33,748
Is that Ok with you?

1422
01:22:35,163 --> 01:22:35,663
What?

1423
01:22:37,217 --> 01:22:39,233
Take baseball away from me, and there's nothing left.

1424
01:22:40,678 --> 01:22:43,358
Can you still follow me?

1425
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,631
So, Can I throw this away?

1426
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:52,881
Yes

1427
01:23:04,288 --> 01:23:04,616
Hey

1428
01:23:06,021 --> 01:23:07,170
Let's go to visit Mr. Hamada's grave from now on

1429
01:23:07,858 --> 01:23:10,350
Yes,Let's take Kikukawa and Takemura together

1430
01:23:15,170 --> 01:23:24,842
The end

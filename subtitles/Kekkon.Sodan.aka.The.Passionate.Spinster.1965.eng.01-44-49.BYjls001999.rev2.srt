00:00:14,306 --> 00:00:16,759
I've finally turned to 30

3
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:29,062
Marriage Counseling / The Passionate Spinster (1965)
Kekkon Sodan (1965)

4
00:01:42,038 --> 00:01:47,561
This wig is trendy worldwide and is used in place of a hat

5
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:53,944
This is durable and can be used in the bath.

6
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,838
Can we take a photo together,Furukawa?

7
00:02:03,822 --> 00:02:04,549
Thanks

8
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:10,197
Oh torii, I think I don't need to be taken

9
00:02:10,385 --> 00:02:11,814
Never mind

10
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:17,348
I'm looking forward to your wedding next year

11
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,036
I won't get married soon.
I feel like playing more

12
00:02:23,942 --> 00:02:25,387
I'm still 23 years old

13
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:37,232
Thanks

14
00:02:38,089 --> 00:02:39,222
He's Takabayashi

15
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:40,199
Ogoshi department's

16
00:02:40,503 --> 00:02:42,863
He's a Don Juan, isn't he?

17
00:02:42,909 --> 00:02:46,449
Shimako is worried about getting married

18
00:02:46,474 --> 00:02:47,206
They are same age

19
00:02:47,347 --> 00:02:49,089
I wonder how she feels about turning 30.

20
00:02:49,464 --> 00:02:50,363
It's kind a sad

21
00:03:00,756 --> 00:03:03,990
Next is your turn.
Let me know about your wedding party.

22
00:03:04,287 --> 00:03:06,248
I'll come from Hamamatsu

23
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:10,951
I'll be waiting there

24
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:16,770
She's having a hard time getting a new job right after getting married.

25
00:03:17,692 --> 00:03:19,497
She got married right away because she was relocating.

26
00:03:19,935 --> 00:03:20,692
I see

27
00:03:21,192 --> 00:03:25,903
I was asked by her to take her to Hamamatsu when I was relocating

28
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:28,408
Hamatatsu is his home town

29
00:03:28,986 --> 00:03:30,002
You made their connection.

30
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,954
It's kind of

31
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:45,775
Tsurukawa

32
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:49,869
I thought you've gone by car

33
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:54,361
My boss asked me to see off at airport by car

34
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,713
Shall we get a cab?
Where are you going?

35
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:01,783
I'm going by bus to Mejiro

36
00:04:02,267 --> 00:04:03,384
I wanna go to Shibuya too

37
00:04:03,853 --> 00:04:06,103
I'll get Toyoko line from Shibuya.
This will be convenient for me.

38
00:04:12,447 --> 00:04:14,220
Sorry to bother you

39
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,642
Your kimono gets dirty if you get on a bus

40
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:22,051
Takabayashi from Ogoshi department store likes you guys

41
00:04:22,918 --> 00:04:23,879
He said you guys were lovely

42
00:04:24,434 --> 00:04:25,863
Only for young girls, right?

43
00:04:26,535 --> 00:04:27,684
No way

44
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,817
Or just my Kimono?

45
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:34,324
Give me a break

46
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:39,419
He's good eye for women

47
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:41,974
I know that

48
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,599
He's famous

49
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:47,218
How about you?

50
00:04:49,398 --> 00:04:50,452
I don't

51
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,562
I am taking care of my sick wife

52
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,351
I'm sorry

53
00:04:56,187 --> 00:04:57,648
How's her?

54
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:00,671
She's ok

55
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:02,945
The sickness is annoying

56
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,835
She always stay at hospital?

57
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,445
Yes

58
00:05:06,023 --> 00:05:06,835
does she move?

59
00:05:07,742 --> 00:05:12,312
I think she don't have to change the hospital

60
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,788
You'll go with your kids?

61
00:05:15,359 --> 00:05:18,218
Yeah, I will take them

62
00:05:19,171 --> 00:05:20,343
It's hard

63
00:05:20,656 --> 00:05:21,968
I'm used to it

64
00:05:23,928 --> 00:05:25,467
Stop at Shibuya

65
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,021
Shibuya, OK?

66
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:28,185
Thanks

67
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,951
I'll stay in the car

68
00:05:52,074 --> 00:05:59,074
It is very difficult to get married in Japan today.

69
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:06,840
A business called a marriage agency that introduces marriage partners was established

70
00:06:07,574 --> 00:06:11,918
The percentage here is Women for 60%, men for 40%

71
00:06:12,308 --> 00:06:16,004
The most age range is 26 to 30

72
00:06:16,285 --> 00:06:19,754
The ratio is so unbalanced

73
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:26,535
Men want younger women Women want men's height and educational background

74
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:31,121
There are 24 public match making centers in Tokyo

75
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:33,090
120 in Japan

76
00:06:33,324 --> 00:06:37,285
And there are more private match making centers

77
00:06:38,004 --> 00:06:41,301
It's easy to start this business

78
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,251
Yes we are

79
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:56,595
We Introduce women after joining

80
00:06:58,518 --> 00:06:59,448
Sorry

81
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:11,074
Did you fill in?

82
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,277
A man who graduate university

83
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,887
Up to 35 yrs old.
You don't care how he looks

84
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,387
But his height is over 170cm

85
00:07:24,458 --> 00:07:29,786
It's ok if he drink, but he must look after home

86
00:07:30,628 --> 00:07:32,878
a man who does a man who does not interfere with his wife not interfere with his wife

87
00:07:34,128 --> 00:07:36,519
He can live together

88
00:07:40,352 --> 00:07:41,930
These are really common case

89
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:47,391
You are educated and beautiful

90
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:53,305
I'll introduce you a man now

91
00:07:53,899 --> 00:07:55,415
Wanna see him?

92
00:08:04,337 --> 00:08:05,532
Asako

93
00:08:11,756 --> 00:08:16,233
He graduated from Tokyo uni, 29yrs old, work for west Japan industrial

94
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:25,020
He'll transfered to L.A so He wants her to go there together for 3 yrs

95
00:08:27,627 --> 00:08:29,619
Do you afraid to go abroad?

96
00:08:29,963 --> 00:08:31,697
I don't care

97
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:33,822
Wanna see him?

98
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,479
It cost 1000 yen for admission, and another 1000 yen for introduction fee

99
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:55,851
Is there company house in LA?

100
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,531
Yes

101
00:08:58,359 --> 00:09:01,827
I'll need to take over former people

102
00:09:03,314 --> 00:09:07,283
Do you need to learn English?

103
00:09:08,306 --> 00:09:11,119
It will work out

104
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:17,349
How many Japanese people there?

105
00:09:18,786 --> 00:09:22,348
I guess about 10.
They told me they sent more people

106
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:29,441
Sorry but I need to go to Haneda airport to see off my boss

107
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:31,824
I'm sorry

00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:33,106
Please keep eating

109
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:35,285

Please stay as it is

113
00:10:05,698 --> 00:10:09,995
Hayakawa called me just now

114
00:10:10,323 --> 00:10:13,174
He told me he needed to go to Haneda airport to see off his boss

115
00:10:14,537 --> 00:10:16,201
Oh so on the way?

116
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:20,342
He seems to like you a lot

117
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,060
What do you think?

118
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,553
He's not bad

119
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:28,685
But I need more time

120
00:10:28,834 --> 00:10:30,428
Sure

121
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,435
He'll be your partner

122
00:10:33,396 --> 00:10:38,849
I'll arrange you next meeting

123
00:10:40,226 --> 00:10:43,820
Can you come here the day after tomorrow?

124
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:46,898
I'll call him to arrange you next meeting

125
00:10:47,132 --> 00:10:49,101
I'll visit you after working

126
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:56,947
He told me you were so lovely and looked young

127
00:10:57,846 --> 00:10:59,244
You must be virgin

128
00:11:08,396 --> 00:11:09,607
Micchan is late

129
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:12,224
She is having meeting

130
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:14,826
She is having dating

131
00:11:15,334 --> 00:11:16,435

133
00:11:20,294 --> 00:11:22,169
They must get married soon

134
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,787
She worries about you

135
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:26,818
She's old fashion

136
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,552
I don't care if my sister get married earlier than me

137
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:38,441
You looked after her very well.
She's very appreciate about you

138
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:41,710
I'm glad about that , but

139
00:11:43,359 --> 00:11:45,538
It seems I bother them

140
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:46,781
Don’t think too much

141
00:11:47,156 --> 00:11:51,757
I'm too old, unmarried woman

142
00:11:52,808 --> 00:11:54,191
But I hope someone likes me

143
00:11:55,332 --> 00:11:57,597
You hope I leave this home,right?

144
00:11:58,816 --> 00:12:00,261
What are you saying?

145
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:02,793
Do you have a world map?

146
00:12:03,246 --> 00:12:03,972
Yes

147
00:12:04,777 --> 00:12:05,652
Let me see

148
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:06,496
For what?

149
00:12:06,824 --> 00:12:07,847
I just wanna see it

150
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,282
Tea, taste good

151
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:23,938
Oh right

152
00:12:27,701 --> 00:12:29,131
It's same tea

153
00:12:32,904 --> 00:12:33,795
Thanks

154
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,053
Are you going to travel

155
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,154
Kind of

156
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:45,418
Come to my house?
My sis might be there

157
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:47,918
Maybe next time

158
00:12:50,766 --> 00:12:52,164
I don't care about your sis, but

159
00:12:53,304 --> 00:12:54,015
It's late

160
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:59,594
I know how you feel

161
00:13:03,918 --> 00:13:04,840
I'm home

162
00:13:12,233 --> 00:13:16,858
You know what?
Men are so terrible

163
00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:28,092
Hayakawa told me you were educated and very neat

164
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:32,037
and he wanted to take you abroad

165
00:13:33,678 --> 00:13:46,092
But he had a match making date with a girl who was 24 years old introduced by his boss

166
00:13:48,636 --> 00:13:50,714
After meeting with me? at Haneda?

167
00:13:52,776 --> 00:13:58,425
He liked her because she was young and graduated from Japan women uni.

168
00:14:00,891 --> 00:14:05,906
He must be fond of her because of his work

169
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:14,305
I feel sorry about him.
I will give you back the fee

170
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:19,757
I'm sorry for that

171
00:14:21,124 --> 00:14:24,710
I'm in trouble.
I don't need this money

172
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,656
I'll keep this next introduction fee

173
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:32,187
Next man looks nice

174
00:14:34,427 --> 00:14:35,294
Next man ?

175
00:14:36,716 --> 00:14:45,161
You should broaden the conditions for the men you marry.

176
00:14:45,974 --> 00:14:51,185
There are many opportunities for you.
Meet men as many as possible

177
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,098
I am the third son of a farmer in Nagano.
I like to use electricity

178
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:04,184
I work at my grandfather's shop.
I graduated from high school and college in night school

179
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,660
I know nothing beside my specialties

180
00:15:07,895 --> 00:15:09,582
You might hate it

181
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:17,192
I will work at Asian Textile right after graduating from high school.

182
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,990
You have better education than I

183
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:24,412
I know nothing

184
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,772
But I'm sure I'm good at about electrical things

185
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:31,733
I'll own my shop soon

186
00:15:38,245 --> 00:15:38,839
Eh?

187
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,449
I know but

188
00:15:44,847 --> 00:15:49,027
You are not kid.
You don't have to listen to your parents anymore

189
00:15:50,011 --> 00:15:53,480
I can't count on you.
Sorry

190
00:15:58,075 --> 00:16:02,661
He's so terrible.
I feel sorry about him

191
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,154
I know you listened to our conversation

192
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:11,068
I was so upset

193
00:16:13,388 --> 00:16:14,427
I'm sorry

194
00:16:18,239 --> 00:16:20,348
His uncle is opposed to your marriage

195
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:26,989
He told me you were 30yrs unmarried woman.
Something must be wrong

196
00:16:55,066 --> 00:16:59,262
I've wanted to introduce a man.
Wanna meet him?

197
00:17:01,023 --> 00:17:03,007
He's rich and nice but

198
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:06,906
But he's little old

199
00:17:09,443 --> 00:17:10,451
How old?

200
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:15,568
Before 50

201
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,817
You can't?

202
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:32,007
Don't be rush

203
00:17:32,937 --> 00:17:34,539
I'll keep connecting

204
00:17:36,935 --> 00:17:38,334
Cheer up

205
00:17:39,912 --> 00:17:42,498
There will be next chance

206
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:44,787
Excuse me

207
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:52,925
He told me you were 30yrs unmarried woman.
Something must be wrong

208
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:57,808
He's rich and nice but

209
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:00,199
Before 50

210
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,129
He looks younger than in the photo

211
00:18:04,597 --> 00:18:07,496
He lives in Wakayama

212
00:18:11,293 --> 00:18:14,707
He own orchard

213
00:18:15,371 --> 00:18:16,957
It is said that he is expanding his business

214
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:21,011
He often come to Tokyo for his work

215
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,613
See the Remarks column

216
00:18:24,433 --> 00:18:27,480
He lost his wife last yr and has 2 kids

217
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:33,488
But his grand mom look after his son

218
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,504
So you don't have to worry

219
00:18:42,665 --> 00:18:43,869
Smell good

220
00:18:44,579 --> 00:18:45,884
I feel nostalgic

221
00:18:46,767 --> 00:18:49,056
This remind me of my childhood

222
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:51,478
Your dad worked about ship?

223
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:54,454
He worked for Nippon Yusen

224
00:18:56,345 --> 00:18:58,126
Did he die in a submarine attack?

225
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,486
I just remembered

226
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:09,462
He worked around a dock

227
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:12,267
I forgot the name of ship

228
00:19:13,267 --> 00:19:14,837
It was nice ship

229
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:20,665
Since he worked on land, he would often bring me along.

230
00:19:34,917 --> 00:19:36,104
It taste good

231
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,854
Another beer

232
00:19:38,253 --> 00:19:39,924
I get drunk

233
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,557
No worries

234
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,830
I just remembered about my Dad

235
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,423
We brothers and my mother went to pick up my father at the port of Yokohama.

236
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:06,751
We were so small

237
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:09,572
my brother and sister were still babies

238
00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:12,080
I remembered somehow

239
00:20:13,126 --> 00:20:15,900
My father brought me foreign sweets as a souvenir.

240
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:17,822
I was glad

241
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,580
He must be nice

242
00:20:21,509 --> 00:20:23,775
We often ate at restaurants like this on the way home

243
00:20:24,501 --> 00:20:26,619
I forgot the name of restaurant

244
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,486
he liked tatami very much

245
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:37,587
he often slept on the tatami

246
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:46,754
I really miss him.
Sorry

247
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:49,043
Why?

248
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:54,162
I feel like I am with my dad now

249
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,123
Don't get me wrong

250
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,389
Never mind

251
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:05,100
I'll be your dad too if I get married with you

252
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:23,408
you should be more proactive

253
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,619
you should seduce him

254
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,056
He's mine now

255
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:36,478
the wedding will be later

256
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,798
he promised to marry me

257
00:21:44,476 --> 00:21:47,414
you changed into a kimono

258
00:21:48,578 --> 00:21:51,687
I couldn't put on the kimono very well.

259
00:21:52,312 --> 00:21:57,422
I thought you should rest a little after eating breakfast.

260
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,664
Are you still sleepy?

261
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:03,640
I'm not

262
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:06,984
do you regret what happened last night?

263
00:22:11,286 --> 00:22:13,052
So you forgive me

264
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,904
Let's have a meal

265
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:27,866
Tonobe-sensei's motto is a clean marriage.

266
00:22:29,278 --> 00:22:31,028
She might get angry with us

267
00:22:33,934 --> 00:22:38,349
It may not be a good idea to decide to get married immediately after meeting once.

268
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,048
So Let's say this

269
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:49,181
If you come again next month, let's meet again and I will report to her

270
00:22:49,626 --> 00:22:56,058
tell her you're going on a few more dates with him

271
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,887
I'm too honest

272
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:07,207
I'm sure she will understand you

273
00:23:10,688 --> 00:23:19,507
I'll give you pocket money, so please buy whatever you like.

274
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:26,573
don't worry we are dating for marriage

275
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:32,034
I am grateful that you paid the accommodation fee for the inn.

276
00:23:32,651 --> 00:23:34,448
Don't be serious

277
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,081
Last night I received something precious from you

278
00:23:40,831 --> 00:23:42,448
I wanna thank to you

279
00:23:49,238 --> 00:23:50,910
this is great

280
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:52,925
This might be too much

281
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,816
I don't think so

282
00:23:55,152 --> 00:23:57,152
He must like this

283
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:58,519
we are not married yet

284
00:23:58,566 --> 00:24:03,183
When you go on a date, you wear new clothes, don't you?

285
00:24:03,534 --> 00:24:04,589
free to imagine

286
00:24:04,614 --> 00:24:05,589
That's what I thought

287
00:24:05,614 --> 00:24:06,269
Furukawa

288
00:24:06,294 --> 00:24:07,206
I'm here

289
00:24:07,753 --> 00:24:08,816
A phone call for you

290
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:09,925
From your boyfriend

291
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:15,853
sorry to call you

292
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:21,431
I'm in a lot of trouble

293
00:24:22,103 --> 00:24:22,744
What's wrong?

294
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:28,798
I thought I should let you know right away

295
00:24:31,124 --> 00:24:35,991
I was so disgusted with myself.

296
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:42,382
I've been doing this job for a long time, but I'm disappointed in myself.

297
00:24:43,546 --> 00:24:44,819
I was tricked

298
00:24:46,207 --> 00:24:47,012
He's so bad

299
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,246
About Hidaka?

300
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:53,230
Yes

301
00:24:54,644 --> 00:25:00,926
He liked you and I felt safe

302
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:04,346
What happened...

303
00:25:07,909 --> 00:25:16,307
I've been doing this job for a long time and I've also done research on men.

304
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:25,277
He gave in to temptation..

305
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:27,668
What happened?

306
00:25:34,093 --> 00:25:37,773
don't be surprised

307
00:25:39,999 --> 00:25:41,773
he has a wife

308
00:25:43,648 --> 00:25:44,929
She's still alive

309
00:25:53,565 --> 00:25:54,268
Oh no

310
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:00,066
I know how you feel

311
00:26:01,652 --> 00:26:03,230
I feel same

312
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:07,352
I wanted to sue him

313
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:16,522
but I worried about my business reputation

314
00:26:19,483 --> 00:26:23,663
I thought it would be fine to give up if it was such an arranged date.

315
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:31,536
I think it would have been nice to know what he was like before you got married.

316
00:26:34,449 --> 00:26:35,519
Shimako

317
00:26:36,745 --> 00:26:38,324
Don't be sad too much

318
00:26:39,706 --> 00:26:41,550
I’m in a lot of trouble

319
00:26:42,305 --> 00:26:47,125
he clearly promised to marry me

320
00:26:49,302 --> 00:26:50,169
Carelessly

321
00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:55,599
Carelessly?

322
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:00,373
I slept in

323
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,710
I was stupid.
I was tricked

324
00:27:10,179 --> 00:27:11,475
Yes you are

325
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:14,413
Very

326
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:23,788
I certainly introduced him to you

327
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,794
I feel responsible

328
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:35,849
I wanted you guys to have a clean relationship

329
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,584
How was it?

330
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:49,578
That's what I thought

331
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:07,084
I was surprised that you had sex with him

332
00:28:10,344 --> 00:28:13,532
He told me and I guessed what happen

333
00:28:15,939 --> 00:28:19,892
I think he is honest

334
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:26,939
He lied to you but he really likes you

335
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:29,765
So

336
00:28:32,781 --> 00:28:36,953
I heard that you received 20,000 yen from him.

337
00:28:38,555 --> 00:28:43,250
I refused but he gave me

338
00:28:45,584 --> 00:28:47,139
But you got it for sure

339
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,398
he thinks the money is settled

340
00:28:58,335 --> 00:29:04,023
He may think you slept with him for the money.

341
00:29:06,491 --> 00:29:08,624
You're so mean

342
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,770
Don't be loud

343
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:19,223
Listen,this is very important

344
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:27,956
You got the money, so if anything happens, it will be pursued.

345
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:31,387
he might say he bought you with money

346
00:29:33,691 --> 00:29:35,074
It can't be helped

347
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,340
What if everyone know

348
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,105
police may also be involved

349
00:29:43,988 --> 00:29:53,158
You know prostitution is a crime, right?

350
00:29:57,268 --> 00:30:01,151
Our business is also getting a bad reputation.

351
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,971
they might say we're a brothel

352
00:30:10,152 --> 00:30:14,839
I will lose everything

353
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:17,699
I'm sorry

354
00:30:21,958 --> 00:30:25,919
don't apologize to me

355
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,271
you were just deceived

356
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:36,211
there are bad people in the world

357
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:42,047
Bad women use agents like this to make money

358
00:30:43,797 --> 00:30:45,422
It can't be helped

359
00:30:49,049 --> 00:30:52,572
Have you seen Asako?

360
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:59,228
men watch her

361
00:30:59,918 --> 00:31:00,958
men watch her?

362
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,096
Yes, I asked him to watch her

363
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:16,441
It can be said that protection

364
00:31:16,949 --> 00:31:23,620
I'm afraid she will be escorted by the police

365
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:30,990
I have to take responsibility for that

366
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:36,925
I'm watching her so she doesn't do bad things

367
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:39,793
It can't be helped

368
00:31:40,582 --> 00:31:44,324
I would like to introduce her and receive a commission.

369
00:31:49,141 --> 00:31:51,282
I can protect you too

370
00:31:53,354 --> 00:31:55,283
I can ask someone to watch you

371
00:31:57,854 --> 00:32:03,010
That's good for us

372
00:32:20,036 --> 00:32:23,029
Where are you going?

373
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:26,333
You look down

374
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:30,255
come dance with us

375
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:33,224
I will introduce you to a good man

376
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,872
Let's go

377
00:32:37,378 --> 00:32:38,894
Let's have fun

378
00:32:39,714 --> 00:32:41,378
Where's Torii?

379
00:32:41,831 --> 00:32:45,878
I broke off my engagement with him

380
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:52,105
he has feminine and old values

381
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:56,753
There are many men who are better than him

382
00:32:57,387 --> 00:32:58,395
Let's go

383
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,576
Let's dance

384
00:33:28,608 --> 00:33:32,106
I wanna dance with you

385
00:33:32,779 --> 00:33:34,435
Let's have fun

386
00:33:35,505 --> 00:33:36,724
Leave me alone

387
00:33:38,032 --> 00:33:39,063
Lady

388
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:51,006
It's too noisy here, let's go outside

389
00:33:51,031 --> 00:33:52,006
Now?

390
00:33:52,977 --> 00:33:56,259
Let's go to a quiet place

391
00:33:57,399 --> 00:33:58,524
I'll go home

392
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,544
I'll go home

393
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,298
Get hands of me

394
00:34:09,323 --> 00:34:11,127
Stop it

395
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:14,744
What the hell?

396
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:23,140
Let's go

397
00:34:26,734 --> 00:34:27,695
Bye

398
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:31,540
OK

399
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,337
You are so drunk

400
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,565
Sorry

401
00:34:39,284 --> 00:34:40,667
Do you remember me?

402
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:46,784
This is Asako Yoshida, who worked with Tonobe

403
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:54,747
Did you get better?

404
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:01,180
she is your colleague?

405
00:35:01,938 --> 00:35:03,063
She's so bad

406
00:35:04,524 --> 00:35:07,665
Don't get discouraged if you fail once

407
00:35:08,126 --> 00:35:10,547
they are so terrible

408
00:35:12,188 --> 00:35:17,524
she says she's a virgin and gets married

409
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:26,080
If you want to play with her, you should earn money with the agent woman

410
00:35:29,701 --> 00:35:33,764
My friend own an apartment without being there for two years

411
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,389
You will be the owner of the building

412
00:35:41,067 --> 00:35:42,348
I'm not kidding

413
00:35:44,864 --> 00:35:49,184
she expects from you

414
00:35:51,674 --> 00:35:53,807
she is very business person

415
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:57,846
Don't tell her

416
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,690
I heard that you had two arranged dates.

417
00:36:04,237 --> 00:36:08,167
Do you know two of them?

418
00:36:10,729 --> 00:36:14,815
they are her bodyguards

419
00:36:15,401 --> 00:36:18,112
one of them looks like her husband

420
00:36:19,205 --> 00:36:22,260
she tested you

421
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:31,752
She said she didn't have the man you wanted, so she did it to make you give up.

422
00:36:34,315 --> 00:36:35,572
That's the life

423
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:39,371
you should be smart

424
00:36:42,113 --> 00:36:46,074
don't worry someone's watching you

425
00:36:47,207 --> 00:36:51,519
If you work with her, you may find a good man.

426
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,433
She says she'll match make as soon as she has a good story

427
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:03,680
That's good, isn't that?

428
00:37:19,442 --> 00:37:21,614
Was Shimako-san laughing too?

429
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:27,043
she's so simple.
Did you tell her?

430
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,190
I told her that Miyako built an apartment.

431
00:37:30,457 --> 00:37:35,645
did you play well about me?

432
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:36,723
That's bad

433
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:40,285
I told her something

434
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:44,262
I wish she knew about me

435
00:37:45,387 --> 00:37:51,043
I'm not a yakuza so I don't want to do bad things

436
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:57,417
I hope she can earn money doing what she likes

437
00:37:59,557 --> 00:38:04,018
Life is good even if you don't get married I will tell her

438
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,807
I know she wants men

439
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:12,127
she lost her virginity at 30

440
00:38:13,283 --> 00:38:17,377
When I get married, I plan to be your father as well.

441
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:21,096
He really loves you

442
00:38:22,127 --> 00:38:24,947
you are really stupid

443
00:38:26,088 --> 00:38:28,213
I broke off my engagement

444
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:34,682
You'd rather run an apartment and make money

445
00:38:36,746 --> 00:38:40,050
I was worried because you didn't get out of the bath

446
00:38:40,457 --> 00:38:41,371
I'll go out now

447
00:38:48,702 --> 00:38:51,624
Oh Hidaka.
When did you come?

448
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,928
Oh I see

449
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:59,756
are you the person before?

450
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:09,528
She doesn't seem to go to work these days

451
00:39:11,036 --> 00:39:17,396
I will contact her and get back to you.

452
00:39:21,364 --> 00:39:27,880
I gave you a hard time and I want you to be happy

453
00:39:28,441 --> 00:39:32,207
Do you have any problems if you quit your company and use your retirement allowance?

454
00:39:32,863 --> 00:39:35,339
I'll work again later

455
00:39:37,446 --> 00:39:38,821
You want me to marry,right?

456
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:42,586
You need money to get married

457
00:39:43,032 --> 00:39:46,813
I will not marry a man for my money

458
00:39:46,993 --> 00:39:52,391
But it is rude to marry without money.

459
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:58,429
I can talk to my grandfather, who is rich, and we will be fine.

460
00:39:59,179 --> 00:40:01,945
If I go to a marriage agency, I can make as many matches as I want

461
00:40:04,185 --> 00:40:09,989
I'm in a marriage agency so don't worry

462
00:40:10,649 --> 00:40:14,040
I hate marriage agencies

463
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:18,711
why do you hate?

464
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:24,485
The Tokyo Metropolitan Government and ward offices also operate marriage agencies.

465
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,219
your thoughts are old

466
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:28,602
you have express mail

467
00:40:31,594 --> 00:40:34,594
you are writing a letter of resignation

468
00:40:35,492 --> 00:40:37,852
Are you planning to play with your retirement money?

469
00:40:38,516 --> 00:40:41,516
Yes.
Let me see the mail

470
00:40:50,509 --> 00:40:55,001
I think she's in the mood

471
00:40:56,282 --> 00:41:02,947
She is so shocked that she doesn't want to see you for a while.

472
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,067
you'll be fine if you have a little patience

473
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:18,216
Women can't forget their first man

474
00:41:20,141 --> 00:41:21,469
Sure

475
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:27,930
you'll be fine if you have a little patience

476
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:33,003
You have a lot of matchmaking partners

477
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:40,388
that woman with big eyes?

478
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:48,210
I have to go to toilet

479
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,071
There is also a toilet inside

480
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:57,118
Shimako

481
00:42:00,165 --> 00:42:03,094
I thought I had the wrong person.

482
00:42:03,782 --> 00:42:06,954
are you on your way home?

483
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:14,648
shall we talk somewhere?

484
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:16,530
How about going to Atami?

485
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:18,382
how is your companion?

486
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:20,515
Did you see?

487
00:42:20,616 --> 00:42:22,694
Yes. I have to go

488
00:42:23,382 --> 00:42:24,866
Hold on

489
00:42:25,569 --> 00:42:28,679
I know how you feel

490
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,765
I have my own reasons.

491
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:36,163
I didn't mean to fool you

492
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:38,116
Get hands off of me

493
00:42:39,413 --> 00:42:40,734
Oh Tsurukawa

494
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,820
Takabayashi

495
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:44,007
I was looking for you

496
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,779
you had a very hard time

497
00:42:54,944 --> 00:42:57,889
No way.
You helped me

498
00:42:58,029 --> 00:43:02,295
I was so surprised that you helped me

499
00:43:02,553 --> 00:43:03,428
Did you forget about me?

500
00:43:03,576 --> 00:43:10,560
No no.
I was happy that you from OGOSHI department found me

501
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,498
I am very honored.
It worked well

502
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:20,779
It's the second time I've been surprised by you

503
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:28,089
I saw you occasionally at the company, but I was very surprised about you at  Kadota's wedding.

504
00:43:28,585 --> 00:43:31,264
you were so beautiful

505
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:33,217
About my clothes,right?

506
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,428
Yes

507
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,069
Yes but

508
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:42,913
You were a beauty that matched that dress

509
00:43:43,694 --> 00:43:47,006
Today you yourself are so beautiful

510
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:53,280
you really are more beautiful than before

511
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,621
I was surprised by that

512
00:43:57,942 --> 00:43:58,973
where are you going?

513
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:03,958
wherever you like is fine

514
00:44:06,407 --> 00:44:09,821
OK. so Let's go somewhere with me

515
00:44:11,548 --> 00:44:14,696
I'm starving

516
00:44:16,294 --> 00:44:17,637
What should I do

517
00:44:18,075 --> 00:44:19,114
Do you feel annoying?

518
00:44:19,301 --> 00:44:23,762
I'm shy.
I'm starving too

519
00:44:26,099 --> 00:44:30,068
I thought you left the company to get married

520
00:44:31,763 --> 00:44:35,599
I meant to that.
but I do nothing but doing matchmaking

521
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,231
do you come to atami for that?

522
00:44:39,325 --> 00:44:41,638
It would be nice to have a date in Atami

523
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:44,591
he gives you diamonds

524
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:49,427
It would be nice if so.
But It doesn’t work well

525
00:44:50,926 --> 00:44:53,270
You are very demanding of others

526
00:44:53,707 --> 00:44:56,457
I always get rejected by men

527
00:44:57,082 --> 00:45:02,621
Men don't realize how beautiful you are

528
00:45:08,269 --> 00:45:12,761
are you not going to get married yet?

529
00:45:13,105 --> 00:45:16,972
I am not popular with women at all

530
00:45:17,355 --> 00:45:20,370
I hear you are popular with women

531
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:23,863
I have a bad reputation

532
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:28,129
To be honest, I'm very weak

533
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,054
I have a problem

534
00:45:34,086 --> 00:45:39,289
We just met, but I have a request for you.

535
00:45:41,088 --> 00:45:41,689
For what?

536
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:44,010
can you be my fiancee?

537
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:47,853
Just for the time being

538
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:53,932
you want to run away from a woman?

539
00:45:54,416 --> 00:45:55,221
That's right

540
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:59,127
I think she will run away if she sees you

541
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:02,166
Please help me

542
00:46:07,289 --> 00:46:08,727
Oops

543
00:46:10,282 --> 00:46:13,407
It's strange to play with you

544
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:39,296
You are dancing very good

545
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:41,729
don't you drink?

546
00:46:41,955 --> 00:46:45,705
I’m already drunk

547
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:48,104
I'll have another one

548
00:46:52,529 --> 00:46:53,897
Welcome

549
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:58,740
It's been a long time since I met you

550
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,779
is this your first time here?

551
00:47:03,139 --> 00:47:05,779
she is very beautiful

552
00:47:05,930 --> 00:47:08,743
I thought you were a geisha

553
00:47:08,906 --> 00:47:10,766
I really admire you

554
00:47:11,438 --> 00:47:14,837
she is going to be my wife

555
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,946
I brought her here to educate her.

556
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:21,118
That's what I thought

557
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:32,370
she is too beautiful for you.
you should keep her in the alcove

558
00:47:37,301 --> 00:47:38,223
when is the wedding?

559
00:47:38,684 --> 00:47:40,340
End of march

560
00:47:40,598 --> 00:47:45,114
it's nice to do it in the spring.
where are you going on your honeymoon?

561
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:51,364
Of course we will go to Kyoto your shop is nearby

562
00:47:53,958 --> 00:47:57,380
Please visit us

563
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,315
Kyoto in spring is very beautiful

564
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:09,739
please drink more

565
00:48:09,817 --> 00:48:13,021
I know you drink a lot

566
00:48:13,247 --> 00:48:15,942
We are on our way back from Atami

567
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:20,911
You guys were in Atami even though you didn't have a wedding?

568
00:48:21,402 --> 00:48:24,348
Did you guys go to preview the honeymoon?

569
00:48:24,551 --> 00:48:26,551
I went for matchmaking

570
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:32,574
It's very old-fashioned to have a matchmaking

571
00:48:33,137 --> 00:48:34,973
You are very old-fashioned

572
00:48:35,137 --> 00:48:38,676
It can't be helped

573
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:46,059
If I don't take her home, I will get angry from your family.

574
00:48:56,396 --> 00:49:00,997
He has a lot of things going on with me.

575
00:49:08,914 --> 00:49:14,242
Why are you grinning?

576
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,461
Whatever.
I may be drunk

577
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,375
I feel so pleasant

578
00:49:21,586 --> 00:49:24,679
you came home late

579
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:28,898
you worry me

580
00:49:29,304 --> 00:49:30,039
did you eat dinner?

581
00:49:30,453 --> 00:49:32,539
I had

582
00:49:32,718 --> 00:49:34,414
with your friend?

583
00:49:34,898 --> 00:49:36,921
With nice person

584
00:49:37,406 --> 00:49:41,929
Was there a wonderful person at the class reunion?

585
00:49:42,672 --> 00:49:45,430
I didn't go to the class reunion

586
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:49,032
I met him at Tokyo Station on my way home.

587
00:49:49,336 --> 00:49:52,680
Who?
If you don't eat, I will clean up the meal

588
00:49:52,711 --> 00:49:53,915
Go ahead

589
00:49:56,628 --> 00:50:02,409
I also told you about Mr. Takabayashi of OGOSHI department store.

590
00:50:02,854 --> 00:50:03,628
Mr. Takabayashi ?

591
00:50:04,197 --> 00:50:10,742
He was the manager of a department store and was able to do business with our store from time to time.

592
00:50:11,969 --> 00:50:13,915
He also attended Ujiie's wedding

593
00:50:15,024 --> 00:50:16,258
He's playboy

594
00:50:17,141 --> 00:50:19,797
You stupid.
I go to bed

595
00:50:23,868 --> 00:50:29,516
She's turn to be crazy

596
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:33,204
Don't talk about her badly

597
00:50:33,727 --> 00:50:36,508
He's popular for play boy

598
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:38,164
You know him?

599
00:50:38,868 --> 00:50:39,782
I don't know

600
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:44,664
Shimako told me.
He's so play boy in the company too

601
00:50:45,344 --> 00:50:46,250
You sure?

602
00:50:46,993 --> 00:50:50,399
She told you about him too

603
00:50:51,211 --> 00:50:54,133
Why she has something to do with him?

604
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,453
She knows that,right?

605
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:03,102
a woman's heart is hard to understand

606
00:51:06,883 --> 00:51:08,305
a woman's heart is hard to understand?

607
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:11,055
You're too noisy.
I can't sleep

608
00:51:12,507 --> 00:51:14,203
You'll get cold

609
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,531
All men are don Juan or wolf

610
00:51:21,476 --> 00:51:22,327
I wanna eat fried noodle

611
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:23,281
Me too

612
00:51:24,187 --> 00:51:28,546
What the hell.
Shimako wanna eat too?

613
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:33,835
She won't eat.
She mast have eaten beef steak with him

614
00:51:34,507 --> 00:51:36,992
Department store chiefs don't get paid much.

615
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:39,882
But he's business man

616
00:51:41,507 --> 00:51:43,156
It costs a lot to play with women

617
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:47,335
He is cheating on the deal money.

618
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,148
Don't think too much

619
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:52,070
He's not thief

620
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:56,477
Women like strong men

621
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:00,899
What's wrong?

622
00:52:06,983 --> 00:52:09,178
Where are you guys going for honeymoon?

623
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:13,522
That's good place to go

624
00:52:13,717 --> 00:52:16,826
It's lovely in the spring

625
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:26,214
I'm going on a business trip to Asian Textile in Hamamatsu, so why don't we meet at a hotel in Hamanako?

626
00:52:27,151 --> 00:52:28,815
Are we going for honeymoon?

627
00:52:29,784 --> 00:52:31,292
It might be so

628
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:33,167
We can't?

629
00:52:34,971 --> 00:52:36,932
Why do you laugh?

630
00:52:38,018 --> 00:52:41,425
We are supposed to go to Kyoto for honeymoon,right?

631
00:52:41,573 --> 00:52:43,971
That's for real honeymoon

632
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:48,190
This will be fake honeymoon

633
00:52:49,659 --> 00:52:54,729
You are nice.
This is my business trip so I can't change the place

634
00:52:56,670 --> 00:52:59,357
I'm afraid to see my grandfather

635
00:52:59,474 --> 00:53:02,443
There is no chance.
You just stay at hotel

636
00:53:03,998 --> 00:53:06,216
Are you Mr.Takabayashi.
There's a phone call for you

637
00:53:15,668 --> 00:53:16,707
Oh Sensei

638
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:20,480
What the hell, Shimako

639
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,660
Who's he?

640
00:53:22,965 --> 00:53:27,941
I happened to meet my ex college

641
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:31,051
Are you having an affair?

642
00:53:31,246 --> 00:53:32,261
No way

643
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:39,511
It is against the rules to date men for free.

644
00:53:42,187 --> 00:53:43,132
Excuse me

645
00:53:47,187 --> 00:53:50,367
How did you find I was here?

646
00:53:52,109 --> 00:53:54,960
So What can I do for you?

647
00:53:55,820 --> 00:54:01,179
Well, what should I do.
I ask you to pay the unbilled money

648
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:03,118
Or ask you to arrange our date

649
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,376
Oh about unbilled money

650
00:54:05,603 --> 00:54:08,634
I know you wanna ask me to wait

651
00:54:11,046 --> 00:54:12,015
Ask me for date

652
00:54:12,507 --> 00:54:13,960
Anytime is fine

653
00:54:14,991 --> 00:54:16,984
Who the hell the girl

654
00:54:17,531 --> 00:54:21,124
You are open minded

655
00:54:24,463 --> 00:54:29,611
Can you forgive about Hidaka?

656
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:37,157
He's here, Atami.
He can meet you anytime

657
00:54:39,916 --> 00:54:42,775
You can play with him

658
00:54:43,174 --> 00:54:45,525
I know you want me to go

659
00:54:46,564 --> 00:54:52,041
I know everything what are you doing!

660
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:53,853
Trust me

661
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:59,119
I know how you trick women

662
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:08,189
I won't leave from you even if you get married

663
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:09,775
You get it?

664
00:55:10,103 --> 00:55:12,353
Cut it out, Madam

665
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:13,268
Leave me alone

666
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,502
You are too noisy

667
00:55:15,588 --> 00:55:18,666
You should give up

668
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:23,530
Hello?

669
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:26,849
He hang up?

670
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:30,303
You deserve it

671
00:55:30,389 --> 00:55:32,686
You seduce him

672
00:55:43,792 --> 00:55:44,589
Shimako

673
00:55:53,002 --> 00:55:54,065
Good luck

674
00:55:54,401 --> 00:55:57,034
Leave it to me.
You too

675
00:55:57,534 --> 00:55:58,666
You idiot

676
00:56:42,864 --> 00:56:44,216
To Jotokai

677
00:56:57,903 --> 00:57:03,082
Can we trade only half of the items?

678
00:57:04,286 --> 00:57:09,450
We are in trouble with our business.

679
00:57:10,317 --> 00:57:11,622
I see

680
00:57:11,825 --> 00:57:14,669
Possibly even a criminal case.

681
00:57:15,692 --> 00:57:21,879
I was rehired by Asian Textiles on the verge of bankruptcy and I don't want to cause problems.

682
00:57:21,974 --> 00:57:24,927
I get it.
It was bad timing

683
00:57:26,278 --> 00:57:29,505
We don't care if we lose 3 million yen

684
00:57:29,638 --> 00:57:33,340
I also talked your boss

685
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:38,349
He told me that he gave some rebate money

686
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:41,864
So this is no problem

687
00:57:43,153 --> 00:57:49,356
2,300,000 yen as a breach of contract fee can be paid as expenses.

688
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:53,138
Thank for your advice.
Thieves will steal again, won't they?

689
00:57:54,552 --> 00:58:00,332
In short, I'm thief.
You can't forgive thief

690
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:04,519
I'll be over

691
00:58:07,144 --> 00:58:08,855
Shall we run away to Hong Kong together?

692
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:11,816
I did nothing wrong

693
00:58:13,152 --> 00:58:14,332
I'm kidding

694
00:58:40,570 --> 00:58:41,890
Shimako

695
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,425
Shimako

696
00:58:53,402 --> 00:58:56,112
I'm too bad

697
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,492
Sorry I was something wrong

698
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,539
I couldn't hold back

699
00:59:08,322 --> 00:59:09,314
I love you

700
00:59:09,525 --> 00:59:11,463
I'm not good enough for you

701
00:59:12,338 --> 00:59:13,260
I'm too bad

702
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:16,142
Never mind

703
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:17,799
I'm bad too

704
00:59:19,666 --> 00:59:23,346
I'm really too bad

705
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:28,064
Don't say anything.
I'm bad too

706
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:32,853
I'm not the woman who you think of

707
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:36,877
I've played with many men

708
00:59:37,236 --> 00:59:41,283
It doesn't matter I am play boy

709
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,424
This is a different matter.

710
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:49,947
I have punched a hole in the ledger of $3 million.

711
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:56,800
A client company was absorbed by an Asian textile company.

712
00:59:57,777 --> 01:00:03,644
If the transactions had continued, the bookkeeping irregularities would not have been discovered.

713
01:00:03,951 --> 01:00:05,279
I thought I worked out

714
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:10,818
no one will protect me

715
01:00:11,685 --> 01:00:15,576
Of course I will be fired from the company

716
01:00:16,037 --> 01:00:20,826
He may file criminal charges against me if I don't make money in the next few days.

717
01:00:21,794 --> 01:00:23,974
I might be in a jail

718
01:00:33,425 --> 01:00:36,479
I'll make up the money

719
01:00:41,737 --> 01:00:47,088
If we paid only half, he might have settled out of court.

720
01:00:47,745 --> 01:00:54,284
I can't ask you to do that

721
01:00:54,844 --> 01:00:55,837
Why?

722
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:58,110
Why?

723
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:06,993
It's a joke that I'm in jail

724
01:01:07,911 --> 01:01:11,856
this is just business failure

725
01:01:12,388 --> 01:01:14,895
this is very common

726
01:01:18,646 --> 01:01:20,099
Forget what I said

727
01:01:21,146 --> 01:01:24,739
Don't be serious.
Let's have fun

728
01:01:25,663 --> 01:01:27,194
I was sorry

729
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:29,483
Forget what I said

730
01:01:33,864 --> 01:01:36,739
It's a very nice lake

731
01:01:37,348 --> 01:01:38,739
I want to ride a boat

732
01:01:41,273 --> 01:01:42,859
Let's go now

733
01:01:42,976 --> 01:01:45,968
It's too late

734
01:01:46,742 --> 01:01:48,195
It's still bright

735
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:06,573
Damn it

736
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:12,096
No...

737
01:02:13,089 --> 01:02:17,096
don't worry so much about money

738
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:22,163
You're very kind,Shimako

739
01:02:23,436 --> 01:02:26,624
I never sucked my mom's tits

740
01:02:28,163 --> 01:02:30,140
You're like my mom

741
01:02:31,194 --> 01:02:34,288
you are my only friend

742
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:36,265
I can't trust anyone

743
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:38,366
I can't trust anyone

744
01:02:39,514 --> 01:02:42,795
I only need you

745
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:47,858
I don't care if I die

746
01:03:11,115 --> 01:03:13,537
I don't care if I die

747
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:18,138
let us die together

748
01:03:41,554 --> 01:03:45,195
We're not over yet

749
01:03:48,242 --> 01:03:48,969
Shimako

750
01:04:12,437 --> 01:04:13,273
I'm going out

751
01:04:17,523 --> 01:04:19,758
I'm going out.
What's wrong?

752
01:04:20,685 --> 01:04:23,654
Have a seat,Shimako

753
01:04:23,935 --> 01:04:25,716
I need to talk with you

754
01:04:25,912 --> 01:04:27,005
What's wrong?

755
01:04:28,134 --> 01:04:28,877
You are strange

756
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:41,077
What's wrong?
You are strange

757
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:43,522
we are worried about you

758
01:04:43,608 --> 01:04:44,311
For what?

759
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,264
I will tell you the truth

760
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:50,233
You're lying

761
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:52,397
What the hell?

762
01:04:55,441 --> 01:04:57,996
This is from Mikiko

763
01:04:58,168 --> 01:05:00,277
Yes from Kyushu

764
01:05:01,285 --> 01:05:08,651
You went to Mikiko's place in Hamamatsu, didn't you?

765
01:05:12,675 --> 01:05:14,035
I went to hamamatsu

766
01:05:14,308 --> 01:05:15,550
But she said...

767
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:19,644
She wasn't in Hamamatsu because she was traveling.

768
01:05:21,144 --> 01:05:23,175
I will tell you the truth

769
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,698
I didn't go to Hamamatsu to see her.

770
01:05:28,784 --> 01:05:29,612
That's what I thought

771
01:05:29,705 --> 01:05:33,697
I decided to get married with Takabayashi

772
01:05:34,393 --> 01:05:36,174
What the hell?

773
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,998
I thought you would like it

774
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:40,928
I finally found my partner

775
01:05:41,342 --> 01:05:43,545
But he is...

776
01:05:43,570 --> 01:05:45,334
I went to Hamamatsu with him

777
01:05:46,428 --> 01:05:47,842
you are not pure

778
01:05:48,233 --> 01:05:51,827
your thoughts are old

779
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:57,935
I know he has a bad reputation

780
01:05:58,200 --> 01:06:02,724
I don't care if he's a playboy

781
01:06:03,379 --> 01:06:05,035
It's not big deal

782
01:06:06,535 --> 01:06:10,707
no one believes I’m not married yet

783
01:06:11,927 --> 01:06:12,919
That's the life

784
01:06:14,779 --> 01:06:17,286
I think he and I get along very well

785
01:06:17,927 --> 01:06:21,255
I want you to take my words seriously.

786
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:23,367
I don't mean that

787
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:28,125
I'm serious. so I went to Hamamatsu

788
01:06:29,058 --> 01:06:32,761
I wanted to get along with him well

789
01:06:34,589 --> 01:06:42,633
I'm serious.
Marriage counseling was meaningless

790
01:06:45,564 --> 01:06:52,666
You didn't help me when you worried about me

791
01:06:54,304 --> 01:06:55,367
So I'm right

792
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,054
I feel sad to hear that

793
01:07:00,992 --> 01:07:04,132
I gave you a lot of trouble

794
01:07:04,987 --> 01:07:08,565
I feel bad about it

795
01:07:10,495 --> 01:07:12,011
Mitsuko and Takeshi too

796
01:07:12,036 --> 01:07:13,940
I know how you feel

797
01:07:14,667 --> 01:07:17,917
Get married and I'm just leaving this house

798
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:19,167
Shimako

799
01:07:21,675 --> 01:07:25,214
This is a happy occasion, so don't cry.

800
01:07:28,192 --> 01:07:29,254
Excuse me

801
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:32,465
Who's there?

802
01:07:38,474 --> 01:07:41,959
Congratulations. Ok

803
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:45,584
I don't care who you marry

804
01:07:47,217 --> 01:07:50,990
I can do a background check on him

805
01:07:51,287 --> 01:07:53,131
This is a marriage agency

806
01:07:53,857 --> 01:07:55,084
No way

807
01:07:56,986 --> 01:08:00,462
you still don't understand

808
01:08:04,897 --> 01:08:13,031
You say marriage marriage without worrying about a matchmaking partner

809
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:18,524
He's upset.
can you take responsibility?

810
01:08:21,716 --> 01:08:23,060
it was not possible to stay outside

811
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:26,943
A day trip from Atami was possible

812
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:31,429
I know you used Asako

813
01:08:35,464 --> 01:08:37,721
You had an affair in Hamamatsu

814
01:08:39,487 --> 01:08:40,565
I was not

815
01:08:41,620 --> 01:08:46,885
you didn't meet the matchmaking partner

816
01:08:47,796 --> 01:08:49,944
You had an affair with a man

817
01:08:51,507 --> 01:08:56,007
Our business is very trustworthy.
I can't stand your behavior

818
01:09:01,785 --> 01:09:06,043
You are much more educated than Asako

819
01:09:06,965 --> 01:09:11,261
I won't give you much explanation

820
01:09:13,011 --> 01:09:15,667
It's not good to have an affair with a man

821
01:09:17,519 --> 01:09:19,144
you know the rules?

822
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,410
Do you know what will happen if you break the rule?

823
01:09:30,553 --> 01:09:33,827
I'm sorry I'll be careful from now on

824
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:36,538
I won't be fooled by you

825
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,780
we take business seriously

826
01:09:43,079 --> 01:09:46,811
we are credit first

827
01:09:49,983 --> 01:09:51,999
Ok anyway

828
01:09:53,525 --> 01:09:59,431
you will be punished for breaking the rules

829
01:10:02,277 --> 01:10:03,995
You’re scary

830
01:10:05,214 --> 01:10:08,347
What the hell you are?

831
01:10:09,269 --> 01:10:10,644
It's not so you

832
01:10:12,285 --> 01:10:15,207
you have sinned a lot

833
01:10:16,539 --> 01:10:20,242
you were playing with a 50 year old man

834
01:10:21,992 --> 01:10:23,085
crying can't solve the problem

835
01:10:24,539 --> 01:10:25,289
Hey guys

836
01:10:43,874 --> 01:10:45,523
don't be so surprised

837
01:10:46,531 --> 01:10:48,718
We won't attack you

838
01:10:49,755 --> 01:10:52,919
We're not Yakuza

839
01:10:55,637 --> 01:10:57,551
You should listen to us

840
01:10:58,724 --> 01:10:59,552
Go with him

841
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:01,591
I have nothing

842
01:11:01,616 --> 01:11:03,177
Follow him

843
01:11:04,839 --> 01:11:10,855
just follow him and work

844
01:11:12,151 --> 01:11:14,299
You'll get paid

845
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:17,354
you don't have to worry

846
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:19,299
Let's go

847
01:11:20,301 --> 01:11:27,481
I will forgive you when you have successfully completed your work.

848
01:11:46,494 --> 01:11:50,197
I'm very sorry that it didn't work out

849
01:11:52,839 --> 01:11:54,909
it's my responsibility

850
01:11:56,573 --> 01:11:59,503
Thank you

851
01:12:02,668 --> 01:12:03,504
Yes

852
01:12:09,177 --> 01:12:10,388
Yes

853
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:15,833
we won't bother you

854
01:12:17,219 --> 01:12:21,281
so don't worry

855
01:12:27,549 --> 01:12:29,284
Thank you

856
01:12:42,207 --> 01:12:46,262
she is waiting for you in the drawing room

857
01:13:14,109 --> 01:13:15,453
Come in

858
01:13:19,367 --> 01:13:21,640
nice to meet you

859
01:13:21,845 --> 01:13:24,064
have a seat

860
01:13:24,478 --> 01:13:25,798
Do not be shy

861
01:13:37,572 --> 01:13:41,947
you are very beautiful.
You're Shimako,right?

862
01:13:46,354 --> 01:13:49,276
Please make yourself at home

863
01:13:50,378 --> 01:13:56,573
what should I do tonight?

864
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:06,642
Tonobe told me that I should just put up with it for one night.

865
01:14:09,447 --> 01:14:17,074
If I tell you what will happen in advance, many people will quit.

866
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:40,863
the flowers are blooming so beautifully.
Have you eaten dinner yet?

867
01:14:42,348 --> 01:14:46,825
Please prepare a meal for two

868
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:49,098
Sure

869
01:14:50,759 --> 01:14:56,274
You eat differently than she does.

870
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,213
last time I failed

871
01:15:00,931 --> 01:15:03,713
I think it's better not to tell her in advance this time

872
01:15:04,111 --> 01:15:07,275
I get it.
I'll do that

873
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:14,673
I tell you

874
01:15:16,837 --> 01:15:19,946
this is really embarrassing

875
01:15:23,911 --> 01:15:26,974
my husband is already dead

876
01:15:28,036 --> 01:15:33,185
I live here with my son Akihiko.

877
01:15:35,213 --> 01:15:40,025
When he was a child, he was a very quiet and intelligent child.

878
01:15:41,557 --> 01:15:47,064
He got lost in the mountains when he was in high school.

879
01:15:48,236 --> 01:15:51,385
he was rescued three days later

880
01:15:52,557 --> 01:15:55,502
he went crazy

881
01:15:58,715 --> 01:16:02,559
These days he seems very crap

882
01:16:05,442 --> 01:16:10,942
But his body wants girl

883
01:16:12,775 --> 01:16:16,212
he seems frustrated

884
01:16:18,525 --> 01:16:24,173
he attacks me sometimes

885
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,495
Other than that, I want to fulfill his wishes.

886
01:16:30,354 --> 01:16:32,917
But I can't handle this

887
01:16:34,097 --> 01:16:37,175
I've been thinking a lot

888
01:16:37,948 --> 01:16:40,042
But It didn't work out

889
01:16:41,953 --> 01:16:47,304
I want to ask you this

890
01:16:48,976 --> 01:16:53,344
Please sleep with him tonight

891
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:02,594
Please listen to her

892
01:17:03,344 --> 01:17:06,048
Please listen to her

893
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:28,726
You were surprised when I asked you this?

894
01:17:30,675 --> 01:17:33,339
you thought this was very dirty?

895
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:36,589
It can't be helped

896
01:17:40,542 --> 01:17:46,612
Tonobe used to be a nurse and I met her there.

897
01:17:46,917 --> 01:17:54,153
I sometimes ask her staff

898
01:17:56,114 --> 01:17:59,317
I've never met a beautiful woman like you

899
01:18:00,763 --> 01:18:05,560
I really feel ashamed to ask you for this

900
01:18:07,361 --> 01:18:10,400
I think your parents will be surprised to know this.

901
01:18:12,518 --> 01:18:15,025
I feel sorry for that

902
01:18:20,351 --> 01:18:27,555
I don't care if you refuse this job

903
01:18:30,634 --> 01:18:32,915
Are you hungry?

904
01:18:33,892 --> 01:18:36,454
Let's have meal

905
01:18:46,219 --> 01:18:47,805
Please start

906
01:18:48,985 --> 01:18:50,016
I hope you like it

907
01:18:54,422 --> 01:18:56,516
don't think anything

908
01:18:58,172 --> 01:18:59,375
Please start

909
01:19:02,063 --> 01:19:05,657
I'll do it

910
01:19:08,258 --> 01:19:11,649
I will meet your request

911
01:19:13,758 --> 01:19:15,321
Are you sure?

912
01:19:37,307 --> 01:19:40,377
there is another house

913
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,323
bathroom is there

914
01:20:41,549 --> 01:20:43,518
Your pajama is here

915
01:20:45,018 --> 01:20:51,875
He will come around 9 o'clock, so please talk to him normally.

916
01:20:53,415 --> 01:20:56,196
He is sometime very shy

917
01:20:57,282 --> 01:21:00,501
Thank you in advance

918
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:56,012
Thank you for your hard work.
Akihiro was there?

919
01:21:56,090 --> 01:22:02,246
He was in my room so I told him to wait in the bedroom.

920
01:22:06,712 --> 01:22:14,196
I am very grateful to her

921
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:23,959
Mom

922
01:23:29,239 --> 01:23:29,552
Mom

923
01:23:31,427 --> 01:23:31,966
Yes

924
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,427
your mother is not here

925
01:23:36,114 --> 01:23:39,458
this is my mother's room

926
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:43,817
I saw her.
Please get ready

927
01:23:47,917 --> 01:23:51,589
I see.
Hold on

928
01:25:02,026 --> 01:25:02,721
Are you ready?

929
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:06,182
I'm ready

930
01:25:10,248 --> 01:25:11,920
Why she is not here?

931
01:25:25,798 --> 01:25:30,142
do you hate doing it here?

932
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:35,567
Come in

933
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:48,137
thank you for coming Mom

934
01:25:50,027 --> 01:25:51,832
I'm not your mom

935
01:25:51,918 --> 01:25:54,621
don't lie to me

936
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:59,809
she's made a fake of herself here before

937
01:26:00,645 --> 01:26:05,942
I know the difference between real and fake.
I punished the fake

938
01:26:10,777 --> 01:26:14,199
she was the devil

939
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:16,675
it's terrible

940
01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:26,261
The devil wants me to stay in this room and never see anyone

941
01:26:29,956 --> 01:26:36,924
You love me, but you're the devil's command, and I'm imprisoned here

942
01:26:38,964 --> 01:26:40,917
I really hate it

943
01:26:42,066 --> 01:26:46,245
I want to kill my mother and eat her body

944
01:26:51,170 --> 01:26:53,990
are you scared of me?

945
01:26:56,767 --> 01:26:59,626
I'm not

946
01:27:01,673 --> 01:27:05,822
Ok then I'll kiss you

947
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:19,915
Is that enough?

948
01:27:24,314 --> 01:27:25,252
Akihiro

949
01:27:34,333 --> 01:27:35,599
it's very quiet

950
01:27:36,497 --> 01:27:38,372
looks like it's going well

951
01:27:39,122 --> 01:27:40,654
I hope so

952
01:27:41,036 --> 01:27:43,255
They are ok

953
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,089
I'll take a bath with you and wash you

954
01:28:01,065 --> 01:28:02,909
I wash you

955
01:28:05,627 --> 01:28:08,049
I hate taking a bath

956
01:28:10,963 --> 01:28:14,291
Can I suck your boobs?

957
01:28:20,964 --> 01:28:21,940
Go ahead

958
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:57,241
he thinks I’m his mother and He treated me nice last night

959
01:30:00,177 --> 01:30:06,662
I have the opportunity to meet many men through this kind of work.

960
01:30:08,650 --> 01:30:14,377
But this is the first time I've slept with a man with pure feelings.

961
01:30:16,721 --> 01:30:24,026
I was sad to leave him this morning

962
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:30,574
I really appreciate you

963
01:30:32,137 --> 01:30:38,676
It is very unusual that he was able to make contact with women quietly.

964
01:30:40,133 --> 01:30:45,734
he was always rough with women

965
01:30:47,063 --> 01:30:50,118
I really appreciate you

966
01:30:50,376 --> 01:30:58,657
do you think his illness will be cured?

967
01:31:00,098 --> 01:31:04,848
You are the first to express such hope.

968
01:31:07,132 --> 01:31:07,859
Madam

969
01:31:11,304 --> 01:31:15,507
I gave TONOBE-san a thank you note for you.

970
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:23,551
This is the tip for you

971
01:31:24,829 --> 01:31:26,391
Please take this

972
01:31:29,485 --> 01:31:35,047
Takabayashi,
This jade hairpin is said to cost 500,000 yen.

973
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:37,313
I will sell this soon

974
01:31:38,711 --> 01:31:46,445
If you combine that with my retirement allowance, it will be close to 3 million yen.

975
01:31:47,868 --> 01:31:49,961
I think they will be happy with that

976
01:31:51,774 --> 01:31:58,242
they won't sue you and you will be saved

977
01:32:13,396 --> 01:32:15,451
Do you want to meet Mr. Takabayashi?

978
01:32:16,044 --> 01:32:17,146
Is he here?

979
01:32:17,419 --> 01:32:19,458
Oh you don't know about it.
Come with me

980
01:32:23,437 --> 01:32:27,625
We had a hard time.
he died

981
01:32:29,844 --> 01:32:34,789
he died.
We're in trouble

982
01:32:35,992 --> 01:32:40,610
Don't go in because the police are still there.

983
01:32:45,442 --> 01:32:50,567
Police said that he committed suicide with a hostess in Ginza

984
01:32:51,481 --> 01:32:57,864
I think she killed him

985
01:32:58,343 --> 01:33:03,194
I think an autopsy on the corpse will reveal the results.

986
01:33:04,677 --> 01:33:06,223
I think he was poisoned by her

987
01:33:12,635 --> 01:33:13,854
She's his girlfriend

988
01:33:13,909 --> 01:33:15,378
I feel sorry

989
01:33:35,855 --> 01:33:40,378
she will soon feel better

990
01:33:41,065 --> 01:33:45,425
She doesn't have any worries about aftereffects and there is no problem.

991
01:33:45,784 --> 01:33:48,347
Thank you very much

992
01:33:48,495 --> 01:33:51,230
Please let me know if she feels pain

993
01:33:57,894 --> 01:33:58,652
Police is here

994
01:33:59,769 --> 01:34:00,543
Police?

995
01:34:03,314 --> 01:34:03,970
Come in

996
01:34:11,758 --> 01:34:17,203
I have something I want to ask her when she leaves the hospital.

997
01:34:19,477 --> 01:34:20,352
Are you her mom?

998
01:34:21,493 --> 01:34:23,360
Do you know about name of Tonobe Riki?

999
01:34:25,680 --> 01:34:28,118
I will ask her about it

1000
01:34:28,281 --> 01:34:29,515
Take care

1001
01:34:33,925 --> 01:34:35,276
Tonobe Riki?

1002
01:34:36,190 --> 01:34:37,698
Female?

1003
01:34:39,575 --> 01:34:41,099
Takabayashi...

1004
01:34:41,317 --> 01:34:44,685
That person has nothing to do with him

1005
01:34:45,247 --> 01:34:48,778
The marriage agency she runs has been exposed.

1006
01:34:50,122 --> 01:34:51,458
Read this

1007
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:58,739
Asako Yoshida reportedly informed

1008
01:34:58,981 --> 01:35:04,216
She once came to our house to invite Shimako

1009
01:35:06,603 --> 01:35:09,509
I just remember

1010
01:35:16,809 --> 01:35:17,731
Mom

1011
01:35:19,622 --> 01:35:20,434
Do you feel pain?

1012
01:35:23,088 --> 01:35:26,353
you take a good rest

1013
01:35:26,869 --> 01:35:29,634
The doctor says you can leave the hospital soon.

1014
01:35:30,019 --> 01:35:31,745
I'm glad it wasn't a big problem.

1015
01:35:32,456 --> 01:35:34,667
sorry for worrying you guys

1016
01:35:35,269 --> 01:35:37,722
It can't be helped because this is a traffic accident

1017
01:35:40,220 --> 01:35:42,337
I should be more careful

1018
01:35:43,157 --> 01:35:50,254
I laugh at my stupidity

1019
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,184
I feel sorry for him

1020
01:35:55,575 --> 01:35:57,747
you don't have to feel sorry for him

1021
01:36:01,079 --> 01:36:03,345
I feel sorry for Kyoko who died

1022
01:36:04,571 --> 01:36:06,337
she was going to marry him

1023
01:36:06,759 --> 01:36:07,868
That's ridiculous

1024
01:36:10,650 --> 01:36:14,790
I should have been hit by a truck and died

1025
01:36:15,455 --> 01:36:21,119
I think you still have a chance of getting married

1026
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:26,483
After you leave the hospital, please relax in the hot springs.

1027
01:36:29,750 --> 01:36:32,039
I wanna see Mikiko

1028
01:36:32,064 --> 01:36:35,461
I think it's good over there because the air is good.

1029
01:36:36,283 --> 01:36:39,001
I thank you

1030
01:36:40,517 --> 01:36:42,704
I haven't done anything to you

1031
01:36:45,688 --> 01:36:50,251
you took such good care of us

1032
01:36:50,466 --> 01:36:51,880
give me my handbag

1033
01:36:52,411 --> 01:36:53,450
Here it is

1034
01:36:54,513 --> 01:36:55,622
Open it

1035
01:36:57,513 --> 01:36:59,372
The wrapped item is inside.

1036
01:36:59,950 --> 01:37:00,685
This?

1037
01:37:06,380 --> 01:37:08,411
This is a very expensive hairpin.

1038
01:37:08,911 --> 01:37:11,364
This doesn't suit me, so I'll give it to you

1039
01:37:11,778 --> 01:37:14,583
this looks very expensive

1040
01:37:17,036 --> 01:37:18,630
If I sell this, it will be worth 500,000 yen.

1041
01:37:19,427 --> 01:37:20,591
500,000 yen?

1042
01:37:24,407 --> 01:37:25,056
Sis

1043
01:37:41,795 --> 01:37:42,826
Are you going home?

1044
01:37:43,131 --> 01:37:43,990
I was surprised

1045
01:37:44,170 --> 01:37:44,951
you didn't care about your surroundings

1046
01:37:46,325 --> 01:37:47,178
Police visited her?

1047
01:37:47,623 --> 01:37:48,490
How did you know?

1048
01:37:48,787 --> 01:37:49,787
the receptionist told me

1049
01:37:50,473 --> 01:37:57,457
It seems that Takabayashi was using the company's money illegally.

1050
01:37:58,163 --> 01:38:02,694
I am glad she did not marry him.

1051
01:38:03,491 --> 01:38:04,014
How's her?

1052
01:38:04,413 --> 01:38:05,249
She'll be fine

1053
01:38:05,577 --> 01:38:06,256
That's good

1054
01:38:07,452 --> 01:38:08,655
I'll see her

1055
01:38:09,295 --> 01:38:09,694
do you go to school?

1056
01:38:10,249 --> 01:38:11,780
I don't go to school

1057
01:38:24,436 --> 01:38:27,686
Mitsuko looks upset

1058
01:38:28,288 --> 01:38:29,600
She told me to quit school

1059
01:38:32,132 --> 01:38:35,115
I hope you too quit college and become a pimp.

1060
01:38:46,375 --> 01:38:48,649
Mom,I was wrong

1061
01:38:50,235 --> 01:38:54,273
Please forgive what I did

1062
01:38:56,211 --> 01:39:01,242
I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused Mitsuko and Takeshi.

1063
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:07,266
I won't give you trouble anymore

1064
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:17,648
I like this lake since I've seen this first time

1065
01:39:19,230 --> 01:39:28,753
I decided to commit suicide at this lovely lake.
No one around me.

1066
01:39:30,644 --> 01:39:34,035
I found what was love first time when I was at 30yrs old

1067
01:39:34,386 --> 01:39:38,175
I'll feel it at the bottom of this lake

1068
01:39:38,652 --> 01:39:40,472
Furukawa!

1069
01:39:43,870 --> 01:39:45,144
I'm here

1070
01:39:49,566 --> 01:39:51,175
You'd a hard time

1071
01:39:55,472 --> 01:39:59,113
You ended up coming here

1072
01:39:59,870 --> 01:40:01,308
Here's good place

1073
01:40:05,191 --> 01:40:08,769
Yeah, here's memorable place

1074
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:09,831
Stop talking about it

1075
01:40:11,097 --> 01:40:12,027
That's too much

1076
01:40:13,417 --> 01:40:14,941
I don't mean that

1077
01:40:17,363 --> 01:40:21,831
You've left what you have done to this lake

1078
01:40:24,120 --> 01:40:26,605
Here's the place where you start your new life

1079
01:40:28,449 --> 01:40:30,660
You were born here

1080
01:40:31,964 --> 01:40:33,136
Sorry but I read this

1081
01:40:35,441 --> 01:40:40,073
This wasn't pasted.
You don't need this

1082
01:40:47,831 --> 01:40:52,292
Ok, wanna come to my home?

1083
01:40:54,394 --> 01:40:55,628
You need some rest

1084
01:41:19,838 --> 01:41:20,947
You guys

1085
01:41:23,885 --> 01:41:24,486
Furukawa!

1086
01:41:25,635 --> 01:41:26,682
It's been a while

1087
01:41:28,260 --> 01:41:29,268
It's been a while

1088
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,369
You know her?

1089
01:41:33,502 --> 01:41:34,627
Yes I know

1090
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,814
So we don't need to introduce her

1091
01:41:37,518 --> 01:41:39,018
You're cheeky

1092
01:41:40,361 --> 01:41:42,712
You guys know her?

1093
01:41:42,908 --> 01:41:45,322
We are introduced about her by aunt

1094
01:41:46,893 --> 01:41:48,322
I'll take care of your bag

1095
01:41:49,087 --> 01:41:52,087
You want something from me?

1096
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:53,072
Hold on

1097
01:41:54,486 --> 01:41:55,947
I don't have any souvenirs in my bag.

1098
01:41:56,244 --> 01:41:56,963
It's OK

1099
01:41:59,455 --> 01:42:01,494
I hear you were on business trip in Tokyo

1100
01:42:03,768 --> 01:42:07,564
I went your home on the way

1101
01:42:09,549 --> 01:42:12,674
I worry how you are after you left the company

1102
01:42:14,471 --> 01:42:15,822
Did you see my mom?

1103
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:26,220
It's a long way around, but let's see the dunes first.

1104
01:42:40,272 --> 01:42:42,873
Great view, isn't it?

1105
01:42:43,717 --> 01:42:44,483
So nice

1106
01:42:45,014 --> 01:42:46,381
I'll show you more

1107
01:42:48,303 --> 01:42:51,444
I'll show you around later if you like

1108
01:42:52,811 --> 01:42:56,951
You only know the surface of the lake

1109
01:43:00,303 --> 01:43:02,405
Life is hard

1110
01:43:04,287 --> 01:43:06,037
there's no end to what you can do if you care enough

1111
01:43:08,436 --> 01:43:10,811
Not only you but I do

1112
01:43:12,873 --> 01:43:14,866
I hear your wife passed away

1113
01:43:18,326 --> 01:43:22,256
She was sick and stayed at hospital all the way

1114
01:43:23,858 --> 01:43:25,897
She doesn't need to feel pain anymore

1115
01:43:26,803 --> 01:43:27,717
You are terrible

1116
01:43:29,241 --> 01:43:29,998
Really

1117
01:43:31,467 --> 01:43:34,912
It was hard for me to look at her.

1118
01:43:36,139 --> 01:43:37,233
I'm sorry

1119
01:43:38,858 --> 01:43:40,428
Forget about this story

1120
01:43:43,084 --> 01:43:45,530
Good things will come to you

1121
01:43:47,983 --> 01:43:49,670
Life and view are same

1122
01:43:50,897 --> 01:43:52,436
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.

1123
01:43:54,506 --> 01:43:58,865
Don't be discouraged. Cheer up.

1124
01:44:02,897 --> 01:44:03,655
They two are a good match.

1125
01:44:04,030 --> 01:44:04,889
Of course

1126
01:44:05,530 --> 01:44:08,451
You two are a good match.

1127
01:44:11,405 --> 01:44:12,451
What?

1128
01:44:13,655 --> 01:44:16,857
You two are a good match.

1129
01:44:17,561 --> 01:44:18,444
Finish?

1130
01:44:19,756 --> 01:44:20,670
What the hell?

1131
01:44:23,233 --> 01:44:28,357
We're not finished yet

1132
01:44:37,475 --> 01:44:46,326
THE END

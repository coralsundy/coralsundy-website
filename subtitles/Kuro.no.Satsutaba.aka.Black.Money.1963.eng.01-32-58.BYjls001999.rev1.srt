2
00:00:14,845 --> 00:00:24,093
Black bundles of money

3
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:22,507
Managing Director's Office

4
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,211
Even for me

5
00:01:25,672 --> 00:01:27,109
To you, General Affairs Manager.

6
00:01:27,523 --> 00:01:31,891
I don't ask about the business status of our Asia Processing Company

7
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,156
The president, we are

8
00:01:34,654 --> 00:01:40,654
We came on board to fundamentally improve the situation of the business, which is losing money the more you sell

9
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,497
We will do whatever it takes

10
00:01:42,889 --> 00:01:46,428
We must thoroughly improve this company's structure

11
00:01:47,881 --> 00:01:51,732
For the time being,Externally,
we do not pay dividends on our stock

12
00:01:52,146 --> 00:01:55,584
We do things like shelve our bank debt

13
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,639
Internally, we are trying to streamline management

14
00:01:59,014 --> 00:02:03,529
We're going to restructure some of your section chiefs

15
00:02:04,748 --> 00:02:06,240
Chief's been talking to him for a long time

16
00:02:06,654 --> 00:02:06,959
Yes

17
00:02:07,474 --> 00:02:09,295
How many Chiefs have been called?

18
00:02:09,889 --> 00:02:11,904
Three heads of sales management

19
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:14,037
Looks like there are 16 Chiefs in our division

20
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:16,334
So 19 people in total?

21
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,756
The restructuring has begun

22
00:02:17,795 --> 00:02:19,224
Will we ordinary employees also be restructured?

23
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:20,435
I think so

24
00:02:21,162 --> 00:02:25,834
Those who want to get ahead through the power of academic cliques should be careful

25
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,896
It seems that all the department heads that were called in graduate from S university

26
00:02:31,256 --> 00:02:34,787
It means These are the former president's henchmen

27
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,826
Speaking of S university,our Chief also graduated from S university,right?

28
00:02:36,967 --> 00:02:37,771
Yes he is

29
00:02:37,982 --> 00:02:42,670
so After five years with the company, he surpassed Mr. Ishida, who was two years his senior, to become a section chief

30
00:03:04,951 --> 00:03:05,560
See you

31
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:06,482
Good night

32
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:11,474
Welcome to our store

33
00:03:13,474 --> 00:03:16,271
I'm sorry I'm late

34
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:17,592
Can you pass me the hand towel?

35
00:03:17,617 --> 00:03:18,146
Yes

36
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,209
I'm starving

37
00:03:20,662 --> 00:03:21,873
Oh, You're just drinking?

38
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:23,615
Shall we eat something?

39
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:25,748
May I help you?

40
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,286
One serving of pork cutlet, please

41
00:03:28,325 --> 00:03:28,810
Yes

42
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:29,639
One beer

43
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:30,178
Yes

44
00:03:32,131 --> 00:03:33,920
You don't drink anything but beers

45
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:38,240
Did you have a bad day at the office?

46
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:40,701
What happen if I resign from the company ?

47
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,396
I have never thought about that

48
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,545
I don't want to be a husband with no economic power

49
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:48,592
What are you talking about?

50
00:03:49,326 --> 00:03:51,389
Oh I just remembered, Excuse me

51
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,553
I'll have a pork cutlet sandwich to go, please

52
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:58,857
You have not eaten the pork cutlet sandwich yet

53
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:01,506
You can eat it

54
00:04:05,717 --> 00:04:07,420
You have not had a dinner yet,right?

55
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:11,771
What's wrong with you?

56
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:14,943
It's bad you drink a lot

57
00:04:16,068 --> 00:04:17,592
Here it is.
This is Yummy

58
00:04:17,717 --> 00:04:18,849
I don't feel like eating

59
00:04:20,881 --> 00:04:24,451
I think you has something wrong at company

60
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,482
Please tell me

61
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,318
Nothing wrong

62
00:04:29,748 --> 00:04:32,592
You just told me you resign from the company or something..

63
00:04:32,724 --> 00:04:35,389
You are too noisy.
I've told you nothing wrong!

64
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,021
I'm sorry

65
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,881
I won't ask you anything

66
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:47,951
But We promised not to hide things from each other

67
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,974
Please keep the promise

68
00:04:56,646 --> 00:04:59,326
Sorry... I'm something wrong today

69
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,498
Oh..It's too late so I have to leave now

70
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:04,357
There's still the last train

71
00:05:04,396 --> 00:05:04,857
Yes

72
00:05:06,192 --> 00:05:07,614
You should take a rest too

73
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:08,005
Um

74
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,818
Be careful of having a cold

75
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:10,240
I know

76
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,146
A total of 84 people at the head office and plants are being restructured

77
00:05:19,466 --> 00:05:21,232
84 people is 40% of the total factory.

78
00:05:21,841 --> 00:05:23,373
Next, it's the employees' turn

79
00:05:23,724 --> 00:05:25,623
If so, our union will complain

80
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:28,654
It's just an employment union.
It won't work

81
00:05:29,754 --> 00:05:31,645
By the way,What will happen to chief’s company housing?

82
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:35,308
They said they'd sell it to him for 70% of the market value.

83
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,809
He can't afford to double his severance pay

84
00:05:36,863 --> 00:05:38,035
That's too bad

85
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:39,848
They told him if he didn't like it, he should get out of his house.

86
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:41,238
That's ridiculous

87
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:42,840
This is the fate of businessmen

88
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:45,957
Today you, tomorrow me

89
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,176
Chief,There is a visitor

90
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:48,981
Thank you

91
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,652
Shinpei Miyagawa

92
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:53,965
Please take one

93
00:05:54,168 --> 00:05:54,645
Thank you

94
00:05:55,785 --> 00:05:58,715
You are the section chief

95
00:05:58,903 --> 00:06:01,301
So I should have given you jobs because we are old friend

96
00:06:03,254 --> 00:06:05,535
It was too late to see me

97
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:08,395
I might be fired soon

98
00:06:08,488 --> 00:06:09,184
You are kidding

99
00:06:11,574 --> 00:06:13,371
You remind me of something

100
00:06:14,512 --> 00:06:17,332
How about Sumie Higuchi, who used to be in the secretarial section?

101
00:06:17,442 --> 00:06:18,449
She is fine

102
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,019
She does bar business in Tsukishima

103
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:21,356
Oh I see

104
00:06:22,012 --> 00:06:23,973
I thought she got married

105
00:06:24,153 --> 00:06:26,535
It's a beautiful bar in that area

106
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,168
I see

107
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:29,442
She must have found a good patron

108
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:31,567
It might be so

109
00:06:32,012 --> 00:06:33,567
You have good memory

110
00:06:34,082 --> 00:06:34,653
About her

111
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,192
I won't forget her

112
00:06:36,973 --> 00:06:40,863
Shortly after joining the company I made a printing mistake.
She helped me out

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,684
Oh yeah, I remember that

114
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:51,262
By the way,Hiyama-san

115
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:54,473
I know it's been a while since we've seen each other, but it's hard to say...

116
00:06:55,785 --> 00:06:58,332
Can I borrow 1000 or 2000 yen from you?

117
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,199
Well...I lost a bet on a horse race

118
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,535
I'm running out of money as opposed to earning an allowance

119
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:10,910
Have you always liked horse racing?

120
00:07:11,207 --> 00:07:12,262
I like it

121
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:13,871
Here it is

122
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,598
Thank you very much

123
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:16,949
I'll return you soon

124
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:18,457
Where do you live?

125
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:20,410
Don't worry.
You can see me whenever you are free

126
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,238
I see

127
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:22,817
Thank you very much

128
00:07:38,621 --> 00:07:39,278
Yes

129
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:42,207
Oh you

130
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,168
No work today?

131
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:46,176
I was supposed to work but I have overtime every day so..

132
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,676
I'm so tired, got headache

133
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,481
Are you OK?

134
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:49,153
Yes

135
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:50,840
You should take a rest

136
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:51,981
Thank you

137
00:07:52,285 --> 00:07:54,121
There is a blanket in closet

138
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:54,590
Thanks

139
00:07:55,113 --> 00:07:56,043
Take care

140
00:07:56,637 --> 00:07:57,848
I'm going out

141
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,418
Take care of yourself

142
00:07:59,465 --> 00:07:59,910
Yes

143
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:04,082
There are some bread there.
You can eat if you are hungry

144
00:08:04,223 --> 00:08:04,481
Um

145
00:08:31,403 --> 00:08:33,160
Can you come over here,Hiyama?

146
00:08:38,176 --> 00:08:40,277
It's awful that you transferred me without even asking me what I wanted

147
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,606
If you don't like it, it's company policy to let you leave the company

148
00:08:44,113 --> 00:08:45,379
You mean you want me to leave this company?

149
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,434
If you refuse the transfer, there is no way to ask you leave this company

150
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:50,512
You idiot!

151
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:54,231
Stop it!

152
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:56,004
Let me go!

153
00:08:58,817 --> 00:09:00,293
I will leave this company!

154
00:09:07,326 --> 00:09:08,686
I will leave this company!

155
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,912
Mmmmm...

156
00:09:25,092 --> 00:09:26,139
Kashiwagi-san?

157
00:09:28,272 --> 00:09:29,116
Kashiwagi-san?

158
00:09:29,217 --> 00:09:29,944
Mmmm

159
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:32,053
Kashiwagi-san?

160
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:33,959
Yes

161
00:09:39,741 --> 00:09:40,225
Hi!

162
00:09:41,991 --> 00:09:42,741
Are you kashiwagi-san?

163
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:43,561
Yes

164
00:09:43,881 --> 00:09:47,616
Well..This resident list lists only one person, Eiko Kashiwagi

165
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:49,998
What kind of relationship do you have with her?

166
00:09:53,091 --> 00:09:53,708
Your name?

167
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,241
Kenji Hiyama

168
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:56,241
Address?

169
00:09:56,514 --> 00:09:57,030
Address?

170
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,553
The police won't check your family register now.

171
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,475
You ask me my name and address.
What you will do then?

172
00:10:01,655 --> 00:10:03,264
This is not checking your family register

173
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:04,849
Information network in the jurisdiction...

174
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:06,170
I am not shady

175
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:07,787
I'm not a thief

176
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:08,811
No No do not misunderstand me

177
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,280
Then I understand.
Excuse me

178
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:16,998
How dare you

179
00:10:19,646 --> 00:10:20,545
Ah...

180
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:23,701
Awww

181
00:10:25,178 --> 00:10:26,326
Do not disturb me

182
00:10:26,686 --> 00:10:27,451
Who's there?

183
00:10:27,756 --> 00:10:28,803
I'm Miyagawa

184
00:10:29,303 --> 00:10:30,100
Miyagawa?

185
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:34,771
Oh you

186
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:36,365
How did you know here?

187
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:40,537
Mr.Yoshida of your company told me you probably stay here

188
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:41,444
Yoshida said that?

189
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:41,998
Yes

190
00:10:43,084 --> 00:10:44,858
Can I come in?

191
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:46,116
Please

192
00:10:49,451 --> 00:10:50,537
Please take your seat

193
00:10:54,826 --> 00:10:56,467
What a nice room it is!

194
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,967
Is this the home of your future wife?

195
00:11:00,264 --> 00:11:01,459
Yoshida also said that?

196
00:11:01,725 --> 00:11:02,037
Ha?

197
00:11:04,162 --> 00:11:05,069
Please make yourself at home

198
00:11:06,943 --> 00:11:07,764
Why you have visited me?

199
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,966
Thank you for the other day

200
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,889
I'm sorry I don't have a envelop for the money

201
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,084
You didn't have to come all this way

202
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:17,443
Thanks

203
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:18,826
Ah wait!

204
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,975
You don't have to check the bill?

205
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:21,717
What?

206
00:11:22,685 --> 00:11:24,334
There are just two bills so I don't need to check

207
00:11:24,857 --> 00:11:27,209
Have you noticed anything different?

208
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,193
I have not noticed anything different

209
00:11:30,404 --> 00:11:31,951
Can you compare with other 1000yen bill?

210
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:32,974
What?

211
00:11:48,131 --> 00:11:49,631
You haven't noticed yet?

212
00:11:49,982 --> 00:11:52,553
There is a difference from the other 1000yen bill

213
00:11:59,553 --> 00:12:00,701
There is no number!

214
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:03,115
What the hell is this?

215
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:05,998
A printing error at the mint?

216
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,100
No way!

217
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,412
A bill without numbers won't make it to the world

218
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:15,631
I'm sorry to have to say this but Nowadays, bills are made by the Printing Bureau, not the Mint.

219
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,271
You are right

220
00:12:18,411 --> 00:12:20,153
so Are these counterfeit bills?

221
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:22,185
Yes that's right

222
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,662
There's a watermark on the bill.

223
00:12:27,014 --> 00:12:28,490
It's easy to make it

224
00:12:28,842 --> 00:12:32,420
For example,If you put a half sheet of paper on top of the tempura

225
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,889
The oil soaks into it, making it look translucent

226
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:36,209
That's it

227
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:39,833
So..You made this

228
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:42,225
How is this?
It's hard to notice,isn't it?

229
00:12:43,021 --> 00:12:46,029
Making counterfeit money is a serious crime.

230
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:50,600
Making counterfeit money for use is punishable by life imprisonment or more than three years

231
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:55,232
Even if it's not intended for use, people don't think so

232
00:12:56,154 --> 00:12:58,560
What happen if someone report you a police?

233
00:12:58,717 --> 00:12:59,568
Don't worry

234
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:03,256
You are the only person I showed this

235
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:04,342
Only me?

236
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,607
What the hell is this?

237
00:13:10,053 --> 00:13:12,318
Actually,I need your wisdom

238
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:13,475
My wisdom?

239
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,443
I have a favor of you

240
00:13:17,592 --> 00:13:18,631
Can you?

241
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:21,404
So you made this for use?

242
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,334
I'll get back to you on that after you've consulted with me.

243
00:13:25,865 --> 00:13:26,716
How many bill have you made?

244
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,037
I will tell you later

245
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:32,889
But..it's hard to consult with you

246
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,131
I think I'm stuck.…

247
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:37,779
I didn't know you'd come to me for help with something like this

248
00:13:37,896 --> 00:13:42,146
I've given it some thought, and I've told you

249
00:13:46,818 --> 00:13:50,607
Call me when you've made up your mind

250
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:52,420
Please

251
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,951
Actually,I need your wisdom

252
00:14:12,193 --> 00:14:13,529
This is a consultation

253
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:17,404
Call me when you've made up your mind

254
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:24,373
Oh you forgot something

255
00:14:24,685 --> 00:14:25,459
Your cigarette

256
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:27,248
Thank you

257
00:14:38,256 --> 00:14:38,920
This guy

258
00:14:39,904 --> 00:14:42,396
I first met him at the race track.

259
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,935
He came to see me after a few days,then asked me for a drink

260
00:14:46,232 --> 00:14:47,498
I like drinking

261
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:50,295
I drunk with him 6 or 7 times since then

262
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:54,389
But He told me one night that he had a lucrative job for me

263
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,381
That job was making counterfeit paper money?

264
00:14:57,178 --> 00:14:59,678
Yes, he asked me to Print 10,000 bills with 1000 yen bill

265
00:15:00,014 --> 00:15:00,842
It means 10 million yen?

266
00:15:01,107 --> 00:15:02,365
Of course I refused it

267
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,584
I take pride in my printing work

268
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,842
It's easy to make counterfeit money

269
00:15:10,178 --> 00:15:13,623
I've always heard that making counterfeit money is not a worthwhile crime

270
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:19,686
But he said it's a crime if you make it yourself and use it yourself.

271
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:22,156
He said you just make it

272
00:15:22,804 --> 00:15:25,890
He said He will buy them at real 4 million yen if I make the fake 10 million yen bills

273
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:28,390
Then we cut off our ties

274
00:15:28,953 --> 00:15:31,085
He has nothing to do with the one who uses it

275
00:15:31,859 --> 00:15:35,898
He said you can get real 4 million yen

276
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:42,156
He did not use the counterfeit bills in Japan, but exchanged them for dollars in Hong Kong

277
00:15:43,906 --> 00:15:47,328
I heard that it is easy to exchange money from any country in Hong Kong!

278
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:56,937
I'll give up 4 million yen, but is there anyone who can take it back for 1 million yen?

279
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:02,140
I spent 700,000 yen to make this

280
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,335
You're talking to the wrong person

281
00:16:06,085 --> 00:16:08,070
I don't even have 1 million yen

282
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:13,953
In the first place, No one with a million dollars would do something so dangerous.

283
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,570
That's right, if you succeed, it'll be 10 million yen.

284
00:16:17,624 --> 00:16:19,406
You'll make ten times as much money.

285
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:21,695
This is a crappy theory

286
00:16:22,046 --> 00:16:24,421
It's a crime to use counterfeit money but

287
00:16:25,374 --> 00:16:27,117
No one else will be affected

288
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:30,187
If you steal or murder, there will always be victims

289
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:35,343
But even if you use counterfeit money, no one is personally harmed

290
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:41,781
If I had to choose,The governor of the Bank of Japan or the Japanese government.

291
00:16:43,562 --> 00:16:46,757
That makes you feel better about the same crime.

292
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:51,023
Did you really make this only by yourself?

293
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:54,007
Yes..why you ask me that?

294
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:59,413
I don't know the specifics, but can you make something that elaborate by yourself?

295
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:03,304
To be honest, there is another guy

296
00:17:03,796 --> 00:17:04,359
Who is he?

297
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:06,960
I promised him to not tell his name

298
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:12,218
I gave him a lot of money and let him make it.
Once it was finished, I cut ties.

299
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:13,913
Isn't he an ex-convict?

300
00:17:14,077 --> 00:17:15,070
Don't worry about that

301
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:16,546
What do you think,Hiyama-san?

302
00:17:18,046 --> 00:17:19,999
Do you have any good business ideas?

303
00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,632
Even if you use counterfeit money, no one is personally harmed

304
00:17:30,546 --> 00:17:34,804
If I had to choose,The governor of the Bank of Japan or the Japanese government.

305
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:36,382
Right?

306
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:41,851
if you succeed, it'll be 10 million yen.
You'll make ten times as much money.

307
00:17:44,406 --> 00:17:45,679
10 million yen..

308
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:50,210
Only 2.5 million yen in retirement benefits from a company I worked for 25 years.

309
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:53,812
I have 25 years until retirement.

310
00:17:54,445 --> 00:17:58,179
Even if I'm lucky and don't get laid off, I'll make 3 million at most

311
00:18:00,945 --> 00:18:03,593
If I had 10 million, the interest would be 700,000.

312
00:18:04,406 --> 00:18:06,781
Interest of more than 50,000 yen per month

313
00:18:08,007 --> 00:18:11,710
Eiko's dream comes true by opening a beauty salon with half of the 5 million yen.

314
00:18:13,046 --> 00:18:16,218
I can loan the remaining 5 million yen to the business.

315
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:22,734
Oh, what are you doing without turning on the light?

316
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,148
Don't you feel cold?

317
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,374
You know what,Kenji?

318
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,742
You told me just before you resign from your company

319
00:18:39,538 --> 00:18:41,640
I think it's better to resign

320
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,358
Why are you saying that all of a sudden?

321
00:18:43,765 --> 00:18:47,570
I talked to a lady at the store today who was obsessed with stocks.

322
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:51,382
She said your company's stock kept going down

323
00:18:54,765 --> 00:18:57,867
Your company's prospects are bleak

324
00:18:58,023 --> 00:18:58,874
You are right

325
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,320
I'm not so sure about my prospects at company either.

326
00:19:01,843 --> 00:19:03,593
So you should resign from your company

327
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:06,023
I want to say that to you but

328
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,671
There is not a better job

329
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,492
There is

330
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:12,281
Really?

331
00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:14,609
So there would be no problem

332
00:19:15,265 --> 00:19:18,484
I don't like salary man much

333
00:19:19,257 --> 00:19:21,617
But I need a money for the business

334
00:19:22,054 --> 00:19:23,593
Of course you need

335
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,124
About how much?

336
00:19:25,937 --> 00:19:27,234
It is about 1 million yen

337
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:29,179
Just 1 million yen?

338
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,257
I think 1 million yen is big money.
Do you have?

339
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:33,515
Of course I don't have

340
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,343
I've only got 200,000 saved up to open a beauty salon

341
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,788
so you shouldn't say just 1 million yen

342
00:19:40,132 --> 00:19:43,921
I thought you need 5 million yen at least for doing business

343
00:19:44,718 --> 00:19:46,226
So What kind of business?

344
00:19:46,468 --> 00:19:49,257
Mmmm.. someone told me..

345
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:52,460
I can make ten times as much in a couple of months if I'm successful

346
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:55,281
Ten times ? so 10 million?

347
00:19:55,843 --> 00:19:56,937
That 's a lot

348
00:19:57,335 --> 00:19:58,304
Yes true

349
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:01,265
I may never get another chance like this

350
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:02,695
500000 yen is not enough?

351
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:06,319
No.... I need 1 million yen at least

352
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:09,343
So you can start the business if you have 1 million yen

353
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:10,765
Forget about this talking

354
00:20:10,905 --> 00:20:12,296
Oh..Why?

355
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,280
It's just a dream anyway

356
00:20:14,694 --> 00:20:15,163
You sure?

357
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:17,163
You really think so?

358
00:20:17,304 --> 00:20:18,679
I can't help but think so

359
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,530
Never mind!
Never mind!

360
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:33,054
Thank you

361
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:39,265
I hear you have a lot of problems at work

362
00:20:39,577 --> 00:20:40,593
I'm making a last futile effort

363
00:20:40,937 --> 00:20:42,069
You talk about it like you are someone else

364
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,866
By the way What about that thing I asked you to do on the phone earlier?

365
00:20:45,335 --> 00:20:46,288
Are you going to Hong Kong?

366
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:48,843
I don't mean that.
I need to write a report

367
00:20:49,046 --> 00:20:50,968
In that case,Let's go get someone who knows what we're talking about

368
00:20:51,187 --> 00:20:54,304
Don't worry.
This is just small task

369
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:55,132
I see

370
00:20:56,077 --> 00:20:56,960
By the way

371
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,764
Is the Japanese yen accepted in Hong Kong?

372
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:00,733
Accepted?

373
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,233
Well..for example

374
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,483
You pay with Japanese yen when you take a taxi

375
00:21:08,593 --> 00:21:10,147
It does not mean they accept Japanese yen

376
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:13,421
But It is ok if you pay with Japanese yen at Hotels or Famous Jewelry Stores

377
00:21:14,249 --> 00:21:17,694
And moreover there are many money changers and banks in Hong Kong.

378
00:21:18,155 --> 00:21:20,194
You can exchange money there easily

379
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:22,788
In a way, the Japanese yen does work in Hong Kong.

380
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:26,624
How much Japanese yen is currently in circulation in Hong Kong?

381
00:21:26,741 --> 00:21:29,890
There is no reliable way to spend Japanese yen in Hong Kong.

382
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:33,343
But estimates are that it's between 100 and 150 million yen

383
00:21:33,624 --> 00:21:35,929
I see...between 100 and 150 million yen...

384
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:38,468
Well...Thank you very much

385
00:21:40,335 --> 00:21:43,413
What the hell with you?
You said it was urgent and to come here right away

386
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:49,148
Stop it.
I feel embarrassing

387
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:50,038
No no

388
00:21:50,882 --> 00:21:52,562
Look into my eyes

389
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:54,944
Don't look away

390
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:58,671
Do you really love me?

391
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,765
Tell me you like me or not

392
00:22:02,069 --> 00:22:02,452
You like me ?

393
00:22:03,452 --> 00:22:03,991
I like you

394
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:06,819
So You won't leave me

395
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:07,749
Of course

396
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:09,593
Why are you telling me this now?

397
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,584
Please take this

398
00:22:17,999 --> 00:22:18,515
What?

399
00:22:21,687 --> 00:22:22,249
What's this?

400
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,257
Well...I've borrowed money

401
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,382
If I remember correctly..This drawer's Kimie tokito...

402
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:29,112
Yes, our teacher

403
00:22:29,643 --> 00:22:32,065
So Did she lend you a million yen?

404
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:34,034
Yes. for 3 months

405
00:22:34,276 --> 00:22:34,956
for 3 months?

406
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:38,565
Yes, because You've been told that the money will grow tenfold in a few months

407
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:39,284
Any condition?

408
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,557
Nothing at all

409
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:44,073
We just need to pay back 1 million yen in the third month and we'll be fine.

410
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:46,057
Is it interest free?
Unbelievable.

411
00:22:46,409 --> 00:22:47,589
This is not lie

412
00:22:47,979 --> 00:22:51,495
You said you need 1 million yen, so I have borrowed

413
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:52,987
We will be fine

414
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,089
I've never imagined this

415
00:22:55,854 --> 00:22:57,722
Please do not upset

416
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:02,190
I have a hard time seeing you these days.

417
00:23:03,526 --> 00:23:06,440
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

418
00:23:08,322 --> 00:23:14,376
I think a woman is happiest when she is an ordinary wife.

419
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:16,189
I really think so

420
00:23:16,876 --> 00:23:17,759
Thank you

421
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,040
I want to marry with you as soon as possible

422
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:27,031


423
00:23:27,302 --> 00:23:29,718
I feel bad about letting you live halfway around the world.

424
00:23:30,818 --> 00:23:32,747
When I had a bad experience with Yoshida

425
00:23:33,497 --> 00:23:36,591
You told me a new life

426
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:40,982
If you hadn't gotten involved with me at that time,

427
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,825
you married the daughter of an executive...

428
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:49,224
I'm the one who ruined your life

429
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:54,450
So Don't say anything and
Please take this money

430
00:23:58,536 --> 00:24:01,505
That's a cool thing to say but I bet on you

431
00:24:01,544 --> 00:24:02,036
What?

432
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:03,115
Bet on me?

433
00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:03,802
Yes

434
00:24:04,497 --> 00:24:05,560
I believe in you

435
00:24:06,193 --> 00:24:07,700
I'm sure you will win!

436
00:24:09,011 --> 00:24:09,934
So good luck

437
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,005
Eiko!

438
00:24:19,044 --> 00:24:20,630
I'm sorry for keeping you wait

439
00:24:23,013 --> 00:24:25,857
In my house, I don't want to be seen

440
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:28,552
This restaurant is owned by Sumie Higuchi, right?

441
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,560
Yes

442
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,450
So her patron is...

443
00:24:33,294 --> 00:24:35,036
I wasn't trying to hide it

444
00:24:35,529 --> 00:24:38,122
I failed to mention that you imagined it

445
00:24:38,286 --> 00:24:39,661
Sumie knows about that?

446
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:40,357
Yes

447
00:24:40,888 --> 00:24:45,146
In fact, it was here that we first talked about this

448
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,669
As you may know,Sumie is a solid woman

449
00:24:49,302 --> 00:24:52,466
No one knows this story except for you and five other people.

450
00:24:53,044 --> 00:24:58,247
so Sumie told you to borrow 2,000 yen from me.

451
00:24:59,818 --> 00:25:03,232
She said You have good wisdom and help us

452
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:05,044
I was fooled

453
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:05,755
I'm sorry

454
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:11,593
I can't have you saying no to me here

455
00:25:11,618 --> 00:25:13,178
I wouldn't say no either

456
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:14,858
So Can you help me?

457
00:25:14,929 --> 00:25:15,897
I don't help you

458
00:25:16,632 --> 00:25:17,600
I want to deal with you

459
00:25:18,257 --> 00:25:22,085
Once the deal is done, I'll cut you loose.

460
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:24,069
Any conditions?

461
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:24,866
Two conditions

462
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:30,218
Handing over 1,000 counterfeit bills and the equipment necessary to print the numbers for 900,000 yen

463
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:31,991
900,000 yen?

464
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,179
If any of the three of us, including Sumie, were to be arrested

465
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:37,733
Don't mention other people's names

466
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:39,780
I agree with you on the second one

467
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,561
But 900,000 yen...

468
00:25:41,586 --> 00:25:43,405
The only money I have available is one million yen

469
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:47,296
I need at least 100,000 yen for expenses to convert to 10 million yen.

470
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:48,601
It might be so but

471
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:52,007
I've actually spent 700,000 yen for it

472
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,499
So Can I borrow 100,000yen?

473
00:25:53,913 --> 00:25:56,483
I will return it half year later.
Is that fine with you?

474
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:03,764
It's been a long time,Hiyama-san

475
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:06,085
You look great, Higuchi-san

476
00:26:06,124 --> 00:26:07,436
I'm too old

477
00:26:07,461 --> 00:26:08,601
You are beautiful

478
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:09,733
You flatter me!

479
00:26:10,624 --> 00:26:11,976
Did he agree with us?

480
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:12,851
Not yet

481
00:26:13,499 --> 00:26:15,765
He found out about the plot where I went to borrow 2,000 yen.

482
00:26:16,226 --> 00:26:17,882
I shouldn't have invited him here

483
00:26:18,054 --> 00:26:21,944
No problem.
He'll figure it out later anyway

484
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,421
Is that right,Hiyama-san?

485
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:32,397
You said there were five people who know this, but there were four, right?

486
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,116
Oh..well...

487
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:36,819
There is no person who called Junzo Kochi

488
00:26:38,585 --> 00:26:39,733
That's what I thought

489
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:44,655
You're the one who came up with the idea for Koch-san, aren't you?

490
00:26:47,257 --> 00:26:48,546
You've been completely exposed.

491
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,796
I have no choice but to accept your conditions.

492
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:52,437
Do you have the money with you?

493
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:53,351
I've prepared

494
00:26:53,475 --> 00:26:55,123
I will give you the exactly amount

495
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,382
This is the printer

496
00:27:23,233 --> 00:27:25,608
2000 days using 5 bills per day each.

497
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,312
It takes 5 years and half if I spend all

498
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:29,804
About 3 years half days using 10 bills per day each.

499
00:27:30,718 --> 00:27:34,023
No...Eiko's debt is only due in three months.

500
00:27:35,312 --> 00:27:37,983
Redeeming counterfeit money in a short period of time is the first requirement for safety

501
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,757
I'll need a partner to do this work.

502
00:27:42,796 --> 00:27:44,608
I'll need a partner I can trust to do this work.

503
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:09,045
Here is your tea

504
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:09,757
Thank you

505
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:10,749
Here it is

506
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,273
I'll take care of it

507
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,718
There's a lot of dust.

508
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:18,077
It's hard to come in windy day

509
00:28:18,102 --> 00:28:19,562
You seem to be busy

510
00:28:19,593 --> 00:28:20,187
Make yourself at home

511
00:28:20,212 --> 00:28:20,835
Thanks

512
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:39,273
Let's celebrate with Mr. Ishiwatari!

513
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:43,569
Sorry Sorry

514
00:28:43,741 --> 00:28:44,983
I worked until 6pm

515
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,773
What? Are you salary man now?

516
00:28:46,991 --> 00:28:48,553
The world has changed

517
00:28:49,593 --> 00:28:50,304
Your seat is here

518
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:50,952
Ah

519
00:28:52,694 --> 00:28:53,819
It's been a long time

520
00:28:54,108 --> 00:28:55,335
Anyway have a drink

521
00:28:56,835 --> 00:28:58,538
I'm glad everyone is here

522
00:28:58,788 --> 00:29:00,061
Everyone was waiting for you

523
00:29:03,398 --> 00:29:04,444
So How are you?

524
00:29:04,757 --> 00:29:06,046
No bad

525
00:29:07,835 --> 00:29:09,350
I hear you work at a company.
where is it?

526
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:12,398
It's not big company.
It's Ekidanjo(fortuneteller)

527
00:29:13,148 --> 00:29:14,819
Ekidanjo(fortuneteller)?
What is that?

528
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:16,233
This

529
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:17,405
No way!

530
00:29:18,249 --> 00:29:19,507
I'm not kidding

531
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:23,452
You'll know if you come.
It's easy to find if you check the address

532
00:29:23,616 --> 00:29:24,694
Are you the fortuneteller?

533
00:29:24,913 --> 00:29:26,382
I'm still learning it

534
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,093
I can't believe it!

535
00:29:28,366 --> 00:29:30,796
What kind of fortune teller is a man who was in the student movement?

536
00:29:31,905 --> 00:29:32,608
It's not big deal

537
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:34,429
Anyway listen to me

538
00:29:35,335 --> 00:29:38,960
I've always rebelled against authority.

539
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:43,358
I've been fighting it since I graduated from college.

540
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:48,616
After all, every world is a bureaucracy.

541
00:29:51,733 --> 00:29:56,913
I felt it was pointless to fight the powers that be head on.

542
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,577
I began to miss innocent humans

543
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:04,491
I just happened to walk by there and decided to take this job.

544
00:30:06,577 --> 00:30:07,491
My feeling was right

545
00:30:08,452 --> 00:30:10,218
The people who come there are innocent.

546
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:13,929
At least They're more human than people in here

547
00:30:14,124 --> 00:30:15,921
You talk too bad

548
00:30:16,163 --> 00:30:17,702
What do you do there?

549
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,538
If you go to a university hospital, they'll give you a psychiatric diagnosis.

550
00:30:20,874 --> 00:30:21,421
That's it

551
00:30:22,468 --> 00:30:25,554
Ask the customer their name, date of birth, and what they want to have read

552
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,179
Make a dater to a fortune teller

553
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,460
To be honest,It's not a job I would recommend

554
00:30:32,006 --> 00:30:32,983
That's so you

555
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:34,108
Let's have a drink

556
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:37,256
You are smart as it is

557
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:38,366
Don't flatter me.

558
00:30:40,429 --> 00:30:42,210
I'll read your fortune later

559
00:30:43,022 --> 00:30:46,171
You can be an executive or you can be fired.

560
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:46,936
Hey Saito

561
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,546
Maybe I should see a fortune teller

562
00:31:03,944 --> 00:31:04,608
I understand

563
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,577
The first visit fee is 3000 yen

564
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:09,186
You can't see me today?

565
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,256
He will be available 5 days later

566
00:31:12,155 --> 00:31:13,546
Please visit us 3pm on Friday

567
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,046
If you will be late, you should wait 5 days later again

568
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,311
Yes, Thank you very much

569
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,147
Thank you very much too

570
00:31:26,194 --> 00:31:27,999
Oh, You are here as I thought

571
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,233
You're doing better than I thought

572
00:31:33,077 --> 00:31:35,116
Fortune telling is like a new religion

573
00:31:35,624 --> 00:31:38,171
False stage sets and god-awful speech.

574
00:31:38,788 --> 00:31:40,999
High fees make it a popular business.

575
00:31:42,858 --> 00:31:44,186
By the way why you visited me?

576
00:31:45,108 --> 00:31:46,436
You're here to tell your fortune?

577
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,538
Something like that

578
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:48,600
What do you mean?

579
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,257
Actually I'm thinking a business.
I met you last night...

580
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:52,827
Yeah

581
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:55,350
So you want to see my fortune-telling skills?

582
00:31:55,444 --> 00:31:55,975
Kind of

583
00:31:56,929 --> 00:31:58,319
Is the business difficult?

584
00:31:58,452 --> 00:31:59,671
Ah?..Kind of

585
00:32:02,163 --> 00:32:05,530
I'll be out of work in an hour, so just wait for me at my house.

586
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:05,921
OK

587
00:32:06,936 --> 00:32:10,857
My house is a small apartment.
I'm drawing a map now.

588
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:36,021
Who are you?

589
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:38,686
I am a classmate of Ishiwatari

590
00:32:39,232 --> 00:32:40,584
He told me to wait here

591
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:43,654
I see. He should have called me

592
00:32:44,201 --> 00:32:45,068
Please come in

593
00:32:49,318 --> 00:32:50,490
Please take your seat

594
00:32:53,186 --> 00:32:56,193
This is Yamaguchi of Moreno cosmetic company

595
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:58,490
He just showed me the cosmetic

596
00:32:58,537 --> 00:32:59,318
Pleased to meet you

597
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,373
Please enjoy!

598
00:33:03,412 --> 00:33:04,107
See you

599
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:04,646
Bye

600
00:33:08,092 --> 00:33:09,287
Please take your seat

601
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:09,639
Thank you

602
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:13,436
I'm sorry for the mess

603
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,138
Excuse me for a moment.

604
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,482
Wait!

605
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:42,420
I have to leave now.
He has picked up me, I can save taxi fee

606
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,061
Please look after our house

607
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,420
There is a hot water in the pot

608
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:00,850
It"s good to go to Izu

609
00:34:00,895 --> 00:34:05,201
It's quiet, it's glamorous, and you can have a beer at night

610
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,380
I like sea side.
Let's go together

611
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:09,990
But your husband will know

612
00:34:10,053 --> 00:34:11,428
Do not care about him

613
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:29,756
This is well done

614
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:31,052
I have 10,000 bills

615
00:34:31,506 --> 00:34:32,162
10,000 bills

616
00:34:32,764 --> 00:34:33,396
10 million yen?

617
00:34:33,537 --> 00:34:33,811
Yes

618
00:34:34,865 --> 00:34:36,670
But Counterfeit money is not profitable.

619
00:34:36,936 --> 00:34:39,131
Because it is not reasonable to create and use.

620
00:34:40,107 --> 00:34:43,686
You will succeed if you use this counterfeit money well.

621
00:34:45,904 --> 00:34:49,748
This is the history of counterfeit money since the Meiji era and its newspaper articles

622
00:34:50,818 --> 00:34:51,389
Where did you search this?

623
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,311
At library

624
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:55,818
I see.
You're the kind of person who takes things slowly and carefully.

625
00:34:58,232 --> 00:34:59,061
What is this table?

626
00:34:59,584 --> 00:35:02,225
I've sorted the bills into denominations, years of issue, and number of issues.

627
00:35:02,693 --> 00:35:04,725
I've ordered the bills by security, efficiency, and Fineness of work

628
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,029
efficiency?

629
00:35:06,209 --> 00:35:07,631
I will explain it

630
00:35:08,014 --> 00:35:11,123
The problem is, What amount of bills can be effectively counterfeited

631
00:35:12,115 --> 00:35:14,482
If you use a 100 yen bill, it's only worth 1,000 yen when you spend it.

632
00:35:14,881 --> 00:35:16,107
A 1000 yen bill is worth 1000 yen if you use one.

633
00:35:16,951 --> 00:35:19,701
In short,A 10,000 yen bill is the most efficient

634
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:23,240
Safety is the degree to which you are least likely to be discovered.

635
00:35:23,506 --> 00:35:28,295
Based on the number of bills in circulation and the amount of money, 100 yen bills are the safest.

636
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:29,896
Fineness of work?

637
00:35:30,412 --> 00:35:33,521
The newer the year of publication, the better.so 10000yen bill

638
00:35:33,857 --> 00:35:34,693
But in a sense

639
00:35:35,006 --> 00:35:39,646
In general,The older the year of issue, the easier it is to disguise.

640
00:35:40,475 --> 00:35:42,834
In short,It can be made with a simple printing process.

641
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:45,241
This is the principle of Fineness of work

642
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:50,100
Therefore, 1,2,3,4,5.
Here's how it works

643
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:54,475
So if we calculate the rankings of these three, we get the answer

644
00:35:54,858 --> 00:35:55,694
This is the answer

645
00:35:57,873 --> 00:36:00,842
10000yen is 10
5000yen is 11
1000yen is 6

646
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,163
500yen is 9
100yen is 9

647
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:05,702
so 1000 yen is the best

648
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,967
In short The best way to make counterfeit bills is to use 1,000 yen bills.

649
00:36:10,569 --> 00:36:14,373
Moreover There are already 10,000 of those 1,000 yen bills

650
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,780
What do you think about this plan?

651
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:18,092
Hmm

652
00:36:19,389 --> 00:36:24,178
I haven't seen a new bill in 12 years.
This is the negligence of the Bank of Japan.

653
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:30,061
It also makes sense to issue a warning to the Bank of Japan

654
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:32,811
so you can be my partner?

655
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,577
Did you really think I'd say no?

656
00:36:37,264 --> 00:36:42,225
Well..We're dealing with a nation, and it has no more power than we do.

657
00:36:43,561 --> 00:36:44,991
This is worth fighting for

658
00:36:45,038 --> 00:36:48,232
You think so?
so Let' have a toast

659
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:55,913
By the way So there's five of us, including me.

660
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:56,647
Yes

661
00:36:57,288 --> 00:36:58,748
Is the one million yen your money?

662
00:36:59,084 --> 00:36:59,780
No

663
00:37:00,373 --> 00:37:01,350
But don't worry

664
00:37:01,623 --> 00:37:03,600
The woman I'm marrying borrowed it

665
00:37:03,944 --> 00:37:04,389
From who?

666
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:05,811
From the Madam of the shop she works for.

667
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:07,483
Is that OK?

668
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:09,436
Don't worry, she is just a woman

669
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,967
A woman? A woman lends a woman a million yen?

670
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:13,061
What?

671
00:37:13,702 --> 00:37:14,288
Hiyama

672
00:37:15,139 --> 00:37:17,952
I'm sorry to have to say this but you should check where the money comes from

673
00:37:18,881 --> 00:37:19,288
I do

674
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:27,217
What do you want to talk with me?

675
00:37:27,248 --> 00:37:28,022
Yes...just a little

676
00:37:29,209 --> 00:37:30,569
Welcome.
What would you like？

677
00:37:30,928 --> 00:37:32,069
Don't worry, we will leave soon

678
00:37:32,108 --> 00:37:32,428
Yes

679
00:37:33,498 --> 00:37:34,913
I'm too busy now

680
00:37:38,014 --> 00:37:39,913
Did you really borrow that money from your Madam?

681
00:37:39,975 --> 00:37:40,655
Yes

682
00:37:41,163 --> 00:37:42,053
You're not lying?

683
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:44,459
What are you talking about?
You seem strange

684
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,529
Oh

685
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:46,889
Hi

686
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:49,272
Thank you very much

687
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,795
There's nothing else to talk about, is there?
I need to go

688
00:38:23,381 --> 00:38:24,170
How long does it take?

689
00:38:24,327 --> 00:38:24,725
It took 50 sec

690
00:38:24,889 --> 00:38:27,006
The more numbers we have, the better.

691
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:30,600
If it's one by one, it'll take 50 seconds per bill.

692
00:38:31,022 --> 00:38:32,694
10,000 bills will take 500,000 seconds.

693
00:38:35,366 --> 00:38:37,631
so 138 hours...

694
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:44,553
It would take us five days and eighteen hours of work without sleep.

695
00:38:46,655 --> 00:38:48,092
This would be hard work

696
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:52,170
If there is a printing error, it will be meaningless.

697
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:56,795
Therefore,Decide how we want to use it and then print the number

698
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:58,912
There are 2 ways how to use

699
00:38:59,553 --> 00:39:01,170
Short term and long term

700
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:03,077
Of course, it's better to use it in the short term.

701
00:39:03,295 --> 00:39:04,397
From every point of view

702
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:09,803
But If we want to use it in large quantities in a short period of time, we need to test it first.

703
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:10,373
Test?

704
00:39:10,663 --> 00:39:14,444
First, we'll use 10 to 20 bills to find out how long it takes to be discovered.

705
00:39:15,733 --> 00:39:18,123
Counterfeit bills will be discovered and their numbers will be made public.

706
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:24,366
Use counterfeit bills with different numbers all at once when the public's attention is focused on that number.

707
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:28,311
This is a test, but we can earn too

708
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:29,342
OK

709
00:39:30,373 --> 00:39:32,850
Then the simpler the number, the better.

710
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:36,623
Yes,for example, AB123456C

711
00:39:37,163 --> 00:39:38,889
That's too simple

712
00:39:38,998 --> 00:39:39,694
Anyway,let's try

713
00:40:05,241 --> 00:40:05,608
How is this?

714
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:10,834
CB654321A

715
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:14,467
Hmm? Number 4 has little error

716
00:40:14,764 --> 00:40:15,506
Let me see

717
00:40:17,162 --> 00:40:17,818
I see

718
00:40:18,748 --> 00:40:21,217
But This is a better way to think about it.

719
00:40:21,897 --> 00:40:24,702
The counterfeit bills would feature an error in the number four.

720
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:26,194
That's true

721
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:28,991
Good. let's do this way

722
00:40:29,991 --> 00:40:32,983
For the first test, we use 10 bills each

723
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,233
Keep the rest of bills

724
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:37,092
Why?

725
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:38,491
My house is not suitable

726
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:39,663
not suitable?

727
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:04,897
Piece

728
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:05,498
Yes

729
00:41:07,834 --> 00:41:09,209
Can I pay by 1000yen bill?

730
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,436
Here it is

731
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:18,209
Here is your change

732
00:41:18,834 --> 00:41:19,163
IS that OK?

733
00:41:19,248 --> 00:41:19,592
What?

734
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:22,452
That 1,000 yen bill could be a fake.

735
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:23,756
Maybe

736
00:41:24,131 --> 00:41:25,271
Thank you very much

737
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:34,936
Sorry for keeping you wait

738
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,678
Thank you very much

739
00:41:43,194 --> 00:41:44,296
Here it is

740
00:41:53,835 --> 00:41:55,077
Thank you very much

741
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,139
Sorry for keeping you wait.
It's 100 yen

742
00:42:03,975 --> 00:42:05,030
Thank you very much

743
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:07,701
Ah, you forgot something

744
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,233
Here it is

745
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:14,788
Thanks

746
00:42:15,694 --> 00:42:17,592
This is new bill

747
00:42:18,866 --> 00:42:19,967
It's been a long time to receive new one

748
00:42:19,992 --> 00:42:21,264
That's good luck

749
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:22,436
I can give you a discount

750
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:23,217
No thanks.
400yen is ok

751
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,358
I see.
Thank you very much

752
00:42:29,561 --> 00:42:30,624
You don't have small coins?

753
00:42:30,803 --> 00:42:31,467
NO

754
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,053
Thank you very much

755
00:42:50,835 --> 00:42:51,842
Sorry for keeping you wait

756
00:42:53,163 --> 00:42:54,155
That’s 800 yen

757
00:42:56,756 --> 00:42:57,874
Could you wait a min?

758
00:43:00,296 --> 00:43:01,475
Thank you very much

759
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:06,514
What a good smelling.
I will eat

760
00:43:15,256 --> 00:43:16,686
This is very delicious

761
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:19,921
How is your business going?

762
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,194
Good

763
00:43:21,678 --> 00:43:23,421
I'm glad to hear that

764
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,444
I'll tell you about my work in a little while

765
00:43:26,913 --> 00:43:29,889
Don't worry.
I'd be happy if you like the job

766
00:43:33,881 --> 00:43:35,772
What's wrong?
Why you don't eat?

767
00:43:36,577 --> 00:43:38,991
I spent all that money on the business.

768
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:41,139
That money is for that

769
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:42,842
Eiko

770
00:43:43,927 --> 00:43:47,591
Tell me the truth.
Where did that money come from?

771
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:49,483
From where?

772
00:43:49,999 --> 00:43:51,241
You've hidden something

773
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,178
Who?
Tell me

774
00:43:54,225 --> 00:43:54,967
From which guy?

775
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,546
A Guy?

776
00:43:55,654 --> 00:43:56,248
Who?

777
00:43:57,381 --> 00:43:58,694
Who?
Tell me

778
00:44:00,585 --> 00:44:04,592
Um.
I knew I wouldn't tell you under any circumstances.

779
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,624
If you are so jealous..

780
00:44:06,717 --> 00:44:07,530
jealous?

781
00:44:07,608 --> 00:44:08,249
Yes

782
00:44:08,585 --> 00:44:12,014
It was my madam who gave me a million yen for sure

783
00:44:14,022 --> 00:44:17,741
But what happen if we can't return it in 3 months....

784
00:44:17,796 --> 00:44:18,647
What happen?

785
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:23,585
The owner of an appliance store near the store will pay on our behalf.

786
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:26,452
Remember?
We met him at coffee shop other day

787
00:44:26,952 --> 00:44:28,280
44 or 45 years old man

788
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:31,475
Why he will pay your debit ?

789
00:44:32,233 --> 00:44:35,389
Eh?
Why? Why he pays?

790
00:44:37,991 --> 00:44:42,538
He said to me he can support me to open a store

791
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:46,546
I see.
So you freaked out and went out.

792
00:44:48,124 --> 00:44:49,350
You and he are already!

793
00:44:49,375 --> 00:44:49,874
Stop talking!

794
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:52,006
Stop doing imagination

795
00:44:53,061 --> 00:44:56,686
You don't know how I feel

796
00:44:58,686 --> 00:45:01,116
You are too bad! terrible!

797
00:45:12,819 --> 00:45:15,350
Eiko does not know.
She know nothing

798
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:18,452
She does no know I use the fake money

799
00:45:19,421 --> 00:45:21,061
What happen if she knows it

800
00:45:23,069 --> 00:45:26,069
Wait..I wonder Ishiwatari is ok

801
00:45:27,077 --> 00:45:31,397
I can trust him.
But That woman seems to talk too much.

802
00:45:36,764 --> 00:45:38,381
Hey! What are you doing?

803
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:40,850
Give me your hands!
I will put this down

804
00:45:41,163 --> 00:45:42,303
That is summer cloth

805
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:47,092
Yes,There's a model competition tomorrow for summer clothes that pay me 5,000 yen.

806
00:45:47,671 --> 00:45:49,600
Stop it.
You can do it tomorrow

807
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,046
I need to go early tomorrow.
I need to prepare it today

808
00:45:52,186 --> 00:45:53,624
Stop! Stop it!

809
00:46:05,702 --> 00:46:06,522
You idiot!

810
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:37,850
Ah...

811
00:47:06,655 --> 00:47:08,952
What did you see?

812
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:11,788
I saw great things

813
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,889
What did you see?

814
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:15,772
You're in trouble if I talk.

815
00:47:16,139 --> 00:47:17,006
I will be in trouble?

816
00:47:17,866 --> 00:47:18,803
When did you see it?

817
00:47:18,928 --> 00:47:22,006
last night.
I wonder what time was it...

818
00:47:25,881 --> 00:47:27,967
Really?
Did you really see it?

819
00:47:28,311 --> 00:47:31,960
Yes.I saw it through a crack in the wall.

820
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:34,030
I was like this

821
00:47:34,296 --> 00:47:37,522
Please do not tell this to anyone

822
00:47:37,547 --> 00:47:40,421
Depends on the terms you give me.

823
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:43,100
Please. I can go to Izu with you

824
00:47:43,405 --> 00:47:44,467
Are you sure?

825
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:46,538
I promise I can go with you

826
00:47:47,514 --> 00:47:48,546
OK then I won't tell anyone else

827
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:51,280
To be honest,Those are all fake money

828
00:47:51,975 --> 00:47:52,936
fake money?

829
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:55,874
You really saw that?

830
00:47:56,225 --> 00:47:58,100
Yes... I saw it

831
00:47:58,405 --> 00:47:59,827
Of course I saw it

832
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:21,092
Hiyama

833
00:48:22,233 --> 00:48:24,374
I'm responsible for what happened.

834
00:48:25,296 --> 00:48:28,092
Now that they've found us, we have no choice.

835
00:48:28,944 --> 00:48:29,702
We have no choice?

836
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:31,608
That's it

837
00:48:32,108 --> 00:48:35,764
If it bothers you, I'll back off.

838
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:40,772
The two of you actually used counterfeit money

839
00:48:42,061 --> 00:48:44,397
I'm the person who just know of it

840
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:46,303
Hiyama

841
00:48:47,335 --> 00:48:51,749
He knows so We should ask him to join us

842
00:48:54,772 --> 00:48:59,124
And Your goal is to cash in as quickly as possible.

843
00:49:01,381 --> 00:49:01,999
Is that right?

844
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:09,835
OK I accept him

845
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:13,421
But Promise me you won't add more than these four.

846
00:49:13,514 --> 00:49:15,561
Of course I promise that

847
00:49:16,147 --> 00:49:16,835
How about you?

848
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:20,225
I don't need to tell you.
The more people you have, the less you get for your share.

849
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:23,085
Even baby know this

850
00:49:23,678 --> 00:49:26,249
If there are four of us, how much is our share?

851
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:27,092
Let me see

852
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:30,592
Hiyama gets 4500000

853
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,389
Our couple gets 3500000

854
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:33,999
Yamaguchi gets 1000000

855
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:37,069
So Just us, a million less?

856
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:38,202
Yes

857
00:49:38,577 --> 00:49:40,006
Ishiwatari is two people

858
00:49:40,404 --> 00:49:42,397
so 3500000 ok, Hiyama too

859
00:49:42,967 --> 00:49:44,022
and I get 2000000

860
00:49:44,631 --> 00:49:46,296
I think this is fair.

861
00:49:46,366 --> 00:49:50,186
No...This was Hiyama's idea.

862
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,171
Originally, it was just the two of us.

863
00:49:53,710 --> 00:49:55,210
You're not the ones who matter.

864
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:56,913
You may be right

865
00:49:58,694 --> 00:50:00,280
OK then We'll compromise

866
00:50:01,756 --> 00:50:04,639
1000000 yen is big money for me now

867
00:50:06,444 --> 00:50:06,936
What do you think?

868
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,256
SO let's get move on!

869
00:50:11,444 --> 00:50:13,241
I have a car so we can go wherever we want

870
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:14,741
Stop! you talk too much

871
00:50:15,702 --> 00:50:17,046
Mind your mouth

872
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:19,561
It's not like selling cosmetics

873
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:22,264
I don't like it when you say that.
but I will be careful

874
00:50:23,866 --> 00:50:26,772
By the way I've been using 20 bills for 9 days now.

875
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:29,710
There is no news for that.
What's wrong?

876
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:34,585
Counterfeit bills must be circulating, and one should be discovered.

877
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:38,311
In reality, some of them must have been found.
The police have yet to make an announcement.

878
00:50:39,084 --> 00:50:40,295
The police may be investigating

879
00:50:40,975 --> 00:50:44,061
The police investigation may have gotten to us.

880
00:50:45,991 --> 00:50:47,600
But when I think about it..

881
00:50:48,811 --> 00:50:53,538
In a counterfeit money investigation, unlike corruption or election fraud,
the finder can't be the culprit or accomplice.

882
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:57,085
It was an accident.
The police don't have to hide it.

883
00:50:59,093 --> 00:51:01,639
It was an accident. The police don't have to hide it.

884
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:02,850
It might be so

885
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:06,499
If one of them is found, some newspaper will report it.

886
00:51:07,507 --> 00:51:08,647
Some newspaper will report it.

887
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:11,014
Ah, Please wait

888
00:51:16,374 --> 00:51:17,718
Is it Trump fortune telling?

889
00:51:17,796 --> 00:51:20,740
Yes,I'll show you I'm a professional fortune teller.

890
00:51:22,061 --> 00:51:23,772
Let me see

891
00:51:25,483 --> 00:51:29,225
Don't worry.
The reason they can't find it is because the counterfeit money is so well made.

892
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:31,061
Yes I think so

893
00:51:34,686 --> 00:51:35,491
Hiyama-san

894
00:51:35,678 --> 00:51:36,257
oh!

895
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:37,452
Hiyama-san

896
00:51:37,991 --> 00:51:38,936
It's been a long time

897
00:51:39,093 --> 00:51:39,772
Where are you going?

898
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:40,397
I'm going home

899
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,343
I see.
I will send you

900
00:51:42,928 --> 00:51:43,436
Please get in car

901
00:51:43,694 --> 00:51:44,116
Thanks

902
00:51:46,530 --> 00:51:46,905
Please

903
00:51:47,835 --> 00:51:48,069
Hi

904
00:51:49,436 --> 00:51:51,124
Oh you! come in

905
00:51:53,608 --> 00:51:54,796
How is your business going?

906
00:51:54,936 --> 00:51:56,186
Yes, no bad

907
00:51:56,787 --> 00:51:57,631
How about you?

908
00:51:57,733 --> 00:51:59,835
Everything has been changed

909
00:52:00,468 --> 00:52:03,694
Oh yeah, Did you know Mr. Yoshida was promoted to section chief?

910
00:52:03,811 --> 00:52:06,436
Oh..Congratulation

911
00:52:06,718 --> 00:52:10,921
Because you left from our company.
This guy Watanabe is placed for your former position

912
00:52:11,288 --> 00:52:11,874
Good for you

913
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,085
Thank you very much

914
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:16,389
By the way, Are you still with the woman, kashiwagi?

915
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:18,171
Why you ask me that?

916
00:52:18,249 --> 00:52:20,288
I ran into her the other day in a strange place.

917
00:52:20,561 --> 00:52:20,983
Did you meet her?

918
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:22,686
She was in front of a hotel in Sendagaya

919
00:52:22,990 --> 00:52:23,842
Sendagaya?

920
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,194
I averted my face because it wasn't convenient for me either.

921
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:44,374
Wait

922
00:52:44,889 --> 00:52:45,639
Are you Mr.Hiyama,aren't you?

923
00:52:45,749 --> 00:52:45,960
Yes

924
00:52:45,991 --> 00:52:47,147
This is a letter for you

925
00:52:47,201 --> 00:52:47,803
Thank you

926
00:52:55,257 --> 00:52:57,382
I'm going to Ito for the town's consolation trip.

927
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:02,686
I wasn't going to go, but I couldn't say no, so I will.

928
00:53:03,132 --> 00:53:04,944
I will be back tomorrow.
Eiko

929
00:53:58,529 --> 00:54:00,123
I can't tell the difference between this one and the real one.

930
00:54:00,194 --> 00:54:02,186
The number 4 has a slight error.

931
00:54:02,241 --> 00:54:03,358
This is the characterize

932
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:06,522
And The numbers are easy to remember.

933
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:07,139
Um

934
00:54:08,959 --> 00:54:09,225
Light

935
00:54:09,350 --> 00:54:09,757
Yes

936
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:17,475
It's so well done, I think They printed a lot of them.

937
00:54:17,615 --> 00:54:18,233
Yes

938
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:22,124
The watermark is clear.

939
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:25,921
It's slipperier than the real thing.

940
00:54:26,874 --> 00:54:28,311
The ink on the numbers is a little off.

941
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:31,600
This is Section 3. Hun? At where?

942
00:54:31,741 --> 00:54:32,397
Here

943
00:54:32,491 --> 00:54:35,022
Wait a min, Chief.
Another bill was found again

944
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,132
Hello. It's me

945
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:42,490
What? CB654321, yes

946
00:54:43,428 --> 00:54:45,085
and at where?

947
00:54:47,475 --> 00:54:48,983
Chuo Bank, Kyobashi Branch

948
00:54:49,749 --> 00:54:51,522
I get it.
Thank you

949
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:56,678
As I thought They widely used.

950
00:54:56,749 --> 00:54:57,335
Right

951
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:04,217
The hard part about counterfeit money cases is that it's a crime until the criminal uses it for the first time.

952
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:08,186
It is not a crime for others to use counterfeit money.

953
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:11,139
There's no relationship between the killer and the user.

954
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:17,702
I know it's a hassle, but let's go through all the printing houses.

955
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:21,147
Publicize and get the private sector to cooperate.

956
00:55:22,225 --> 00:55:24,522
Let's do this two ways.

957
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:27,553
Welcome home

958
00:55:28,483 --> 00:55:29,538
It's cold outside,isn't it?

959
00:55:33,139 --> 00:55:34,350
You know what, Kenji

960
00:55:35,014 --> 00:55:38,889
There is news about counterfeit money.
They say it's well done.

961
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:49,162
This is a souvenir for you

962
00:55:50,132 --> 00:55:51,702
I enjoyed at Ito

963
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:55,405
The fish is very good.
I'll prepare some tea now.

964
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,194
I don't want

965
00:55:57,061 --> 00:55:58,405
Oh What's wrong?

966
00:56:00,413 --> 00:56:03,319
Oh you are upset that I went to Ito

967
00:56:04,343 --> 00:56:05,702
You saw the letter I wrote, right?

968
00:56:06,218 --> 00:56:08,522
I didn't want to go, but I had to.

969
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,436
Oh What's wrong?

970
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:15,444
I met Yoshida yesterday

971
00:56:15,678 --> 00:56:16,194
I see

972
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:20,718
You went to a hotel in Sendagaya with a guy,Tokorohara,right?

973
00:56:21,796 --> 00:56:23,061
I went to a Hotel with Tokorohara?

974
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,507
Yoshida said he saw it

975
00:56:29,577 --> 00:56:32,530
Are you sure?
Do you really think so?

976
00:56:33,975 --> 00:56:35,639
Please reply me clearly

977
00:56:37,022 --> 00:56:38,421
You're a miserable man.

978
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:41,686
I can't believe you trust Yoshida more than me.

979
00:56:44,046 --> 00:56:48,147
If you underestimate me, you'll underestimate yourself.

980
00:56:51,624 --> 00:56:55,116
If you think so, I will leave here

981
00:56:58,671 --> 00:56:59,132
Eiko!

982
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:06,326
I'm bad.
I'm a miserable man as you told me

983
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:15,686
I don't understand myself

984
00:57:16,678 --> 00:57:18,694
The only thing I know is

985
00:57:18,905 --> 00:57:21,678
I will be mess if you leave from me

986
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:24,499
You're not doing so well at work?

987
00:57:27,561 --> 00:57:29,944
I only have a month left to pay back the money.

988
00:57:30,616 --> 00:57:31,623
What happen if If I fail...

989
00:57:31,764 --> 00:57:34,116
Why do you think about failing?

990
00:57:34,757 --> 00:57:36,843
Please go ahead your work

991
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:40,968
I believe you will be success

992
00:57:41,694 --> 00:57:43,647
So I borrowed the money.

993
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:49,897
If you have time to doubt me, please do your job.

994
00:57:50,655 --> 00:57:51,921
So Please go for it

995
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:05,155
I don't care if you try and fail.

996
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:09,616
Everything will be OK in the end.

997
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:12,827
So Please do not worry

998
00:58:22,389 --> 00:58:25,678
The CB bill has the following five features

999
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:29,905
1.The arrangement of the numbers is a little uneven.

1000
00:58:30,163 --> 00:58:32,889
3.The texture looks like it was painted with wax.

1001
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:35,991
4.The watermark is blurred.

1002
00:58:36,343 --> 00:58:40,725
All number is CB654321A

1003
00:58:41,031 --> 00:58:42,859
All five are in line with our calculations.

1004
00:58:43,085 --> 00:58:45,249
Operation One is a success.

1005
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:49,921
All the counterfeit money was discovered by financial institutions. The public doesn't understand.

1006
00:58:50,248 --> 00:58:52,108
So far there is no problem

1007
00:58:52,382 --> 00:58:53,226
we can print the number on the bill

1008
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:54,351
We should wait another 15 bills are discovered

1009
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:57,109
We don't need to wait

1010
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:58,288
Hiyama-san

1011
00:58:59,577 --> 00:59:00,069
We don't need to wait

1012
00:59:00,218 --> 00:59:01,687
3 people of us thinks we don't need to wait

1013
00:59:04,898 --> 00:59:07,046
Ok, then what kind of number shall we print?

1014
00:59:07,327 --> 00:59:09,843
Why don't we make 10 sets of 1,000 copies each of the same number?

1015
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:11,570
I have a good idea

1016
00:59:15,296 --> 00:59:16,460
Let's do this

1017
00:59:16,585 --> 00:59:19,671
This is what I use in these situations.

1018
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:24,663
Here we go

1019
00:59:26,156 --> 00:59:26,867
8

1020
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:27,749
7

1021
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:28,929
8

1022
00:59:29,585 --> 00:59:29,992
5

1023
00:59:30,663 --> 00:59:31,179
3

1024
00:59:31,874 --> 00:59:32,929
6..here are they

1025
00:59:33,327 --> 00:59:33,921
What's the code?

1026
00:59:34,749 --> 00:59:37,007
There is an alphabet on the card.

1027
00:59:37,601 --> 00:59:40,765
There are 52 sheets, so you can make two sets of alphabets.

1028
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:43,851
Put them in a row, three at a time.

1029
00:59:44,656 --> 00:59:44,960
What do you think?

1030
00:59:45,117 --> 00:59:46,859
Let's do this way now

1031
00:59:47,233 --> 00:59:48,577
Please choose the first number,Yamaguchi

1032
00:59:48,687 --> 00:59:49,398
Leave it to me

1033
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,843
How is it going?

1034
01:00:17,554 --> 01:00:21,272
At this rate, it will take about 80 hours.

1035
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,874
We'll get used to it, go a little faster, and be done in three days.

1036
01:00:24,202 --> 01:00:25,679
We can start using it in four days.

1037
01:00:25,827 --> 01:00:27,601
The problem is how to spend

1038
01:00:28,421 --> 01:00:29,538
How about this idea?

1039
01:00:30,046 --> 01:00:34,062
Four of us scattered all over Tokyo to shop.

1040
01:00:34,445 --> 01:00:36,397
One shop at a time, every half hour.

1041
01:00:36,429 --> 01:00:38,905
No way. 20 bills per 10 hours

1042
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:41,874
We have an hour to move around.

1043
01:00:42,046 --> 01:00:43,351
We'll be tired.

1044
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:44,281
How about the station?

1045
01:00:45,273 --> 01:00:49,085
Buy the next ticket at the first station, then buy another one at the next station.

1046
01:00:49,984 --> 01:00:51,413
We can spend 1 bill in 10 min

1047
01:00:51,796 --> 01:00:53,218
That's a good idea

1048
01:00:54,007 --> 01:00:56,804
How many stations are there?
Four people moving.

1049
01:00:57,593 --> 01:00:59,406
If we use it enough times, they'll remember our face.

1050
01:00:59,609 --> 01:01:00,952
That's bad too

1051
01:01:01,031 --> 01:01:03,984
How many bills can we spend in a day?

1052
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:07,093
Let me see...
1 bill per 30 min

1053
01:01:07,195 --> 01:01:10,031
We work 8 hour a day, so 1 hour 16 bills

1054
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:13,921
We work 25 days a month so 400bills

1055
01:01:14,093 --> 01:01:14,710
so 400000yen

1056
01:01:14,929 --> 01:01:17,484
Not that easy. We buy something, not exchange money

1057
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:20,257
I see..so...

1058
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:23,609
Expenses are 10% per person, so 360,000 yen per person.

1059
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:27,304
for 4 people, It will be 1440000yen

1060
01:01:27,367 --> 01:01:28,242
Only?

1061
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:31,960
So if we spend million...

1062
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:34,249
No

1063
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:36,288
It takes 7 months

1064
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:38,663
The police will find us.

1065
01:01:38,859 --> 01:01:40,999
So What should we do then?

1066
01:01:41,117 --> 01:01:42,046
Be quiet!

1067
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:42,640
Because

1068
01:01:43,726 --> 01:01:45,320
I have a good idea!

1069
01:01:45,781 --> 01:01:47,476
We can go to Hong Kong then exchange them

1070
01:01:48,163 --> 01:01:48,867
Hong Kong?

1071
01:01:49,304 --> 01:01:51,788
I know someone who concern about Hong Kong

1072
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:56,007
He often goes to Hong Kong

1073
01:01:56,452 --> 01:01:56,984
So?

1074
01:01:57,390 --> 01:02:01,343
We can ask him to exchange money without saying that is counterfeit.

1075
01:02:01,929 --> 01:02:04,687
We'll give him 10% commission and ask him to exchange them for dollars.

1076
01:02:05,624 --> 01:02:08,156
I think He can exchange these for dollars.

1077
01:02:09,023 --> 01:02:12,093
In Hong Kong, they'd never know they were counterfeit money.

1078
01:02:12,288 --> 01:02:13,757
I agree.
Let's do it

1079
01:02:14,023 --> 01:02:18,031
It's dangerous to get involved with such a smuggling ring.

1080
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:22,234
If we can exchange money in Hong Kong, that's the best way.

1081
01:02:22,359 --> 01:02:25,639
Leave it to me.
I will study for it

1082
01:02:45,617 --> 01:02:46,281
Director

1083
01:02:47,843 --> 01:02:50,218
The printing companies were fine.

1084
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:53,484
Researching private companies can be time consuming.

1085
01:02:53,851 --> 01:02:56,351
We don't keep that data on file with the police.

1086
01:02:56,913 --> 01:02:58,085
Don't be weak.

1087
01:02:58,531 --> 01:03:00,632
You can do it.

1088
01:03:00,827 --> 01:03:03,554
lately I'm tired

1089
01:03:04,515 --> 01:03:09,460
The owner of the butcher shop in Asakusa who deposited the counterfeit bills found at the Oriental Bank yesterday is here.

1090
01:03:29,515 --> 01:03:31,171
We have just done half

1091
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:33,921
I wonder this will finish by tomorrow morning

1092
01:03:34,835 --> 01:03:36,561
Can you help me?

1093
01:03:36,593 --> 01:03:38,585
No No. you should do 250 bills

1094
01:03:38,867 --> 01:03:42,093
My arms were really tired.

1095
01:03:43,874 --> 01:03:44,913
Let me see

1096
01:04:08,429 --> 01:04:10,577
It was in the evening, the busiest time of the day.

1097
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:18,663
If I recall, it's 1,000 yen for a customer who bought ground beef

1098
01:04:18,835 --> 01:04:20,304
Do you remember his face?

1099
01:04:21,296 --> 01:04:22,538
Let me see

1100
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:25,671
It was so busy so

1101
01:04:27,186 --> 01:04:28,819
Let me see...

1102
01:04:29,053 --> 01:04:30,358
Wait a min

1103
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:34,952
The man is 42.3 years old.

1104
01:04:35,257 --> 01:04:37,343
dark skin and wear glass

1105
01:04:38,452 --> 01:04:42,367
Until now, 17 CB bills have been found

1106
01:04:42,968 --> 01:04:47,945
They've announced they're offering 10,000 yen to anyone who finds counterfeit bills.

1107
01:04:49,054 --> 01:04:51,085
That's all for the news

1108
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:55,038
10,000 yen?
No bad

1109
01:04:56,585 --> 01:04:58,523
Ha if we brought them all, they will be 100 million yen

1110
01:04:59,945 --> 01:05:02,234
You should take a rest,Hiyama-san

1111
01:05:02,882 --> 01:05:05,788
We have to finish it by tomorrow morning.
We have no time

1112
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:11,765
There are 900 bills left

1113
01:05:12,077 --> 01:05:14,874
I will take a rest for it

1114
01:06:19,788 --> 01:06:21,812
Hey, Finished all!

1115
01:06:24,054 --> 01:06:24,718
Done?

1116
01:06:24,851 --> 01:06:25,515
We did it!

1117
01:06:27,468 --> 01:06:27,749
Hey

1118
01:06:51,195 --> 01:06:51,796
This is

1119
01:06:52,624 --> 01:06:54,242
Is last night's news on it?

1120
01:06:56,593 --> 01:06:58,031
I saw the criminal

1121
01:07:00,444 --> 01:07:01,725
Look this photo!

1122
01:07:05,437 --> 01:07:07,570
I will see the person after I had a breakfast

1123
01:07:07,952 --> 01:07:08,757
I will go with you

1124
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:09,632
Yes please

1125
01:07:09,890 --> 01:07:10,367
Take care

1126
01:07:10,492 --> 01:07:12,148
Leave it to me.
Don't worry

1127
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:18,468
That man lives a long way

1128
01:07:18,773 --> 01:07:19,937
Tama liver is there soon

1129
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:20,851
He lives there

1130
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:25,555
Oh my god

1131
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:28,828
Stop

1132
01:07:43,758 --> 01:07:45,140
How much have you talked to that person?

1133
01:07:45,328 --> 01:07:46,219
How much?

1134
01:07:46,726 --> 01:07:48,344
Didn't you tell him it was counterfeit money?

1135
01:07:48,539 --> 01:07:49,359
Of course not

1136
01:07:49,742 --> 01:07:52,047
I asked him to exchange them into dollar

1137
01:07:53,094 --> 01:07:55,555
But What if he tells someone?

1138
01:07:55,976 --> 01:07:57,609
Do not look down him

1139
01:07:58,008 --> 01:08:03,211
People who work in that world don't talk about it to others.

1140
01:08:03,758 --> 01:08:08,187
Either way, We need to cash out soon.
The police are investigating the printing house.

1141
01:08:15,664 --> 01:08:17,562
We don't have enough time

1142
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,015
Let's go back now

1143
01:08:19,289 --> 01:08:20,000
Yamaguchi

1144
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:20,656
What?

1145
01:08:20,992 --> 01:08:22,133
Is today Saturday?

1146
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:22,898
Yes

1147
01:08:23,117 --> 01:08:23,984
Let's go

1148
01:08:46,390 --> 01:08:48,922
I went to the bicycle race track in Korakuen on my way home to check it out.

1149
01:08:49,883 --> 01:08:51,758
The exchange window is the same as for horse racing.

1150
01:08:53,430 --> 01:08:55,781
What was the number of visitors to the bicycle race yesterday?

1151
01:08:57,469 --> 01:08:59,492
33237people

1152
01:09:00,101 --> 01:09:03,937
Ticket sales are 1599798400yen

1153
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:08,867
Japanese yen circulating in Hong Kong is being used in bicycle races in just four or five hours.

1154
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,601
So you plan to exchange money at race

1155
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:12,328
Yes

1156
01:09:12,695 --> 01:09:15,289
If you're exchanging money, you'll get 1,000 yen, unlike if you're buying merchandise.

1157
01:09:15,843 --> 01:09:19,586
If we exchange 10,000 yen each at one time, that's 400,000 yen for four people.

1158
01:09:20,101 --> 01:09:21,555
There are 10 races a day

1159
01:09:21,695 --> 01:09:22,289
so 400000 yen?

1160
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:25,172
No,
Last race is at 4:00.

1161
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,828
It took an hour for the window to close after that dividend was decided.

1162
01:09:29,219 --> 01:09:30,133
5 hours in total

1163
01:09:31,086 --> 01:09:33,273
Each exchange takes five minutes.

1164
01:09:33,672 --> 01:09:34,719
One person can exchange 60 times

1165
01:09:34,937 --> 01:09:36,219
We can do 50 carefully.

1166
01:09:36,484 --> 01:09:40,008
So each one spend 500000 yen so million yen a day

1167
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:43,617
But If We exchange money 50 times per person,We're in danger of having our faces remembered.

1168
01:09:43,703 --> 01:09:49,656
The window is so crowded they can't afford to look at our face.

1169
01:09:50,711 --> 01:09:53,445
But In some places, They can see our faces.

1170
01:09:54,234 --> 01:09:57,000
So Exchange money during crowded times.

1171
01:09:57,687 --> 01:10:00,476
However in case of the race in Korakuen last night

1172
01:10:01,047 --> 01:10:03,781
We were 4 people in 340000 people

1173
01:10:05,383 --> 01:10:08,226
They can't remember 1/8000

1174
01:10:08,937 --> 01:10:13,523
Or The percentage of that happening would be even lower if the four of us went to separate racetracks.

1175
01:10:15,734 --> 01:10:17,476
That's what the face reveal is for.

1176
01:10:17,578 --> 01:10:23,038
The worry things is..exchange is the process of making 10,000 yen or 1,000 yen into smaller amounts.

1177
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:25,656
This is common sense

1178
01:10:26,156 --> 01:10:29,702
But We will try to turning 1,000 yen into 10,000 yen.
moreover we will try this many times

1179
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,117
You don't worry about it?

1180
01:10:31,648 --> 01:10:34,187
Of course, I've already researched it

1181
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,031
In reality,I have been turned 1,000 yen into 10,000 yen.
It's not unnatural.

1182
01:10:38,945 --> 01:10:40,164
That's what I'm trying to do

1183
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:43,617
Our 1,000 yen bill will be used soon.

1184
01:10:44,094 --> 01:10:48,859
The money changers will be happy , because they want 1,000 yen bills.

1185
01:10:49,336 --> 01:10:51,461
Mmmm.. I see

1186
01:10:52,156 --> 01:10:53,797
But the bills are problem

1187
01:10:54,156 --> 01:10:56,765
Even if Our 1,000 yen bill will be used soon

1188
01:10:57,390 --> 01:11:00,437
They'll be suspicious when they get new bills again.

1189
01:11:01,008 --> 01:11:03,969
Yes, It might be so

1190
01:11:04,687 --> 01:11:07,805
So..here is my Retirement Payment 200000 yen

1191
01:11:08,805 --> 01:11:11,875
We can mix and match these bills.

1192
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:18,367
So we need to make our counterfeit bills look like the old ones.

1193
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,578
You are very smart, Hiyama-san

1194
01:11:22,789 --> 01:11:23,945
I worry another one

1195
01:11:24,586 --> 01:11:27,633
After the bicycle race is over, the bills are taken to the bank.

1196
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:30,492
The bank will know for sure.

1197
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,976
This is the weak point

1198
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:35,375
But there is a way

1199
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:35,867
What kind?

1200
01:11:35,937 --> 01:11:37,101
We can do on Saturday and Sunday

1201
01:11:37,336 --> 01:11:41,664
I see.
Bank close on Sunday and work till noon on Saturday

1202
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:45,328
Yes.
When the money is brought in on a Saturday night, there's no banker.

1203
01:11:46,015 --> 01:11:48,469
The counterfeit bills won't be discovered until Monday morning at the earliest.

1204
01:11:48,711 --> 01:11:49,359
What day of the week today?

1205
01:11:49,484 --> 01:11:50,156
It's Friday

1206
01:11:50,219 --> 01:11:52,562
Oh..and 13th

1207
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,219
As I told you before,
We have to use counterfeit money in a short period of time.

1208
01:11:57,953 --> 01:12:03,219
So this Saturday and Sunday, We should divide into 2 group and exchange money at Chiba and Hiratsuka

1209
01:12:04,344 --> 01:12:07,453
Then We can gather in Ito Sunday night.
And we can exchange money at racetrack in Ito

1210
01:12:08,086 --> 01:12:11,734
In case the police are called, we'll be in Ito.

1211
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:14,726
The police are slow to arrive because of the different jurisdictions.

1212
01:12:14,875 --> 01:12:18,844
By your calculations, We can only exchange 6 million dollars in three days.

1213
01:12:19,594 --> 01:12:23,484
Anyway let's do this. The rest of money, We can consider later

1214
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:24,219
How is it?

1215
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:26,086
Um.. and

1216
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,961
It's a local bicycle race track, so there may not be many visitors.

1217
01:12:30,742 --> 01:12:32,914
Pay attention to the situation at the counter.

1218
01:12:33,226 --> 01:12:35,836
You can change the number of times you exchange money.

1219
01:12:36,797 --> 01:12:39,398
Then let's camouflage that bill.

1220
01:12:39,687 --> 01:12:40,094
Let's do

1221
01:13:08,765 --> 01:13:10,375
I bought 10000yen ticket too!

1222
01:13:11,242 --> 01:13:16,711
My prediction is correct for the Hiratsuka bicycle race.

1223
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:21,594


1224
01:13:21,613 --> 01:13:25,648
Statistically speaking,The date of the event last year's September/October/1112

1225
01:13:30,539 --> 01:13:32,094
We should wait until first race is finished

1226
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,742
Hello,You have dropped this

1227
01:15:04,476 --> 01:15:05,687
What name of inn in Ito?

1228
01:15:05,828 --> 01:15:06,898
Let's decide when we meet at the station

1229
01:15:07,578 --> 01:15:09,945
I want to go to hot spring,and have a drink

1230
01:15:11,953 --> 01:15:13,812
We will miss the train.
Let's get ready

1231
01:15:15,687 --> 01:15:16,523
What's wrong?

1232
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:18,242
There is something on the newspaper?

1233
01:15:21,047 --> 01:15:27,999
Club Sumi's madam Sumie Higuchi found a new 1,000 yen bill on the street in Tsukishima 3-chome last evening

1234
01:15:28,656 --> 01:15:35,749
and delivered it to the police station, where it turned out to be a counterfeit bill.

1235
01:15:36,422 --> 01:15:43,578
This bill is the same as the CB bill, but the number is KE836475M

1236
01:15:44,587 --> 01:15:45,931
Club sumi is Miyagawa's?

1237
01:15:46,095 --> 01:15:46,447
Yes

1238
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,377
We didn't print this number

1239
01:15:49,650 --> 01:15:52,525
The same kind of bills can't have fallen in Tokyo

1240
01:15:55,541 --> 01:15:56,400
I'm going to Tokyo

1241
01:15:56,611 --> 01:15:57,134
Tokyo?

1242
01:15:57,298 --> 01:15:58,783
This could be calling me

1243
01:15:59,064 --> 01:15:59,533
Who?

1244
01:15:59,853 --> 01:16:00,775
Sumie Higuchi

1245
01:16:01,533 --> 01:16:04,455
Look this KIMONO.
K.E.N..Its KEN

1246
01:16:05,173 --> 01:16:06,775
She calls me as KEN

1247
01:16:08,033 --> 01:16:09,673
Maybe something happen

1248
01:16:10,728 --> 01:16:13,166
OK, Let's see you tomorrow 30 minutes before departure at gate

1249
01:16:15,314 --> 01:16:17,915
The location the bill was is here

1250
01:16:18,939 --> 01:16:20,009
Oh! Here!

1251
01:16:21,595 --> 01:16:22,416
Here?

1252
01:16:22,494 --> 01:16:24,072
She can get 10000yen for the prize money

1253
01:16:24,097 --> 01:16:25,790
We missed getting 10,000 yen.

1254
01:16:25,877 --> 01:16:27,705
I'm really unlucky

1255
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,691
Because you're walking around looking up

1256
01:16:29,738 --> 01:16:32,652
I wouldn't expect to find it down there.

1257
01:16:37,206 --> 01:16:38,643
Did you pass by here too?

1258
01:16:38,683 --> 01:16:41,292
I passed over that woman

1259
01:16:42,323 --> 01:16:44,714
So Did you pass right in front of that woman?

1260
01:16:44,948 --> 01:16:47,573
Yes, I wonder why I didn't notice it

1261
01:16:48,050 --> 01:16:49,277
I'm really unlucky

1262
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:33,261
You've called be as I thought

1263
01:17:33,839 --> 01:17:35,128
It was too late

1264
01:17:35,605 --> 01:17:36,370
It was too late?

1265
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:40,995
Who is it?

1266
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,292
Who is this guy?

1267
01:17:44,613 --> 01:17:46,222
The printer I made work.

1268
01:17:47,159 --> 01:17:50,238
He's here to beg for money

1269
01:17:51,284 --> 01:17:53,159
He suddenly went berserk

1270
01:17:54,605 --> 01:17:55,472
so that man did...

1271
01:17:58,933 --> 01:18:00,565
What should I do?

1272
01:18:00,761 --> 01:18:03,573
It has nothing to do with me or you guys.
You promised me.

1273
01:18:04,339 --> 01:18:05,597
Please, Hiyama-san

1274
01:18:06,089 --> 01:18:08,198
Please help us again

1275
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,652
I will return you 100000yen

1276
01:18:10,261 --> 01:18:12,292
This has nothing to do with you people.

1277
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:13,878
I return you!

1278
01:18:14,667 --> 01:18:15,261
Hiyama-san

1279
01:18:16,581 --> 01:18:18,245
If police find this, you're finished, too.

1280
01:18:19,284 --> 01:18:20,659
What can I do for you?

1281
01:18:21,066 --> 01:18:23,159
So we need a way to get rid of this dead body.

1282
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,331
Oh yeah

1283
01:18:26,425 --> 01:18:28,933
You took the sheets of the futon from the storage room.

1284
01:18:29,472 --> 01:18:30,066
What you will do?

1285
01:18:30,323 --> 01:18:32,206
I'm going to weigh down this dead body and sink it.

1286
01:18:32,495 --> 01:18:33,175
What the hell...

1287
01:18:33,722 --> 01:18:35,198
Do it right now

1288
01:18:41,198 --> 01:18:41,941
Ken-Chan

1289
01:18:42,894 --> 01:18:45,847
Miyagawa said to me your girlfriend is beautiful

1290
01:18:47,105 --> 01:18:48,073
Did you meet with Yuko?

1291
01:18:49,269 --> 01:18:53,605
That's why she told me you weren't coming home for a couple of days. And then I made a play where I picked up counterfeit money.

1292
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:56,948
That's strange.
You are kidding

1293
01:18:57,550 --> 01:18:59,386
Eiko was out for her work

1294
01:18:59,495 --> 01:19:03,042
What are you talking about?
She'd been dressed fancy since noon.

1295
01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:05,448
A guy visited her

1296
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:12,963
Director

1297
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:16,151
That madam's patrons are Shinpei Miyagawa and a printer.

1298
01:19:16,238 --> 01:19:16,800
A printer?

1299
01:19:16,839 --> 01:19:17,175

01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:33,636
Yes

1301
01:19:34,206 --> 01:19:34,886
Who is it?

1302
01:19:37,081 --> 01:19:37,777
Who is it?

1303
01:19:38,784 --> 01:19:39,573
It's me

1304
01:19:40,714 --> 01:19:42,206

1305
01:19:46,003 --> 01:19:47,292
What brings you here at this hour?

1306
01:19:49,167 --> 01:19:50,081
What are you doing!

1307
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:59,316
You Still Doubt Me?

1308
01:20:02,386 --> 01:20:05,550
I got a headache at the store.

1309
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:08,214
I left work early and went to bed.

1310
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:11,050
You're gone for a few days.

1311
01:20:11,886 --> 01:20:15,339
And The strange man,Miyagawa comes

1312
01:20:16,175 --> 01:20:20,011
I feel weird, so I locked the door and slept all day

1313
01:20:20,956 --> 01:20:21,558
You are too bad!

1314
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,323
We should return 1 million yen

1315
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:27,425
We still have money.
You return it tomorrow morning

1316
01:20:29,941 --> 01:20:30,730
Hello

1317
01:20:31,113 --> 01:20:32,925
Is Miyagawa here?

1318
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:33,769
Miyagawa?

1319
01:20:34,042 --> 01:20:35,277
Shinpei Miyagawa

01:20:35,448 --> 01:20:36,261
Your husband

1321
01:20:37,214 --> 01:20:39,925
We visited your house, but no one there

1322
01:20:40,613 --> 01:20:42,113
He has not come here

1323
01:20:42,456 --> 01:20:43,777
Oh I see

1324
01:20:50,019 --> 01:20:51,144
Light up

1325
01:20:56,363 --> 01:20:57,534
Did anyone get hurt?

1326
01:20:58,722 --> 01:20:59,432
A customer

1327
01:20:59,472 --> 01:21:00,667
You are closed today?

1328
01:21:01,152 --> 01:21:01,800
Chief

1329
01:21:09,777 --> 01:21:10,784
Sumida,Telephone

1330
01:21:18,714 --> 01:21:21,081
Senda is there?

1331
01:21:21,855 --> 01:21:24,363

1332
01:22:22,183 --> 01:22:22,488

There is no 1 million yen

1335
01:22:35,956 --> 01:22:37,253
No million yen in counterfeit bills.

1336
01:22:37,793 --> 01:22:39,136
Eiko took it by mistake.

1337
01:22:39,988 --> 01:22:41,019
What madam will do?

1338
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:43,738
If she bring it to bank, They will find us

1339
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:46,113
I should stop her somehow

1340
01:23:01,714 --> 01:23:02,753
Hello?

1341
01:23:03,246 --> 01:23:04,683
Are you Kenji Hiyama,right?

1342
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:07,168
Is Ms.Kashiwagi not here?

1343
01:23:07,472 --> 01:23:08,066
No

1344
01:23:10,043 --> 01:23:11,324
Are you off today?

1345
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,612
I'm about  to go

1346
01:23:15,035 --> 01:23:16,386
so excuse me

1347
01:23:31,293 --> 01:23:32,980
I'm Hiyama. Is Kashiwagi in?

1348
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:34,918
She has just left

1349
01:23:35,589 --> 01:23:36,253
Where is Madam?

1350
01:23:36,847 --> 01:23:39,113
She's just gone to the bank

1351
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:40,222
Which bank?

1352
01:23:40,394 --> 01:23:42,058
The Sogo bank in front of station

1353
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:43,793
Thank you

1354
01:23:46,558 --> 01:23:47,753
Welcome

1355
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:50,769
Can I have this and this?

1356
01:23:50,799 --> 01:23:51,409
Yes

1357
01:23:52,160 --> 01:23:53,464
I wonder she has already left

1358
01:23:54,503 --> 01:23:56,128
Or I arrived a little too late

1359
01:23:56,707 --> 01:24:00,074
Or she has not come yet

1360
01:24:35,565 --> 01:24:37,253
What's wrong,Hiyama-san?

1361
01:24:37,285 --> 01:24:39,011
Thank you for taking care of Eiko

1362
01:24:39,550 --> 01:24:41,777
I guess she returned the money this morning

1363
01:24:41,910 --> 01:24:43,026
Yes she returned me for sure

1364
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:44,847
Actually about the money...

1365
01:24:45,558 --> 01:24:49,433
I have new bills today in hopes of making a deal.

1366
01:24:49,488 --> 01:24:51,065
I'm sorry but can you change with his bills?

1367
01:24:51,089 --> 01:24:52,151
I understand

1368
01:24:52,332 --> 01:24:53,668
OK here they are

1369
01:24:54,230 --> 01:24:55,214
Thank you very much

1370
01:24:57,449 --> 01:24:59,714
I didn't intent to kill him.
Trust me

1371
01:25:00,878 --> 01:25:03,527
He got drunk and attacked me first.

1372
01:25:03,730 --> 01:25:05,793
I just pushed him then he fell down

1373
01:25:06,862 --> 01:25:10,292
I'm not lying to you.
I didn't intent to kill him.

1374
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,222
You are stubborn

1375
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:15,128
Elsewhere, you profited from counterfeit money.

1376
01:25:15,214 --> 01:25:15,660
No!

1377
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:17,691
I didn't use the counterfeit money

1378
01:25:17,941 --> 01:25:22,136
Cut it out!
Sumie Higuchi said you made it

1379
01:25:22,418 --> 01:25:25,058
No! I made it but I didn't use it!

1380
01:25:25,183 --> 01:25:26,144
Who used?

1381
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:26,871
Who?

1382
01:25:27,511 --> 01:25:28,691
Tell us who?

1383
01:25:32,839 --> 01:25:34,105
Where have you been?

1384
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,441
I went to buy a cigarette

1385
01:25:35,574 --> 01:25:37,332
I see.
Are you hungry?

1386
01:25:37,363 --> 01:25:38,332
Wait a min

1387
01:25:38,394 --> 01:25:39,441
I won't eat

1388
01:25:40,558 --> 01:25:41,527
Why?

1389
01:25:42,027 --> 01:25:44,144
I need to go to Ito for a important deal

1390
01:25:44,371 --> 01:25:46,582
To Ito? but you can eat some

1391
01:25:46,628 --> 01:25:47,683
No time.

1392
01:25:48,355 --> 01:25:48,988
Hello

1393
01:25:49,558 --> 01:25:49,933
What?

1394
01:25:50,355 --> 01:25:52,566
Does that important transaction take a long time?

1395
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,285
I can finish it within today

1396
01:25:54,769 --> 01:25:57,027
The client is a bicycle racing executive.

1397
01:25:57,386 --> 01:25:59,246
I need to go to see him at racetrack in Ito

1398
01:25:59,597 --> 01:26:00,058
See you

1399
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,527

1400
01:26:01,933 --> 01:26:04,183
Please bring me.
I want to go there

1401
01:26:04,308 --> 01:26:07,433
I can take a break from work at the store.

1402
01:26:07,847 --> 01:26:10,753
I went to Ito the other day.
I loved it.

1403
01:26:11,152 --> 01:26:14,457
I wish I could go there with you

1404
01:26:14,808 --> 01:26:15,980
So Please bring me

1405
01:26:16,300 --> 01:26:17,628
Is that OK?

1406
01:26:18,347 --> 01:26:21,238
That's impossible.
Not today,sorry

1407
01:26:22,081 --> 01:26:23,142
Maybe next time

1408
01:26:23,269 --> 01:26:27,425
Yes.
You don't want me to say this all of a sudden.

1409
01:26:27,847 --> 01:26:29,839
I'm sorry.
Take care

1410
01:26:30,011 --> 01:26:31,371
See you

1411
01:26:32,613 --> 01:26:33,324
Wait

1412
01:26:34,785 --> 01:26:36,222
I will be success in Ito

1413
01:26:37,871 --> 01:26:41,113
After that,I'd rather disappear from Tokyo.

1414
01:26:42,714 --> 01:26:46,996
She wants to go.
It would be good opportunity to travel with Eiko

1415
01:26:49,332 --> 01:26:49,785
OK

1416
01:26:51,933 --> 01:26:52,558
Eiko

1417
01:26:53,121 --> 01:26:54,339
Did you forget something?

1418
01:26:54,364 --> 01:26:56,019
No..
Let's travel

1419
01:26:56,347 --> 01:26:57,027
What?

1420
01:26:57,777 --> 01:27:01,402
I'll be free when my work in Ito is done.
Let's go where you want to go.

1421
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:02,448
Really?

1422
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:03,543
I'm not lying

1423
01:27:03,652 --> 01:27:07,066
I'm very happy.
I have never seen the bicycle race

1424
01:27:07,308 --> 01:27:08,816
I will get ready soon

1425
01:27:08,841 --> 01:27:10,324
But We can't go together

1426
01:27:11,082 --> 01:27:13,230
So let's meet at Ito station 5 pm

1427
01:27:13,846 --> 01:27:15,339
Ok. 5 pm

1428
01:27:15,386 --> 01:27:15,683
Yes

1429
01:27:41,058 --> 01:27:42,339
What the hell?
Let go!

1430
01:27:42,574 --> 01:27:43,175
Let go!

1431
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,613
You are Kenji Hiyama

1432
01:27:47,527 --> 01:27:48,714
This is an arrest warrant.

1433
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,753
Finally it’s last race

1434
01:28:31,863 --> 01:28:34,027
Let's make a lot of money.

1435
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:36,066
Five and three are not the real deal.

1436
01:28:36,581 --> 01:28:38,511
I recommend this driver.

1437
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:40,097
He is capable.

1438
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:42,596
Thank you very much.
Here it is

1439
01:28:54,027 --> 01:28:55,292
I won!

1440
01:29:45,870 --> 01:29:47,183
Hey, Who?

1441
01:29:48,120 --> 01:29:48,652
That man

1442
01:29:50,378 --> 01:29:52,738
Kenichi Ishiwatari.
Stay down!

1443
01:29:54,347 --> 01:29:55,441
Oh damn it!

1444
01:29:55,761 --> 01:29:58,550
Do not touch me!
What are you doing!

1445
01:29:58,667 --> 01:29:59,292
Stay down!

1446
01:30:04,949 --> 01:30:05,972
We are police!

1447
01:30:06,862 --> 01:30:08,089
Get after him!

1448
01:30:09,472 --> 01:30:10,722
Get him!

1449
01:30:21,651 --> 01:30:22,822
Damn it!

1450
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:34,253
They say he's a counterfeiter.

1451
01:30:34,363 --> 01:30:35,167
That CD bill's?

1452
01:30:35,192 --> 01:30:35,870
It seems so

1453
01:30:35,941 --> 01:30:37,105
They are terrible

1454
01:30:37,167 --> 01:30:38,324
Do not push,Do not push

1455
01:30:38,886 --> 01:30:39,824
Come this way

1456
01:30:40,761 --> 01:30:42,245
He is the counterfeiter.

1457
01:30:42,566 --> 01:30:43,675
Oh he is

1458
01:30:44,065 --> 01:30:45,065
Show us your face!

1459
01:30:45,425 --> 01:30:46,722
He is the counterfeiter.

1460
01:30:46,747 --> 01:30:48,159
He is terrible man

1461
01:30:57,714 --> 01:30:58,909
Kenji-san!

1462
01:30:59,605 --> 01:30:59,917
Get in the car

1463
01:31:03,761 --> 01:31:04,683
Kenji-san!

1464
01:31:11,370 --> 01:31:12,870
Wait!

1465
01:31:13,824 --> 01:31:15,089
Kenji-san!

1466

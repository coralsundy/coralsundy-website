00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,742
I used to get into fights when I was a kid.

3
00:00:27,656 --> 00:00:31,422
I didn't like to fight, but I used to get into fights.

4
00:00:41,797 --> 00:00:42,914
Bullshit

5
00:00:48,906 --> 00:00:51,117
I have been popular with women since I was a kid

6
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,164
Really

7
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,203
Girls helped my home work

8
00:00:56,702 --> 00:00:57,382
Here it is

9
00:00:58,867 --> 00:01:02,164
So My grade was bad

10
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:11,851
Sometimes I have a fight for some reason

11
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,945
Hey, go home!

12
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:24,747
There was my mother's grave here three years ago

13
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,325
The grave was destroyed

14
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:32,145
So I got angry

15
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:48,121
A homeless dog

16
00:02:01,942 --> 00:02:04,317
I like that kind of woman

17
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:09,364
I don't have a house so I think it's better to be on the side of my favorite girl

18
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,481
Do you get it?

19
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:16,356
Both me and you are the flowers of the Tone River

20
00:03:19,989 --> 00:03:23,372
I'll iron your pants

21
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,840
So give me

22
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:26,997
Wait, does it cost a lot?

23
00:03:27,255 --> 00:03:29,005
It's free of charge

24
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:30,622
Free? then thank you

25
00:03:31,786 --> 00:03:36,746
We do not charge anything other than room rates

26
00:03:36,771 --> 00:03:37,505
I see

27
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,793
So this is free too?

28
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:42,160
I'm kidding

29
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:46,223
Please polish my shoes, prepare a toothbrush, and wash my clothes.

30
00:03:46,575 --> 00:03:47,590
Did your clothes tear?

31
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,708
When I fell, my clothes broke a little

32
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,426
Don't look my cock

33
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,325
Don't be upset

34
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,911
Your angry face is cute

35
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,591
You look just like my dead sister

36
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:02,481
Did your sister die?

37
00:04:02,551 --> 00:04:04,012
I was kidding, I have no sister

38
00:04:05,083 --> 00:04:07,598
Towel and soap will be in the bathroom

39
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:08,458
Thanks

40
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:17,903
Damn it

41
00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,364
Who broke my mother's grave and built a ranch

42
00:04:23,755 --> 00:04:25,387
Stop it

43
00:04:26,848 --> 00:04:27,778
Stop it

44
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,325
They fight, don't they?

45
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:36,286
What's wrong?

46
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:41,958
Wait wait wait!

47
00:04:42,286 --> 00:04:44,481
Wait, not here

48
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:45,942
What the hell?

49
00:04:46,091 --> 00:04:48,161
What's wrong?

50
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,044
Wait

51
00:04:55,755 --> 00:04:56,512
What the hell?

52
00:04:57,059 --> 00:04:58,434
We've been together so long.

53
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,535
I can't do that

54
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,200
Wait!

55
00:05:03,225 --> 00:05:05,348
Don't get involved with them

56
00:05:07,426 --> 00:05:09,442
Stop it please

57
00:05:09,864 --> 00:05:11,505
Stop it

58
00:05:11,989 --> 00:05:14,739
It's not fair to attack one woman with a bunch of men.

59
00:05:16,294 --> 00:05:17,880
What the hell?

60
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,192
Run away

61
00:05:19,825 --> 00:05:21,458
Don't touch her

62
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,903
I'm not taking to you

63
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:25,934
Don't touch her

64
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,520
I protect her

65
00:05:28,841 --> 00:05:30,387
It's none of your business

66
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:32,466
Can you kill me with this?

67
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,387
It's dangerous to have this

68
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:37,708
Hey, bring him

69
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:40,466
Run away

70
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:42,895
Stay down

71
00:05:43,942 --> 00:05:45,801
Don't let you guys pass here

72
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:48,294
Hey he has escaped

73
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:49,176
Follow him

74
00:05:49,903 --> 00:05:53,801
That woman is in the house

75
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:08,155
The group you just saw are from the Daiko team

76
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,366
Kobe's?

77
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:12,061
They are growing in power

78
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:16,936
They got into a fight with the locals last year when they smashed up a tomb and built a golf course.

79
00:06:17,132 --> 00:06:18,046
They did it?

80
00:06:18,436 --> 00:06:20,522
Ok, I get angry

81
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:23,287
Wait, they are dangerous

82
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,796
Oh fire

83
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:26,796
fire

84
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,163
I don't care

85
00:06:28,444 --> 00:06:29,475
Wait

86
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:30,554
Let me go

87
00:06:39,944 --> 00:06:41,132
Wait!

88
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:47,280
Where is the fire going?

89
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:48,483
cabaret Takamatsu is burning

90
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,296
Oh I see

91
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,787
Beware of fire

92
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,397
He is the manager of yesterday's fire cabaret Takamatsu

93
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,460
He feels responsible and wanted to commit suicide

94
00:07:31,897 --> 00:07:32,819
Thanks for last night

95
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:34,835
You've got the wrong guy.

96
00:07:35,749 --> 00:07:37,999
Our president is very pleased

97
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:38,983
Your president?

98
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,382
I have nothing to do with him

99
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,538
Please go downstairs

100
00:07:44,694 --> 00:07:47,233
He wants to thank you

101
00:07:47,804 --> 00:07:49,257
He misunderstands something

102
00:07:50,171 --> 00:07:52,835
I'm handsome, so I know he won't make a mistake.

103
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,507
You have a nice car

104
00:08:08,179 --> 00:08:09,350
He's the president?

105
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:10,014
Yes

106
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:13,014
You want to thank me

107
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:14,108
For last night

108
00:08:14,397 --> 00:08:15,139
For last night?

109
00:08:16,054 --> 00:08:20,147
I got into a fight last night, but I didn't see you guys.

110
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,077
Are you executives of Daiko team?

111
00:08:23,827 --> 00:08:24,968
Oh I get it

112
00:08:26,397 --> 00:08:29,749
They are our enemies

113
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:32,975
What the hell?

114
00:08:33,374 --> 00:08:34,741
I'll give you cigarette money

115
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,327
I'll give you

116
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:39,827
What's this

117
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,163
For your tobacco money

118
00:08:42,304 --> 00:08:44,132
I can buy a lot of cigarettes with this money

119
00:08:44,897 --> 00:08:46,818
Why do you know my name?

120
00:08:46,936 --> 00:08:48,507
I have many fake names

121
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,929
I don't usually use my real name

122
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:53,741
You checked the lodging note

123
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:54,686
That's right

124
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:55,944
You also stayed there

125
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:56,647
Yes

126
00:08:57,022 --> 00:09:02,725
You misunderstood something and got into a fight with the Daiko team

127
00:09:03,054 --> 00:09:05,046
Don't say bullshit

128
00:09:05,522 --> 00:09:08,835
I just wanted to protect that woman

129
00:09:09,522 --> 00:09:12,561
Later I heard they broke the grave

130
00:09:13,147 --> 00:09:15,499
That woman was Daiko team's spy

131
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,421
What?

132
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:20,429
They aimed us

133
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:22,913
That woman was looking for out room

134
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:26,272
At first I thought you were their companion

135
00:09:26,647 --> 00:09:28,218
Then we checked the lodging note

136
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:29,952
I see

137
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:32,288
What's your name?

138
00:09:40,757 --> 00:09:43,061
Goro Numano of Numano Tourism Co., Ltd.

139
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,577
This business card costs 5 yen per sheet.

140
00:09:46,014 --> 00:09:46,600
I return this

141
00:09:47,116 --> 00:09:48,335
You don't receive his busyness card?

142
00:09:48,647 --> 00:09:51,389
It's a waste because it costs 5 yen per sheet.

143
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:52,694
I hate business cards

144
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,897
You are a wealthy man, right?

145
00:09:55,741 --> 00:09:57,366
I already remember your information

146
00:09:58,124 --> 00:10:00,944
Kita in Osaka City is Yaku Toko Building Room 305

147
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:02,796
Phone numbers are 341-2852

148
00:10:03,288 --> 00:10:04,546
I have a high memory

149
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:06,796
I still have my other skills.

150
00:10:07,608 --> 00:10:10,124
This money is enough for one cigarette

151
00:10:11,218 --> 00:10:13,468
I'll give you another cigaret

152
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,046
Keep the money

153
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,186
You guys are better than me

154
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:26,632
But I'm sure I'm more handsome than you guys

155
00:10:59,546 --> 00:11:00,530
This is not a taxi

156
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:02,897
He is the vice president of our company

157
00:11:03,554 --> 00:11:04,460
He is the vice president of your company?

158
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:38,218
Oh Kobe,
get me off here

159
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,468
This is the fee

160
00:11:42,694 --> 00:11:43,585
Let me go

161
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:48,287
They broke my mother's grave and built a golf course.
I'm going to complain to them

162
00:11:48,561 --> 00:11:50,952
You can't go in there alone.

163
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,507
I think I can

164
00:11:54,202 --> 00:11:55,647
I have lived on my own

165
00:11:56,241 --> 00:11:59,093
You killed one of them

166
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:02,147
He dead?

167
00:12:02,623 --> 00:12:06,420
You should wait in Osaka until everything settles down

168
00:12:06,952 --> 00:12:07,694
I return this

169
00:12:19,491 --> 00:12:20,960
Where are we going?

170
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,132
Nothing special

171
00:12:22,421 --> 00:12:24,390
We are just walking around?

172
00:12:24,819 --> 00:12:25,811
I'm introducing you to everyone.

173
00:12:26,116 --> 00:12:26,835
What?

174
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:28,593
I'm not Geisha girl

175
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,897
Shall we go back to company?

176
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:33,546
Everyone is there

177
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,647
What's wrong?

178
00:13:22,561 --> 00:13:24,069
You are the man in Kyoto

179
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,679
You are the man in Minami

180
00:13:27,976 --> 00:13:30,374
Do you know them

181
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:34,179
I got to know him a month ago through a friend's introduction

182
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:39,577
He went away a month ago with a big mouth.

183
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:42,390
He is a rumored man who killed a person

184
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:44,030
I'm not

185
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:45,265
Have a seat

186
00:13:45,765 --> 00:13:46,171
Thanks

187
00:13:46,374 --> 00:13:46,968
Have a seat

188
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,882
I'll sit here

189
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,226
Let me bid

190
00:14:05,561 --> 00:14:07,116
You're betting a lot of money.

191
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:08,640
Take a bid

192
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,452
Take a bid

193
00:14:35,671 --> 00:14:37,429
I lost

194
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,069
Work hard from tomorrow

195
00:14:41,272 --> 00:14:46,092
I know.
I have to work because I don't have money

196
00:14:48,343 --> 00:14:48,983
See you

197
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:11,288
Use this

198
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,085
Thanks

199
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:20,311
Oh it's hot!

200
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:22,538
This is hot water, so it's hot

201
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:23,843
Did you boil?

202
00:15:24,515 --> 00:15:28,936
Hot water is boiling all day in here

203
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,304
Because it is the latest technology now

204
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,358
I see

205
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,499
That's fine

206
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,499
Have you never stayed at this hotel?

207
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:49,413
I have only stayed at a first-class hotel

208
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:53,155
The hotel here is a cheap hotel

209
00:15:53,882 --> 00:15:55,726
You are good at kidding

210
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,288
This is an old hotel

211
00:15:58,569 --> 00:16:02,296
It seems that it will take 5 years to recover this construction cost

212
00:16:02,741 --> 00:16:06,257
The building looks cheap and the service is simple.

213
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,163
It seems that those sweets are purchased cheaply

214
00:16:09,413 --> 00:16:12,811
Our salary is also cheap

215
00:16:13,194 --> 00:16:16,280
You had better not work here

216
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:19,304
I'm thinking of quitting this job but

217
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,632
You are here now, so I'm thinking of working here little more

218
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:24,390
You like me?

219
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,499
You are cute

220
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,304
You look like my dead lover

221
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:33,390
Did your lover die?

222
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:39,935
She held my hand and died on a snowy night

223
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,679
Does she look like me?

224
00:16:42,704 --> 00:16:44,561
Your eyes look exactly like

225
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:48,788
Love me as a substitute for that dead lover

226
00:16:48,813 --> 00:16:53,382
I'm a homeless dog so I don't know when I will disappear

227
00:16:53,522 --> 00:16:54,538
I don't care

228
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:59,601
Passion is something that burns temporarily

229
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:00,921
Quickly?

230
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:05,607
Let me think for a moment

231
00:17:08,022 --> 00:17:10,999
Passion is something that burns temporarily

232
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,163
OK I get it

233
00:17:13,577 --> 00:17:17,921
I will definitely go the way I have decided

234
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,022
Are you virgin?

235
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:24,538
I'm going to be hated later.

236
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,476
I'm a virgin but don't look down

237
00:17:32,233 --> 00:17:33,538
It hurts

238
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,506
What?

239
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:42,022
Nothing

240
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:45,335
You know what

241
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,460
Hello? yes, the bath has been fixed

242
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:00,999
Yes

243
00:18:02,585 --> 00:18:03,577
What's wrong?

244
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,396
From our guest

245
00:18:05,553 --> 00:18:06,335
I see

246
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:07,881
It can't be helped

247
00:18:13,186 --> 00:18:13,991
Welcome

248
00:18:22,131 --> 00:18:24,545
Please collect money through the back door.

249
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:27,210
We'll have visitors here.

250
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:31,639
Gas prices here are cheap.

251
00:18:32,053 --> 00:18:34,967
The bath is heated by oil.

252
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,811
Thanks

253
00:18:50,092 --> 00:18:52,116
Did you get the full amount of insurance money?

254
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,100
Who are you?

255
00:18:57,811 --> 00:18:58,827
I'm your body guard

256
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:04,616
So the boss hired you to make sure I didn't run off with the
money.

257
00:19:05,374 --> 00:19:09,046
The boss didn't hire me.
I'm doing this on my own

258
00:19:09,077 --> 00:19:12,342
You stupid.
I don't need any guards

259
00:19:42,756 --> 00:19:43,381
Hi!

260
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,475
Hi, wait

261
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:52,280
Hey

262
00:19:52,694 --> 00:19:53,342
What?

263
00:19:54,655 --> 00:19:56,631
Don't follow her

264
00:19:57,178 --> 00:19:58,256
It's none of your business

265
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:00,233
Don't chase me

266
00:20:02,944 --> 00:20:05,647
Hi, don't run away

267
00:20:10,764 --> 00:20:15,475
What's wrong?
I'm sorry about the other night.

268
00:20:16,397 --> 00:20:17,858
Talk to me something

269
00:20:19,921 --> 00:20:22,913
You are boring,
Say something

270
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:25,538
What's your name?

271
00:20:25,944 --> 00:20:28,061
I'm Daisuke Kamoi

272
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,577
hat's your name?

273
00:20:31,014 --> 00:20:31,522
Karasawa

274
00:20:32,796 --> 00:20:33,397
Asako

275
00:20:33,835 --> 00:20:34,452
Asako?

276
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,522
You have a good name.
Your name means morning?

277
00:20:39,928 --> 00:20:42,967
I hear you have something to do with Daiko team

278
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:44,850
Is that right?

279
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:48,100
I have nothing to do with them

280
00:20:48,421 --> 00:20:49,811
Why you were in Shikoku?

281
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:52,264
Where do you live?

282
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,975
I can guess you live around here

283
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:57,874
Right?

284
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,913
It seems you are on the way of going home

285
00:21:02,772 --> 00:21:04,108
Do you work at Bar or cabaret?

286
00:21:04,741 --> 00:21:05,514
Or club?

287
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,116
No, let me go

288
00:21:09,897 --> 00:21:11,694
What do you do for living?

289
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:16,202
I believe you have something to do with Daiko
team

290
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:18,678
They control you?

291
00:21:21,264 --> 00:21:26,358
I will support you if so

292
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,936
That's what I thought

293
00:21:46,225 --> 00:21:46,983
And

294
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:49,897
Wait!

295
00:21:51,131 --> 00:21:52,116
You've drop something

296
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:53,663
Get out of my way

297
00:21:53,811 --> 00:21:55,624
I believe you have something to do with Daiko
team

298
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,530
We can talk about Daiko

299
00:21:58,555 --> 00:22:01,342
Shut up,
I don't want to talk with you

300
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:04,975
I think I'm more handsome than you

301
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,546
You are boring

302
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:08,866
Wait

303
00:22:09,514 --> 00:22:10,725
What the hell?

304
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,881
Just do your job.

305
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:17,928
And keep your eyes on the insurance money

306
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:21,288
Don't chase her.
Otherwise you will go to death

307
00:22:21,678 --> 00:22:23,147
I don't care about my life

308
00:22:23,172 --> 00:22:26,944
Your life is worthless.

309
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:28,874
What the hell?

310
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:32,655
You don't have to give the money to Daiko

311
00:22:33,796 --> 00:22:36,444
In any case, they take the money

312
00:22:39,022 --> 00:22:42,022
I will visit you later for fire

313
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:43,444
For fire?

314
00:22:48,616 --> 00:22:50,155
He's so nasty

315
00:22:58,397 --> 00:22:59,928
Bar No.8

316
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:06,585
Did you get the insurance money?

317
00:23:06,647 --> 00:23:10,654
Yes let's share.
100 for Oba team, 150 for Shindaku

318
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,756
50 for Numahachi

319
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,983
150 for Tomita

320
00:23:17,483 --> 00:23:18,952
450 in total

321
00:23:19,366 --> 00:23:20,592
You get it?

322
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:33,038
Hello? Shindaku?

323
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:34,085
I'm Numano

324
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:35,702
Is your boss there?

325
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:38,225
I'm Numano

326
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:42,780
I've asked our subordinate to bring there the 150

327
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:44,788
You can pay me back later with interest.

328
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,428
Yes 30%

329
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,413
What? 20%, No way

330
00:23:51,085 --> 00:23:52,671
Don't make fun of me

331
00:23:53,069 --> 00:23:55,467
I worked hard for the money

332
00:23:56,858 --> 00:23:59,139
30% interest, 3 months for the limit

333
00:23:59,561 --> 00:24:00,796
Yes 3 months

334
00:24:02,397 --> 00:24:05,514
You guys can make a profit of 3 million yen a month with that money.

335
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:07,600
Anyway

336
00:24:08,022 --> 00:24:12,288
Money is needed to crush the Daiko group golf course

337
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:18,514
We need government support

338
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,217
To get a loan from the government, We have to make an effort.

339
00:24:22,811 --> 00:24:26,037
I'm counting on you.
30% interest, 3 months for the limit

340
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:30,209
This person is really serious

341
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,905
He works hard

342
00:24:32,303 --> 00:24:34,061
He works hard wherever he goes

343
00:24:34,577 --> 00:24:38,952
I want to sign a contract with Suzuki Tourism Office on the 3rd floor of the North Building

344
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,295
Boss

345
00:24:46,577 --> 00:24:48,717
I gave the money to Oba and Shinraku

346
00:24:49,147 --> 00:24:50,444
Give me the receipt

347
00:24:58,342 --> 00:25:01,335
You need 24 prefabricated beds

348
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:04,835
24 sets of tables and chairs

349
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:06,772
When can you deliver?

350
00:25:07,186 --> 00:25:09,647
About 1 week

351
00:25:09,944 --> 00:25:10,928
5 days OK?

352
00:25:12,163 --> 00:25:12,834
5 days?

353
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:17,592
We also want a lighting fixture and a luxurious stand

354
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,749
This is also 24 sets

355
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:23,756
Okay, We'll get it right away

356
00:25:24,139 --> 00:25:24,975
In 5 days please

357
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:25,741
We are in hurry

358
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:29,881
We will prepare them within 5 days

359
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:31,256
Thanks

360
00:25:31,561 --> 00:25:33,202
Thank you for your order

361
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:34,990
Thanks

362
00:25:35,795 --> 00:25:36,928
See you

363
00:25:39,272 --> 00:25:40,881
Say hi to your boss

364
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:47,350
5 days

365
00:25:48,842 --> 00:25:52,756
We will cancel the Atsugi Building on the north side on the 6th day.

366
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:53,702
OK?

367
00:25:54,975 --> 00:25:57,795
Today is the 12th, so it will be canceled on the 18th.

368
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:01,811
I don't know what kind of work the company here does

369
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,194
You run love hotel

370
00:26:04,483 --> 00:26:06,045
You guys also do loan sharks

371
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,866
You also broker furniture.

372
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:11,670
It ’s the same mysterious as you.

373
00:26:11,772 --> 00:26:13,655
What? I gave you the receipt

374
00:26:13,811 --> 00:26:15,420
I'm not talking about the recipe

375
00:26:15,514 --> 00:26:17,780
You dropped something before

376
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,108
It's none of your business

377
00:26:21,202 --> 00:26:22,038
Show me

378
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:27,866
Oh

379
00:26:28,835 --> 00:26:29,405
You made this?

380
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:32,201
Yes I made it

381
00:26:32,553 --> 00:26:33,381
I like this too

382
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,795
The performance is twice that of a normal pistol.

383
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:38,499
This is my most prized possession.

384
00:26:46,827 --> 00:26:47,608
What do you think?

385
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:50,795
This is so cool

386
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,053
This is real

387
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:00,397
This is automatic pistol

388
00:27:01,670 --> 00:27:02,717
Do you want to shoot?

389
00:27:03,374 --> 00:27:04,030
Shoot someone?

390
00:27:04,577 --> 00:27:05,350
No way

391
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:08,045
You can use this in the town

392
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:09,732
I'll bring you somewhere

393
00:27:10,154 --> 00:27:11,764
I'm excited

394
00:27:12,155 --> 00:27:13,194
My pee leaked

395
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:14,592
You look so excited

396
00:27:14,625 --> 00:27:16,936
Which do you like most girl and pistol?

397
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:18,163
girl and pistol?

398
00:27:19,163 --> 00:27:21,374
I like both

399
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:06,608
Kamoi

400
00:28:07,069 --> 00:28:08,967
I hate this pistol

401
00:28:09,147 --> 00:28:12,389
Your name sounds like a bird. That's why it's not good.

402
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:13,788
It's none of my business

403
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:15,569
My name has been this way for generations.

404
00:28:33,202 --> 00:28:34,936
I was getting better

405
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:38,491
At first he was good, but at the end I was better

406
00:28:38,858 --> 00:28:41,131
I refreshed my feeling

407
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,170
You played a good match with him, isn't it?

408
00:28:50,725 --> 00:28:51,327
Aoi

409
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:52,874
What can I do for you?

410
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:56,280
You didn't work properly

411
00:28:57,045 --> 00:28:58,905
Don't get in the way of my work

412
00:28:59,186 --> 00:29:02,663
I just want you to keep our promise

413
00:29:02,688 --> 00:29:04,053
I gave the money

414
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:07,264
This is not enough

415
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:09,350
Don't give me shit

416
00:29:10,944 --> 00:29:14,710
Hey guys, go back work

417
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:18,889
kamisawa,
Have you seen a new store?

418
00:29:19,663 --> 00:29:20,217
I am going to see from now on

419
00:29:20,444 --> 00:29:21,085
You go now

420
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:36,092
Take this

421
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:42,116
Hey Aoi,
We have to pretend that you and I are not on good terms

422
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:44,624
They find that we are working together

423
00:29:44,764 --> 00:29:46,592
Yes,that's right

424
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,983
If they find out, we're in trouble.

425
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,327
We will set fire tonight

426
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,366
Tonight?

427
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59,663
It's too early

428
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,022
I don't think so

429
00:31:04,983 --> 00:31:05,913
Fire!

430
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:07,030
Really?

431
00:31:23,999 --> 00:31:24,967
Run away!

432
00:31:27,491 --> 00:31:28,655
Run away!

433
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:30,287
My stuff is here

434
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:32,413
Where should I run away?

435
00:31:33,585 --> 00:31:34,811
Run away!

436
00:31:39,624 --> 00:31:42,006
My hand bag is there

437
00:31:43,686 --> 00:31:44,561
Forget it

438
00:31:44,586 --> 00:31:45,295
Let's go

439
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,764
What can we do?

440
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:57,022
It's burning well

441
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,772
I forgot to take my watch

442
00:32:01,639 --> 00:32:03,631
My neck less is there

443
00:32:04,444 --> 00:32:06,358
You are Manager!

444
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,139
You take responsibility

445
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:11,303
You were dead if we didn't guide you

446
00:32:23,553 --> 00:32:24,249
Hey

447
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,116
Look this

448
00:32:29,491 --> 00:32:31,311
I told you to visit

449
00:32:31,336 --> 00:32:33,928
You are a marauder

450
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:34,881
Get out

451
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:37,897
It's messed up by fire extinguishing work

452
00:32:38,341 --> 00:32:39,662
Are the guests okay?

453
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:40,905
Don't ask me

454
00:32:41,069 --> 00:32:42,553
Our president took care of them

455
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:46,311
I didn't expect him to set fire

456
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:52,795
What the guest left behind was a handbag for the wristwatch spare.

457
00:32:54,444 --> 00:32:56,936
Then it's nonflammable

458
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,849
This canned food is okay

459
00:33:04,835 --> 00:33:08,694
All the things left behind by the guests are okay

460
00:33:09,124 --> 00:33:10,241
Who are you?

461
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:11,983
Police?

462
00:33:12,444 --> 00:33:18,272
The firepower was strong, but the building's walls are very thin.

463
00:33:18,506 --> 00:33:20,116
It was quick to extinguish the fire

464
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,811
I'm asking Who are you?

465
00:33:23,241 --> 00:33:25,374
I told you I'm your guard

466
00:33:26,186 --> 00:33:26,975
Why you know my name?

467
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:29,670
You checked my identify?

468
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:30,569
Are you from Shikoku?

469
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:31,436
Shikoku?

470
00:33:33,085 --> 00:33:34,233
Why you ask me?

471
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:36,272
It's none of your business

472
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:37,397
What?

473
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:41,389
What is the cause of this fire?

474
00:33:41,952 --> 00:33:42,616
It was a misfire

475
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:45,217
Police and fire department announced so

476
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:47,881
The Insurance money was paid

477
00:33:48,131 --> 00:33:49,186
I don't know

478
00:33:49,335 --> 00:33:53,358
Even if the insurance pays out, the president will just shake his profits and I won't get any money.

479
00:33:54,608 --> 00:33:56,264
I see,
It was a misfire

480
00:33:57,249 --> 00:34:00,366
There's been a recent dispute between the police and the fire department.

481
00:34:00,717 --> 00:34:02,186
It was a misfire

482
00:34:03,163 --> 00:34:04,092
That's good for you

483
00:34:21,038 --> 00:34:22,163
Who is he?

484
00:34:23,249 --> 00:34:25,264
He's so nasty

485
00:34:39,913 --> 00:34:43,326
I'm sorry, president

486
00:34:43,749 --> 00:34:46,999
When I went to the North Building, Mr. Suzuki wasn't there.

487
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:53,849
Please pay 1.6 million yen

488
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:54,928
Please

489
00:34:55,319 --> 00:34:57,163
It's none of my business

490
00:34:57,592 --> 00:35:01,202
He spoofed my name

491
00:35:01,569 --> 00:35:03,006
I know nothing

492
00:35:03,545 --> 00:35:07,100
Please complain to Mr. Aoi Kiroku

493
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:09,123
Don't say that

494
00:35:09,553 --> 00:35:11,912
I'm counting on you

495
00:35:12,038 --> 00:35:12,811
Shut up!

496
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,397
It's none of my business

497
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:21,131
You should talk with Aoi.
Don't come here anymore

498
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:23,092
Hey

499
00:35:36,905 --> 00:35:40,233
I see.
Aoi set the fire

500
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:44,764
Yes,
He ran away with 42 million insurance money

501
00:35:45,756 --> 00:35:46,710
Set fire

502
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:50,827
I see.
So the fire spread quickly

503
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,210
You should find him

504
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:58,030
I can't chase him because I don't know where he is

505
00:35:58,718 --> 00:36:00,874
Where is he?

506
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:04,671
He is in Daiko group in Kobe

507
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:06,835
Daiko?

508
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:09,655
He's in Daiko?

509
00:36:11,796 --> 00:36:13,733
He was in contact with the Daiko group

510
00:36:14,405 --> 00:36:18,069
I finally found out that he had a lot to do with the group

511
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:22,155
I hear you do a good job

512
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:27,467
That's why I hid the fact that you had a history of murder.

513
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,764
So I'm counting on you

514
00:36:32,202 --> 00:36:32,905
No way

515
00:36:34,491 --> 00:36:36,811
I don't want to obey your orders

516
00:36:37,991 --> 00:36:41,866
I can quit this job

517
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:43,405
What? you don't?

518
00:36:43,632 --> 00:36:44,296
No

519
00:36:44,788 --> 00:36:48,022
I have already given you money

520
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:48,686
Money?

521
00:36:48,944 --> 00:36:52,468
It looks like I got married to this company

522
00:36:53,194 --> 00:36:55,608
Do you think you got the money for free?

523
00:36:55,804 --> 00:36:58,194
Don't talk about money

524
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,835
That money was taken by fraudulent means, right?

525
00:37:01,007 --> 00:37:01,725
What did you say?

526
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,327
You hit me

527
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:07,577
Hit me more

528
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:09,335
You hit me for 50,000 yen at a time

529
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:11,975
You hit me for 300,000 yen at 6 time

530
00:37:12,468 --> 00:37:14,022
That will be fair

531
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:15,975
Hit me

532
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,014
You hit me for 50,000 yen at a time

533
00:37:20,546 --> 00:37:22,999
You don't want to pay

534
00:37:23,468 --> 00:37:24,561
You are stingy

535
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:27,757
50,000

536
00:37:29,741 --> 00:37:30,593
100,000

537
00:37:32,171 --> 00:37:33,124
150,000

538
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:34,944
200,000

539
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,483
250,000

540
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:38,897
300,000

541
00:37:41,834 --> 00:37:44,584
Good, I'll return some

542
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:45,632
50,000

543
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,850
100,000

544
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:51,054
150,000

545
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:52,202
200,000

546
00:37:52,452 --> 00:37:53,639
250,000

547
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:55,968
Damn it

548
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,249
Fuck you

549
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:01,701
I'll stop.
It's waste money

550
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:04,381
My debt is 250,000

551
00:38:05,514 --> 00:38:09,452
I have nothing to do with you anymore

552
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:10,866
OK?

553
00:38:14,186 --> 00:38:15,179
Where are you going?

554
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:17,397
It's none of your business

555
00:38:18,194 --> 00:38:20,210
I'll go wherever I want

556
00:38:25,655 --> 00:38:27,843
The woman had this lighter

557
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:34,022
This lighter was given to a customer to commemorate the opening of the store last year.

558
00:38:34,335 --> 00:38:36,225
Who in the Daiko Group did you give this ?

559
00:38:37,327 --> 00:38:41,389
I think this indirectly passed to the Daiko group

560
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,397
I get it

561
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:46,436
Wait

562
00:38:47,006 --> 00:38:49,264
You can stay upstairs

563
00:38:49,999 --> 00:38:51,718
You like caring

564
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:54,429
I will come again when I feel like it

565
00:39:07,225 --> 00:39:10,858
Mr. Numano is smart but sometimes makes mistakes

566
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:13,287
He believed in you

567
00:39:13,335 --> 00:39:15,249
I was also worried

568
00:39:16,663 --> 00:39:18,694
I thought he found me

569
00:39:19,538 --> 00:39:24,951
Because he is the chairman of the Osaka group

570
00:39:26,483 --> 00:39:28,530
So what will we do?

571
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:33,100
Do we wait here until we settle down and then go to Okayama?

572
00:39:33,843 --> 00:39:35,444
Or Kyushu?

573
00:39:36,733 --> 00:39:40,725
We'll be safe if we stay with the captain.

574
00:39:42,243 --> 00:39:47,868
I'm running away with 4 million yen.
Numano must chase me

575
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:51,063
So in the end

576
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,320
We'll kill Numano?

577
00:39:58,688 --> 00:39:59,360
Aoi?

578
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,485
It's better not to kill Numano now

579
00:40:03,976 --> 00:40:08,890
If we kill him now, we'll be in trouble.

580
00:40:09,242 --> 00:40:10,086
So

581
00:40:11,796 --> 00:40:13,234
I'll kill time here

582
00:40:14,046 --> 00:40:15,617
Don't worry about women and alcohol

583
00:40:16,156 --> 00:40:20,156
There is a guy who do a good job with my subordinates

584
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:28,632
What?

585
00:40:41,671 --> 00:40:42,445
What's wrong?

586
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:47,296
Kamoi in the Numano group has been missing

587
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:48,757
Kamoi?

588
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:51,179
I see

589
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,281
Numano asked him to find me

590
00:41:01,093 --> 00:41:02,906
Let's play

591
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:04,062
Sure

592
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:06,156
Red

593
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,398
I lost

594
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:09,819
You are so lucky

595
00:41:09,844 --> 00:41:10,882
Take off your underwear

596
00:41:11,695 --> 00:41:13,586
You take his underwear too

597
00:41:14,781 --> 00:41:18,632
Can I give you the elastic band of my underwear?

598
00:41:19,179 --> 00:41:20,461
Are you crazy?

599
00:41:21,257 --> 00:41:24,492
I don't need your dirty underwear.
I'll return you all

600
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,164
Are you sure?

601
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:28,570
I'm just killing time here

602
00:41:29,632 --> 00:41:32,890
Don't catch a cold

603
00:41:38,367 --> 00:41:38,796
Hey

604
00:41:42,328 --> 00:41:46,937
Do you know any good business?
I have 200,000

605
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,539
200,000?

606
00:41:49,421 --> 00:41:50,945
It's a lot

607
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:54,414
How about smuggling Western liquor?

608
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:55,718
smuggling Western liquor?

609
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:59,437
I hate being ordered by someone

610
00:41:59,484 --> 00:42:00,937
No one order you

611
00:42:01,773 --> 00:42:08,593
You enter a foreign ship in the port, negotiate and buy with it

612
00:42:09,148 --> 00:42:10,453
That's interesting

613
00:42:10,945 --> 00:42:12,273
Do I use any special boat?

614
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,421
You don't have to use that

615
00:42:14,757 --> 00:42:17,687
If you do that, the police will find you

616
00:42:18,492 --> 00:42:19,952
You go there by swimming

617
00:42:19,993 --> 00:42:20,616
by swimming?

618
00:42:21,046 --> 00:42:22,617
Yes by swimming

619
00:42:23,429 --> 00:42:24,906
You can't swim?

620
00:42:24,984 --> 00:42:27,406
I can swim, but

621
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:29,914
I can't make this wet

622
00:42:31,273 --> 00:42:33,086
You have a  pistol

623
00:42:33,111 --> 00:42:35,601
I cherish this

624
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:36,429
Are you good at shooting?

625
00:42:36,562 --> 00:42:37,992
I'm expert

626
00:42:38,312 --> 00:42:40,898
You should go to the Olympics

627
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:41,664
go to the Olympics?

628
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,375
I have no fixed address, so I can't

629
00:42:43,734 --> 00:42:44,718
I see

630
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:48,000
Don't tell anyone I have a pistol

631
00:42:48,025 --> 00:42:49,007
I know

632
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:55,705
You

633
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:02,017
I'm arresting you for illegal gun possession.

634
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:03,384
You are police!

635
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:14,088
Don't move!

636
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,071
Freeze!

637
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:22,728
Ouch!

638
00:43:22,861 --> 00:43:24,595
Help me

639
00:43:25,283 --> 00:43:26,892
Thanks, bill is there

640
00:43:27,002 --> 00:43:28,525
Thank you

641
00:43:34,033 --> 00:43:35,728
Where did you hide the gun?

642
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:38,947
Pistol?
I don't know what are you talking about

643
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:40,783
What is that?

644
00:43:42,658 --> 00:43:43,970
I saw it

645
00:43:44,494 --> 00:43:45,369
I see

646
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,025
Are you really police?

647
00:43:49,322 --> 00:43:51,877
Why you don't bring me to police station?

648
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,931
You are not, right?

649
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,720
What are you doing?
I'm hungry

650
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,103
I won't treat this meal.
I know you have no money

651
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,861
If you don't pay me, I'll bring you in for eating and drinking without
paying.

652
00:44:05,197 --> 00:44:05,994
What the hell!

653
00:44:06,361 --> 00:44:10,548
You've brought me here.
You should treat me to this noddle

654
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:14,533
It's not free!

655
00:44:17,713 --> 00:44:20,556
You are good at joking

656
00:44:29,681 --> 00:44:32,369
Do you want to live with me?

657
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,158
I can't live with a police

658
00:44:36,556 --> 00:44:39,205
And I like this homeless life

659
00:44:42,486 --> 00:44:43,673
Why you are in Kobe?

660
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:45,619
Take a guess.

661
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:53,314
Because of that woman and Daiko group who broke your mother's grave

662
00:44:55,939 --> 00:44:57,423
Why you know that?

663
00:44:57,627 --> 00:44:58,931
I've looked up everything

664
00:45:01,103 --> 00:45:04,666
Shall I tell you where that woman is?

665
00:45:06,048 --> 00:45:07,252
Tell me

666
00:45:08,892 --> 00:45:10,767
Can I ask you something if I tell it?

667
00:45:11,306 --> 00:45:12,095
What's that?

668
00:45:12,767 --> 00:45:16,033
Sure if I could help it

669
00:45:24,345 --> 00:45:25,400
What the hell?

670
00:45:27,564 --> 00:45:30,572
Watch on Numano and Aoi

671
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:36,119
Aoi has taken Numano's insurance money and run away

672
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:39,088
That's what I thought

673
00:45:42,931 --> 00:45:46,478
You are here because Numano ask you to find Aoi

674
00:45:46,697 --> 00:45:47,548
No way

675
00:45:47,869 --> 00:45:49,416
I'm not looking for Aoi

676
00:45:49,673 --> 00:45:50,705
You should find him

677
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:51,962
No way

678
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,798
I have a grudge against the DAIKO group, but not against Aoi.

679
00:46:00,994 --> 00:46:01,916
I see

680
00:46:03,509 --> 00:46:04,423
You won't find him

681
00:46:06,361 --> 00:46:07,947
So I won't tell where that woman is

682
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,681
I'll find her by myself

683
00:46:13,455 --> 00:46:15,338
You can't find her

684
00:46:18,103 --> 00:46:20,634
Why are you looking for Aoi and Numano?

685
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:26,127
Numano's set fire 5 cases in this 5 years

686
00:46:27,619 --> 00:46:29,447
This is clearly an insurance fraud.

687
00:46:29,627 --> 00:46:30,720
But there is no evidence

688
00:46:30,806 --> 00:46:31,986
I need the evidence

689
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:33,939
You should ask police

690
00:46:34,361 --> 00:46:35,572
But there is no evidence

691
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:37,103
So you should give up

692
00:46:38,322 --> 00:46:39,697
I won't give up

693
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:45,189
My colleague was killed by Aoi during an internal
investigation.

694
00:46:49,025 --> 00:46:50,416
So please

695
00:46:51,431 --> 00:46:52,236
Find him

696
00:46:53,541 --> 00:46:55,775
Will you get paid more per month if the case is
solved?

697
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:57,236
Little

698
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:01,736
That's ridiculous that your salary will be raise and I will be arrested

699
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:06,759
I'm just asking you if you could bring Aoi

700
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:10,088
Then I can arrest him for some reason

701
00:47:10,113 --> 00:47:11,181
Then you will investigate

702
00:47:11,206 --> 00:47:11,814
Yes

703
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:13,572
You'll arrest me too

704
00:47:13,884 --> 00:47:16,455
I need you to testify to the facts in court.

705
00:47:16,689 --> 00:47:17,509
No way

706
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,626
Hey, pay your bill

707
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:21,517
I won't treat you

708
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:23,517
You are persistent

709
00:47:23,931 --> 00:47:25,337
I'll arrest you

710
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:26,775
You are bullshit

711
00:47:27,454 --> 00:47:28,056
Bye

712
00:47:28,298 --> 00:47:29,017
Hey

713
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:32,907
So Please

714
00:47:33,111 --> 00:47:38,103
If you do, I will tell you where that woman works

715
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:42,751
She is so beautiful

716
00:47:46,423 --> 00:47:50,126
Ok.  I will do what you want

717
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:20,501
Is Fukunishi here?

718
00:48:20,540 --> 00:48:23,626
Is Fukunishi here?

719
00:48:24,197 --> 00:48:27,907
Midoris-san, please go to No.5 table

720
00:48:28,431 --> 00:48:31,056
Midoris-san, please go to No.5 table

721
00:48:33,564 --> 00:48:36,814
I finally found you

722
00:48:37,907 --> 00:48:39,064
I could hear your voice

723
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:43,439
Are you free tonight?

724
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:51,040
Who are you?

725
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,048
He is the man who caused the murder in Shikoku

726
00:48:53,853 --> 00:48:56,025
Oh you are alive

727
00:48:56,251 --> 00:48:57,079
What's wrong?

728
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:58,322
It's none of your business

729
00:48:59,665 --> 00:49:01,939
I just want to talk with her

730
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:05,447
Don't touch her

731
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:06,697
Wait

732
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:10,775
What's the hell are you doing?

733
00:49:11,345 --> 00:49:14,243
I will never let go of the woman I once liked

734
00:49:14,806 --> 00:49:15,876
I will chase her

735
00:49:15,915 --> 00:49:17,126
Don't say bullshit

736
00:49:17,376 --> 00:49:18,517
You are mother fucker

737
00:49:52,814 --> 00:49:53,462
Hey

738
00:49:55,197 --> 00:49:56,407
What the hell

739
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:00,478
You are bullshit

740
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:06,306
I pretend to sleep in order to get in here

741
00:50:08,361 --> 00:50:10,056
Don't say bullshit

742
00:50:11,681 --> 00:50:13,798
What do you want?

743
00:50:14,947 --> 00:50:16,704
Can I see that girl?

744
00:50:17,853 --> 00:50:18,548
How much you pay?

745
00:50:18,657 --> 00:50:20,095
I have no money

746
00:50:20,946 --> 00:50:24,118
You guys broke my mother's grave, right?

747
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,462
What the hell are you talking?

748
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:30,133
What?
You won't give me that girl?

749
00:50:30,564 --> 00:50:31,322
What?

750
00:50:32,423 --> 00:50:33,712
Don't get angry

751
00:50:34,548 --> 00:50:38,056
We can't give the Asako to you in the end

752
00:50:38,626 --> 00:50:42,095
Our client wants her

753
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:43,447
Is that right?

754
00:50:44,603 --> 00:50:47,712
She is his girl now

755
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:51,447
We give the Asako to our client

756
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:52,712
Boss

757
00:50:53,118 --> 00:50:53,689
What?

758
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,103
I want to tell you something

759
00:50:56,915 --> 00:50:59,845
Please don't give my lover to the customer

760
00:51:00,728 --> 00:51:01,501
Listen

761
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,845
When did you become great?

762
00:51:05,157 --> 00:51:07,532
Please boss

763
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:10,603
Please don't give my lover to the customer

764
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:17,892
Hey

765
00:51:18,673 --> 00:51:20,657
Stop splitting up the group.

766
00:51:20,697 --> 00:51:21,907
It's none of your business

767
00:51:23,439 --> 00:51:27,587
I like to stop the fighting

768
00:51:29,618 --> 00:51:32,923
Can you give me the girl if you don't want to give her to the customer

769
00:51:33,275 --> 00:51:35,111
No way

770
00:51:35,462 --> 00:51:38,540
But bear in mind

771
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:43,087
It's better if you give me the girl

772
00:51:43,626 --> 00:51:47,962
It's a shame to play women in the same group

773
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:53,048
Leave it to me.
You can give up your mind and she'd be happy

774
00:51:54,212 --> 00:51:55,072
Shut up

775
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:58,055
I'm waiting for your reply

776
00:51:58,618 --> 00:52:02,329
I can't forgive you guys

777
00:52:03,204 --> 00:52:06,087
You guys broke my mother's grave

778
00:52:06,892 --> 00:52:10,032
I will fight back with you guys
Please the girl in 10 days if you don't want

779
00:52:12,103 --> 00:52:16,579
Please me 42 million if you can't that

780
00:52:17,392 --> 00:52:18,423
42 million?

781
00:52:18,634 --> 00:52:20,181
The insurance money

782
00:52:21,173 --> 00:52:21,665
What do you think?

783
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:24,290
Don't say bullshit

784
00:52:24,572 --> 00:52:26,048
Aoi doesn't do it

785
00:52:29,345 --> 00:52:31,673
I'm not talking about Aoi

786
00:52:42,407 --> 00:52:43,095
See you

787
00:52:54,423 --> 00:52:55,173
She's nice

788
00:52:57,751 --> 00:53:00,344
Hey, you didn't pay

789
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,329
Eh?

790
00:53:01,759 --> 00:53:02,611
Pay the money

791
00:53:02,829 --> 00:53:04,798
What I have to pay?

792
00:53:04,823 --> 00:53:07,212
Don't pretend you don't know

793
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:08,165
Pay the money

794
00:53:08,353 --> 00:53:10,220
Oh clean my cloth

795
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,736
Pay the money

796
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:16,181
You are insist.
If I tell the police you will be arrested

797
00:53:16,314 --> 00:53:18,095
I don't worry about that

798
00:53:18,134 --> 00:53:21,407
Then I will go to the police alone

799
00:53:23,439 --> 00:53:24,384
You bite me

800
00:53:24,728 --> 00:53:27,173
You look like a rabies

801
00:53:27,548 --> 00:53:29,290
Pay the money

802
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:32,095
What's wrong?

803
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,525
Oh ryoko

804
00:53:34,665 --> 00:53:36,845
Oh, Manege

805
00:53:36,870 --> 00:53:37,852
What are you doing here?

806
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:42,103
He played for free last night.
Pay the money

807
00:53:42,986 --> 00:53:44,634
You become a Whore?

808
00:53:44,659 --> 00:53:47,180
Yes, Because I just need my body

809
00:53:47,205 --> 00:53:48,134
Don't push yourself too hard

810
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:48,563
Pay the money

811
00:53:48,697 --> 00:53:52,087
Hey you,
Pay the money

812
00:53:52,118 --> 00:53:53,728
I have no money

813
00:53:53,986 --> 00:53:55,180
What?

814
00:53:55,212 --> 00:53:56,173
It hurts

815
00:53:56,198 --> 00:53:57,228
Stop it

816
00:53:57,253 --> 00:53:58,697
Look at me

817
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:00,876
I found 200 yen

818
00:54:00,901 --> 00:54:02,204
This is not enough

819
00:54:02,876 --> 00:54:04,602
I have no money

820
00:54:04,627 --> 00:54:06,001
I have no money anymore

821
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:09,173
It's no use looking for it anymore

822
00:54:09,198 --> 00:54:10,298
What can we do?

823
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:12,025
It seems he has no money

824
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:16,290
You are the lover of this woman?

825
00:54:16,315 --> 00:54:17,861
Don't say bullshit

826
00:54:17,947 --> 00:54:19,587
I'm just friend

827
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:21,548
I see

828
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,204
Get out of here

829
00:54:23,736 --> 00:54:24,665
Forgive him

830
00:54:24,712 --> 00:54:26,266
Ok I get it

831
00:54:26,634 --> 00:54:27,954
Get out of here

832
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:30,314
Ok, sorry to make you trouble

833
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,759
You are nasty woman

834
00:54:32,829 --> 00:54:33,736
What?

835
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:35,259
I didn't do anything

836
00:54:35,478 --> 00:54:36,626
Why do you laugh?

837
00:54:41,618 --> 00:54:44,431
200 yen is ok,
I didn't lose myself

838
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:46,181
Thank you

839
00:54:46,681 --> 00:54:50,236
I work there, 2F.
Do you want to come to play?

840
00:54:51,282 --> 00:54:52,986
I don't feel like playing

841
00:54:53,189 --> 00:54:54,353
You don't like me?

842
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:57,236
No no, I don't feel well.
My stomach is bad

843
00:54:57,384 --> 00:54:58,845
So I don't work today

844
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:02,298
I will see you when I get better

845
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:07,064
I won't work with you

846
00:55:07,197 --> 00:55:07,970
Did you find the girl?

847
00:55:08,032 --> 00:55:12,017
Yes the girl was there but It was difficult to take out.
and Aoi was not there

848
00:55:12,486 --> 00:55:13,454
I won't work with you

849
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:16,407
Hey, you promised

850
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,712
But you didn't tell me where she lives

851
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:21,438
What did you say

852
00:55:21,463 --> 00:55:22,439
Stop it

853
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:50,642
I'm familiar with here

854
00:55:53,439 --> 00:55:54,447
Stop it

855
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:56,439
Ok I will find him

856
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:58,009
Don't make a lie

857
00:55:58,501 --> 00:55:59,470
You know?

858
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:01,180
Anyway come with me

859
00:56:04,142 --> 00:56:04,680
Fuck you

860
00:56:04,705 --> 00:56:05,853
Don't resent me

861
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:24,353
He will go home

862
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:28,251
Thank you

863
00:56:28,492 --> 00:56:31,422
Oh Mama!

864
00:56:33,072 --> 00:56:34,829
I'll come back tomorrow

865
00:56:37,806 --> 00:56:39,212
Thank you

866
00:56:39,970 --> 00:56:41,689
See you tomorrow

867
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:43,439
Thank you, go home now

868
00:56:45,353 --> 00:56:46,306
See you

869
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:02,798
I'm tired

870
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:08,063
I'm going out

871
00:57:09,243 --> 00:57:10,361
Where are you going?

872
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,587
I'm going to go get some air.

873
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:15,329
Do you have an affair?

874
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:21,251
You will take care of me for a month so I can't betray you.

875
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,345
Can I believe?

876
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:24,822
Trust me

877
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,845
OK OK

878
00:57:29,072 --> 00:57:31,165
What? She quit job?

879
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:34,329
tell me where she has gone?

880
00:57:34,595 --> 00:57:35,298
I don't know

881
00:57:35,712 --> 00:57:37,056
You don't know?

882
00:57:37,275 --> 00:57:39,126
Oh you are here

883
00:57:40,118 --> 00:57:42,782
Sorry for the last time.
I didn't mean that

884
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:44,415
You were so mean

885
00:57:44,603 --> 00:57:45,595
Don't get upset

886
00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:47,907
Where is the girl?

887
00:57:48,853 --> 00:57:51,767
I know but I can't tell

888
00:57:52,665 --> 00:57:54,673
Because you broke our promise

889
00:57:54,931 --> 00:57:55,790
I see

890
00:57:57,134 --> 00:57:59,579
She's gone too far.

891
00:58:00,845 --> 00:58:03,119
Did she die?

892
00:58:03,697 --> 00:58:06,697
Are you stupid?
She's alive

893
00:58:07,095 --> 00:58:10,962
If she's alive, I'll find her alone.

894
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:16,337
You've given up fighting with Aoi?

895
00:58:17,806 --> 00:58:22,298
Aoi is in Daiko.
You are the only who can fight with him

896
00:58:23,384 --> 00:58:26,790
I don't care about him.
I just need her

897
00:58:28,181 --> 00:58:30,689
Daiko hide her

898
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:34,173
You like her so much?

899
00:58:34,494 --> 00:58:38,908
I like what I like, and I don't like what I don't like.

900
00:58:39,837 --> 00:58:41,978
I'll do whatever I want

901
00:58:43,306 --> 00:58:44,087
See you

902
00:58:50,298 --> 00:58:53,447
As long as she is here, he can't leave from Kobe

903
00:59:10,158 --> 00:59:11,283
Don't come closer

904
00:59:11,994 --> 00:59:13,923
Kill her when you come

905
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:22,158
Oh you are here

906
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:22,869
Don't come closer

907
00:59:23,197 --> 00:59:25,548
Let's talk

908
00:59:25,573 --> 00:59:26,181
Don't come closer

909
00:59:28,954 --> 00:59:30,400
Let's talk

910
00:59:33,165 --> 00:59:34,025
Wait!

911
00:59:39,408 --> 00:59:40,369
Wait!

912
00:59:47,009 --> 00:59:47,736
Kou-Chan

913
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:48,978
Kou-Chan

914
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,447
Kou-Chan

915
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:52,814
Kou-Chan

916
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:55,470
Kou-Chan

917
01:00:13,173 --> 01:00:14,970
You can't see your boss either way

918
01:00:33,267 --> 01:00:33,861
What is a fatal injury

919
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:34,501
This

920
01:00:36,431 --> 01:00:37,298
Isn't he drowning?

921
01:00:37,564 --> 01:00:39,494
He drinks a lot of water but is not drowning

922
01:00:54,165 --> 01:00:55,728
Can you announce that he's dead in water?

923
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:57,478
Why?

924
01:00:59,423 --> 01:01:02,126
I don't want to be known to Daiko

925
01:01:02,736 --> 01:01:06,494
Please write the facts on the documents and announce to the media that you are dead.

926
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:12,244
I think this case is deep

927
01:01:12,954 --> 01:01:13,829
So please

928
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:02,962
What did you do?

929
01:02:03,384 --> 01:02:05,626
There is a police outside

930
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:09,384
Why the police know our plan?

931
01:02:10,603 --> 01:02:12,165
Calm down

932
01:02:12,837 --> 01:02:16,033
I don't think Numano get arrested now

933
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:25,235
It seems Koichi has been dead

934
01:02:25,931 --> 01:02:28,033
He seems to have died in water

935
01:02:28,158 --> 01:02:29,275
He seems to have died in water?

936
01:02:32,322 --> 01:02:37,439
If he died on the job, his buddies will bring the incense.

937
01:02:37,665 --> 01:02:39,736
We can have a good funeral for him

938
01:02:40,181 --> 01:02:42,658
But it would be embarrassing if he died after drinking water

939
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:44,689
Ask police to take care of him

940
01:02:44,931 --> 01:02:49,392
Bring his bones later

941
01:02:54,392 --> 01:02:57,532
Koichi's girlfriend seems to have gone somewhere with that man.

942
01:02:57,853 --> 01:03:02,923
But he's easy to find.
We've already set up a lookout.

943
01:03:04,165 --> 01:03:05,228
Don't worry,Aoi

944
01:03:17,704 --> 01:03:22,017
If you want to be killed by your lover

945
01:03:24,986 --> 01:03:26,056
Use this

946
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,314
I killed your lover

947
01:03:31,384 --> 01:03:32,751
so use this

948
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:37,665
You told me you'd rather be killed by that lover.

949
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:40,736
I also want to be killed by a woman I like

950
01:03:42,681 --> 01:03:43,533
Kill me

951
01:03:46,931 --> 01:03:47,720
Kill me

952
01:03:49,962 --> 01:03:53,744
There's nothing in my head that makes me sound
light.

953
01:03:57,869 --> 01:04:01,462
It's more stable if you hold it with both hands.

954
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,048
Shoot me

955
01:04:06,345 --> 01:04:10,095
It's more stable if you hold it with both hands.

956
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:22,119
Why you don't shoot me?

957
01:04:25,134 --> 01:04:27,908
Well..I have no money

958
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:30,423
I'll be homeless after I pay the hotel fee

959
01:04:32,845 --> 01:04:36,025
You'll be fine if you kill me

960
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:40,134
I have money

961
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:52,376
I got rid of my household goods when I ran away.

962
01:04:53,697 --> 01:04:55,517
I don't need this money

963
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,009
I should leave?

964
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:02,665
No?

965
01:05:03,736 --> 01:05:08,345
Why?
You hate me,right?

966
01:05:15,744 --> 01:05:17,853
I'm not comfortable to be here

967
01:05:19,126 --> 01:05:22,978
I'm leaving.
You should use that money, and leave here

968
01:05:24,650 --> 01:05:26,439
Be careful of Daiko group

969
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,775
We should leave here

970
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:36,829
Then I'm going

971
01:05:37,626 --> 01:05:38,533
Wait

972
01:05:40,962 --> 01:05:42,001
What's wrong?

973
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:47,728
Can you book a ticket for Tokyo with this money?

974
01:05:50,876 --> 01:05:51,923
Are you going to Tokyo?

975
01:05:53,384 --> 01:05:57,494
Yes, I have friends there

976
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:05,509
Ok I will go to book

977
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:14,962
Wait for me

978
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:24,861
Where have you been?

979
01:06:25,306 --> 01:06:26,915
I'm originally homeless

980
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,564
I'm originally homeless, so what?

981
01:06:30,072 --> 01:06:33,345
You can come back to me whenever you want

982
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:36,181
The new bartender is too young.

983
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:39,579
I'm living with a woman I like.

984
01:06:40,314 --> 01:06:42,095
Do you seduce me?

985
01:06:43,619 --> 01:06:46,665
I get it, I won't treat this

986
01:06:47,376 --> 01:06:48,853
You are so mean

987
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:52,829
I want to drink

988
01:06:52,854 --> 01:06:53,869
Do you have money?

989
01:06:54,408 --> 01:06:55,611
I have no money

990
01:06:56,369 --> 01:06:57,033
How much?

991
01:06:57,259 --> 01:07:01,204
you only have 5000 yen?
You drunk more than 10000yen

992
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:02,525
What?

993
01:07:02,704 --> 01:07:03,704
Ken

994
01:07:04,837 --> 01:07:07,376
This man eats and drinks without paying.

995
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:09,181
I want to drink

996
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,376
Fuck you

997
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,859
You made me angry

998
01:07:31,025 --> 01:07:32,025
Fuck you

999
01:07:40,587 --> 01:07:42,619
The ticket for Tokyo were sold out

1000
01:07:43,712 --> 01:07:44,712
You are lying

1001
01:07:45,564 --> 01:07:46,579
You think so?

1002
01:07:47,126 --> 01:07:47,650
Yes

1003
01:07:49,626 --> 01:07:51,884
This is the first lie I've ever told in my life.

1004
01:07:52,337 --> 01:07:53,267
Why?

1005
01:07:54,275 --> 01:07:57,173
Don't ask me why!

1006
01:07:58,892 --> 01:08:04,220
Why do you like those gangsters?

1007
01:08:04,939 --> 01:08:05,697
Shit!

1008
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,603
They are all rubbish

1009
01:08:11,970 --> 01:08:13,001
You are rubbish too

1010
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:15,111
Yes I am

1011
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:21,665
The yakuza are nothing but scum.

1012
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:24,392
They are no use

1013
01:08:25,126 --> 01:08:27,345
I'm sorry for that

1014
01:08:28,384 --> 01:08:30,244
You're going to live in denial about who you
are.

1015
01:08:32,439 --> 01:08:34,579
You think you're boring.

1016
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:38,548
I don't think so

1017
01:08:39,587 --> 01:08:44,095
There are good yakuza and there are bad yakuza.

1018
01:08:45,267 --> 01:08:46,900
I'm good yakuza

1019
01:08:47,267 --> 01:08:50,962
I'm a cool gangster living on my own.

1020
01:08:52,322 --> 01:08:58,001
Your last lover was a pathetic man.

1021
01:09:02,962 --> 01:09:06,415
You were killed if I was not there at that time

1022
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:14,017
Anyone who thinks it's a good idea to be killed by yakuza is an idiot.

1023
01:09:14,728 --> 01:09:18,478
He protected me so

1024
01:09:18,751 --> 01:09:21,665
How much you loved him?

1025
01:09:22,665 --> 01:09:27,688
It's not uncommon for a gangster's woman to be taken by a client.

1026
01:09:28,564 --> 01:09:30,908
He was not Yakuza

1027
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:32,298
He was not?

1028
01:09:33,611 --> 01:09:37,970
Don't say bullshit.
He was really Yakuza

1029
01:09:38,494 --> 01:09:39,454
He has a pistol

1030
01:09:41,861 --> 01:09:43,329
Needless to say

1031
01:09:45,931 --> 01:09:51,704
Ok, You loved him so much,
I have no choice to leave here

1032
01:09:52,658 --> 01:09:56,392
I don't want to hear about your ex lover

1033
01:09:57,579 --> 01:10:01,783
They broke my mother's grave. I just hate them.

1034
01:10:02,915 --> 01:10:03,962
That's it

1035
01:10:04,619 --> 01:10:08,048
Wait, I hate them too

1036
01:10:09,884 --> 01:10:11,447
I was not his girlfriend

1037
01:10:13,314 --> 01:10:16,595
What do you mean?

1038
01:10:17,829 --> 01:10:21,329
What are you saying about it?

1039
01:10:24,283 --> 01:10:25,814
Say you loved him!

1040
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,869
He's my younger brother

1041
01:10:42,502 --> 01:10:43,197
What?

1042
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:46,416
Your younger brother?

1043
01:10:47,252 --> 01:10:51,072
You're not making any sense.

1044
01:10:52,017 --> 01:10:54,127
Don't try to rely on me.

1045
01:10:54,205 --> 01:10:54,947
It's true

1046
01:10:55,971 --> 01:11:01,705
We both lived in my hometown.

1047
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:05,142
We didn't have any relatives.

1048
01:11:06,017 --> 01:11:08,596
It was the land I came back to after the war.

1049
01:11:09,314 --> 01:11:11,142
You came back to after the war.

1050
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:20,650
He had worked in Kobe after graduating from junior high school. He wrote to me every month.

1051
01:11:21,564 --> 01:11:27,791
But He stopped writing to me. He couldn't escape from Daiko when I visited to Kobe

1052
01:11:29,844 --> 01:11:33,828
I didn't know she was your younger brother

1053
01:11:35,367 --> 01:11:42,765
He told me we should pretend to lover. Otherwise Daiko attack me

1054
01:11:45,047 --> 01:11:47,453
This is what he loves me

1055
01:11:49,633 --> 01:11:55,461
He introduced me a quiet bar for working

1056
01:11:57,985 --> 01:12:02,531
We were waiting for a chance to escape, but we couldn't.

1057
01:12:03,946 --> 01:12:09,860
He planed to kill me and kill himself

1058
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:28,688
He protected me.
That's what he loves me

1059
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:33,758
I should have told me at bar

1060
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:39,578
I couldn't tell you. I was worried The Guy who is Wakamatsu took me

1061
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,524
I was idiot

1062
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:47,641
I was idiot

1063
01:12:49,289 --> 01:12:51,914
Please hit me

1064
01:12:54,024 --> 01:12:55,227
Please hit me

1065
01:13:04,914 --> 01:13:06,000
Never mind

1066
01:13:11,641 --> 01:13:14,758
I'll protect you

1067
01:13:16,211 --> 01:13:18,828
You might annoy

1068
01:13:20,188 --> 01:13:21,367
But I'll protect you

1069
01:13:23,938 --> 01:13:24,914
I'll protect you

1070
01:13:31,094 --> 01:13:32,016
Have a seat

1071
01:13:35,141 --> 01:13:37,360
I'll treat you a meal today

1072
01:13:38,555 --> 01:13:42,922
Please ask the police to hand over the remains of Koichi Karasawa to me.

1073
01:13:44,406 --> 01:13:48,602
She can't go out for some reason

1074
01:13:49,821 --> 01:13:52,789
Daiko came to pick up the remains of Koichi
Karasawa

1075
01:13:53,203 --> 01:13:54,008
Really?

1076
01:13:56,305 --> 01:14:00,430
They'll use the remains to collect incense.

1077
01:14:01,547 --> 01:14:03,688
Tell them why, and they'll give you the money.

1078
01:14:05,453 --> 01:14:06,102
OK

1079
01:14:09,852 --> 01:14:11,641
Are you going to get it?

1080
01:14:12,805 --> 01:14:13,555
I will get it

1081
01:14:14,024 --> 01:14:15,289
Don't do that

1082
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:18,703
It's none of your business

1083
01:14:19,344 --> 01:14:21,047
Where did you hide her?

1084
01:14:22,797 --> 01:14:24,235
It's none of your business

1085
01:14:25,164 --> 01:14:26,156
You'll be in trouble

1086
01:14:26,821 --> 01:14:28,735
I don't care about it

1087
01:14:30,274 --> 01:14:34,328
You are in Daiko now. and found Aoi

1088
01:14:35,563 --> 01:14:38,078
You don't want to fight with Aoi anymore

1089
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:44,242
I really don't want to fight with Aoi

1090
01:14:59,508 --> 01:15:00,922
Why I can't get his bone?

1091
01:15:01,617 --> 01:15:04,352
Because It's ours

1092
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,086
Humanity is important in this world.

1093
01:15:08,766 --> 01:15:10,274
We are not in normal world

1094
01:15:11,305 --> 01:15:15,774
Listen, We'll give you his bone if you accept our
deal

1095
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:16,836
Deal?

1096
01:15:17,461 --> 01:15:20,516
I know you hided his girl anywhere

1097
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,719
We want her

1098
01:15:23,446 --> 01:15:24,821
We'll give you his borne in return

1099
01:15:25,774 --> 01:15:26,664
You idiot

1100
01:15:27,164 --> 01:15:27,914
What?

1101
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:31,890
I'll give you her in return

1102
01:15:32,312 --> 01:15:33,898
So We can't give you

1103
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:35,773
What are you going to do with her?

1104
01:15:36,289 --> 01:15:38,273
Do you guys give her to a guest named Akamatsu?

1105
01:15:38,359 --> 01:15:39,257
That's right

1106
01:15:39,555 --> 01:15:41,375
He requested the woman

1107
01:15:41,844 --> 01:15:44,078
He requested? He's not king

1108
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:45,703
I can't give you

1109
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:53,906
If you don't give it, let's play one-on-one

1110
01:15:54,219 --> 01:15:57,789
Ok, that's interesting

1111
01:15:58,391 --> 01:16:01,180
Ok you fight with Akamatsu

1112
01:16:03,086 --> 01:16:03,828
Tell me

1113
01:16:06,289 --> 01:16:08,984
Sure  I can

1114
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:10,969
Shooting?

1115
01:16:15,195 --> 01:16:15,953
When?

1116
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:18,305
Where?

1117
01:16:21,906 --> 01:16:23,391
You can decide it

1118
01:16:58,539 --> 01:17:03,375
Boss, Kamoi knows everything, so he acted like that

1119
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,305
I think so

1120
01:17:08,164 --> 01:17:10,406
He is not so clever

1121
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:15,984
Anyway He knows Aoi is here

1122
01:17:16,672 --> 01:17:22,430
Boss,Before it's too late, Let's contact Numano from our end.

1123
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:34,477
I won't run away

1124
01:17:35,383 --> 01:17:39,906
I won't run away.
I was just shopping around

1125
01:17:40,867 --> 01:17:41,734
Damn it

1126
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:45,836
Wanna fight?

1127
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:50,523
Fuck you

1128
01:17:56,312 --> 01:17:57,516
Watch out

1129
01:17:59,820 --> 01:18:01,703
You are an employee of a furniture store, right?

1130
01:18:05,297 --> 01:18:09,758
You were in Numano office.
I was deceived

1131
01:18:11,133 --> 01:18:13,477
He's in Daiko now

1132
01:18:13,992 --> 01:18:17,883
He crushed my company

1133
01:18:17,908 --> 01:18:19,273
It's none of my business

1134
01:18:19,298 --> 01:18:21,453
Please call him

1135
01:18:21,478 --> 01:18:23,391
Please call him

1136
01:18:24,141 --> 01:18:26,367
Akamatsu is Aoi

1137
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:33,578
Akamatsu is Aoi?

1138
01:18:36,570 --> 01:18:41,094
I'll see Numano again.

1139
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:10,648
Hey

1140
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,680
Aoi kill him

1141
01:19:18,055 --> 01:19:18,734
Aoi

1142
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:20,156
Why you are here?

1143
01:19:21,586 --> 01:19:22,266
I'll leave

1144
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,508
Who killed Koichi?

1145
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,109
I have no idea

1146
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:43,602
Do you know this?

1147
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:46,281
What's this?

1148
01:19:46,391 --> 01:19:47,242
Don't pretend you don't know

1149
01:19:47,437 --> 01:19:48,570
This is that weapon

1150
01:19:48,836 --> 01:19:49,227
Eh?

1151
01:19:55,062 --> 01:19:56,687
He was killed by this

1152
01:20:00,523 --> 01:20:02,828
I see

1153
01:20:05,641 --> 01:20:08,922
Daiko found where you live

1154
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:25,156
Anyone come?

1155
01:20:25,359 --> 01:20:25,734
Who?

1156
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:26,508
Daiko

1157
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:28,750
Only this cat came

1158
01:20:31,133 --> 01:20:32,133
What are you doing?

1159
01:20:33,641 --> 01:20:35,461
I didn't kill Koichi

1160
01:20:35,914 --> 01:20:37,922
He was killed by a knife

1161
01:20:38,484 --> 01:20:44,789
You are mine.
I’m never gonna let you go

1162
01:20:55,047 --> 01:20:59,047
It's true.
There are witnesses in the police

1163
01:21:08,219 --> 01:21:11,984
I have never loved women

1164
01:21:13,992 --> 01:21:15,133
I don't know what I want to do in these situations.

1165
01:21:17,125 --> 01:21:19,875
Tell me what should I do in this situation?

1166
01:21:22,359 --> 01:21:23,461
You hate me?

1167
01:21:25,484 --> 01:21:26,187
No?

1168
01:21:30,297 --> 01:21:32,086
Run away

1169
01:21:32,111 --> 01:21:35,203
I can't.
You need his bone,right?

1170
01:21:35,258 --> 01:21:36,757
Don't worry

1171
01:21:36,805 --> 01:21:37,758
I don't think so

1172
01:21:38,945 --> 01:21:41,945
They broke my mother's grave

1173
01:21:42,547 --> 01:21:44,102
We should get the bone

1174
01:21:45,156 --> 01:21:48,930
I'm a real Yakuza

1175
01:21:50,156 --> 01:21:52,305
I value humanity.

1176
01:21:57,391 --> 01:22:00,977
I have never escaped

1177
01:22:03,383 --> 01:22:05,133
Ok I get it

1178
01:22:05,992 --> 01:22:08,258
You make me gamble

1179
01:22:09,344 --> 01:22:11,375
Daiko gets me if you lose

1180
01:22:11,695 --> 01:22:13,523
That's what you think

1181
01:22:13,548 --> 01:22:14,336
No way

1182
01:22:15,227 --> 01:22:16,070
I'll win

1183
01:22:18,531 --> 01:22:23,891
I think Koichi would be happy if we lived a life of poverty and happiness here.

1184
01:22:25,109 --> 01:22:28,289
We can start new life from here,Kobe

1185
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:30,148
Daybreak soon

1186
01:22:32,227 --> 01:22:35,836
We can start new life

1187
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:37,453
Yes,that's right

1188
01:22:38,031 --> 01:22:39,789
Don't you think so?

1189
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,914
Good morning

1190
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:08,008
Akamatsu says

1191
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:09,047
He's Aoi

1192
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:11,570
You've known?

1193
01:23:12,008 --> 01:23:13,398
The promised day is tomorrow, right?

1194
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,734
It seems that he's not feeling well tomorrow

1195
01:23:16,211 --> 01:23:18,078
I'm ready anytime

1196
01:23:25,062 --> 01:23:25,937
I'll take a walk

1197
01:23:26,062 --> 01:23:26,875
Don't go

1198
01:23:28,266 --> 01:23:31,461
You can go to Tokyo or wherever you want to go

1199
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:34,586
I will find you later

1200
01:23:35,117 --> 01:23:35,977
Don't go

1201
01:23:37,906 --> 01:23:39,914
It's none of your business

1202
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:41,102
Let's go

1203
01:23:42,547 --> 01:23:43,758
We go together

1204
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,539
I'll take care of her

1205
01:23:45,564 --> 01:23:46,125
What?

1206
01:23:46,344 --> 01:23:47,844
She's Aoi's girl

1207
01:23:49,617 --> 01:23:50,906
She's mine

1208
01:23:55,047 --> 01:23:57,055
Can you go with me?

1209
01:25:01,336 --> 01:25:02,305
Get out

1210
01:25:03,352 --> 01:25:03,961
Get out

1211
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:09,320
Fuck you

1212
01:27:16,664 --> 01:27:17,172
Damn it

1213
01:27:41,820 --> 01:27:44,664
Kamoi, this is the Yakuza

1214
01:29:11,555 --> 01:29:12,547
They are coming

1215
01:29:18,891 --> 01:29:19,649
Run away

1216
01:29:21,508 --> 01:29:22,125
No

1217
01:29:23,641 --> 01:29:25,508
Let's raise his monthly salary

1218
01:29:53,531 --> 01:29:56,703
Will you provide accommodation for a homeless?

1219
01:29:59,219 --> 01:29:59,820
Yes

1220
01:30:02,711 --> 01:30:07,625
Please take care of her food and where she lives.

1221
01:30:09,258 --> 01:30:12,867
I will testify in court instead

1222
01:30:18,860 --> 01:30:20,961
I wish I could go to jail with her

1223
01:30:37,328 --> 01:30:39,617
Your salary is too low to take care of her

1224
01:30:41,805 --> 01:30:45,328
Please take care of the formalities so that I can take her to jail, to her prison.

1225
01:31:01,211 --> 01:31:03,180
Don't go

1226
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:21,734
THE END

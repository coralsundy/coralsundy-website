2
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,982
I was asking you if you did or not!

3
00:01:59,638 --> 00:02:04,544
Soldiers risk their lives fighting for their country.

4
00:02:07,567 --> 00:02:08,567
You know?

5
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:25,836
You committed an offense without permission.

6
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:58,944
<i>Kubi (1968)</i>

7
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:36,608
You really like it.

8
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:40,600
Paper relies on donations from readers.

9
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:45,647
If I get the paper without permission,the police will arrest me.

10
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,350
It could be.

11
00:04:50,452 --> 00:04:54,803
The criticism of the Cabinet that you wrote last year was pretty good.

12
00:04:55,358 --> 00:04:57,022
I had to write it.

13
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:03,068
People are too quiet these days.

14
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:09,701
You have a good reputation with the judge.

15
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:12,169
They don't like soldiers, so they like you.

16
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:22,037
You have a very high reputation as a lawyer, so I think it's best not to push yourself too hard.

17
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:24,029
Don't worry.

18
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:25,529
Are you sure?

19
00:05:28,107 --> 00:05:36,576
Don't worry.
I'm 48 years old and have been through a lot of hardships.

20
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,837
Mr.Masaki.
There's a phone call for you.

21
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,228
Yes that's right.

22
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:50,150
He is a foreman at a coal mine in Ibaraki Prefecture....

23
00:05:51,596 --> 00:05:53,424
He's a very fit man.

24
00:05:54,174 --> 00:06:02,346
He died of a cerebral hemorrhage three days after being detained by the police.

25
00:06:03,484 --> 00:06:05,039
I doubt it...

26
00:06:06,383 --> 00:06:07,469
He was killed?

27
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:12,141
There is such a suspicion.

28
00:06:12,586 --> 00:06:19,039
Takita-san and Kishimoto-san, who are involved in the project, are asking about me.

29
00:06:22,684 --> 00:06:27,598
Mrs. Takita lives in Tokyo and is close to me.

30
00:06:31,293 --> 00:06:36,543
I know you are busy, but could you meet with them once?

31
00:06:40,465 --> 00:06:41,207
I get it.

32
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:45,019
Instead of taking them to the office, we take them to the bar hall.

33
00:06:53,534 --> 00:07:00,363
This is Aokura Village, Nalahara District, Ibaraki Prefecture, where Takita Coal Mine, which is run by my dog, is located.

34
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:22,301
This is a very small coal mine.

35
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:30,469
We used to have about 80 employees, but now we have very few employees.

36
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:36,437
We currently have 34 employees including us.

37
00:07:37,461 --> 00:07:40,180
Have you been running this place for a long time?

38
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:41,133
No.

39
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:57,523
My late husband owned a mountain in Sendai.
But it was far away, so we sold it and bought this mountain.

40
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,828
This is the only coal mine in this village?

41
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:09,390
There is another mountain called Katayama Coal Mine.

42
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:14,578


43
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,125
I'd like to hear about the man who was killed.

44
00:08:19,094 --> 00:08:21,094
He is called our worker,Sakiyama.

45
00:08:22,054 --> 00:08:22,937
Sakiyama?

46
00:08:27,588 --> 00:08:31,581
He was a mine guide.

47
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:52,359
He's the one who investigated and decided where the mineral deposits would be..

48
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:59,114
He was an important figure in the management of the mine.

49
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:03,044
We needed him.

50
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,169
Is he from this village?

51
00:09:05,263 --> 00:09:11,153
He was from Fukushima Prefecture and worked for Tokiwa Coal.

52
00:09:14,063 --> 00:09:20,899
He returned to Fukushima on January 15th to attend a relative's wedding.

53
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:25,024
Today is 24th..

54
00:09:25,782 --> 00:09:29,282
He came back on January 20th, 4 days ago from today.

55
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:16,612
Are you Noboru Umura from Sakiyama?

56
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:18,378
Yes I am.

57
00:10:19,456 --> 00:10:23,792
I have something to ask you, so please come to the police station.

58
00:10:24,461 --> 00:10:26,844
Why you ask me?

59
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:32,649
Anyway come with me.

60
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:37,617
He is Yasui, police here.

61
00:10:40,297 --> 00:10:42,211
Is he from the police station?

62
00:10:44,874 --> 00:10:47,725
He was arrested for gambling on Hanafuda cards.

63
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,668
It was the evening of January 20th.

64
00:11:14,066 --> 00:11:19,941
Two days later, Officer YASUI came to the mine.

65
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:30,070
Have a seat.

66
00:11:31,423 --> 00:11:33,633
I would like to tell you about Okumura in police custody on the 20th.

67
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,657
I'm sorry for causing you trouble.

68
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:41,946
He suddenly died of a cerebral hemorrhage this morning.

69
00:11:43,876 --> 00:11:46,532
We want you to come and retrieve his body.

70
00:11:50,298 --> 00:11:51,720
His cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage?

71
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:52,978
Yes.

72
00:12:00,533 --> 00:12:03,960
Anyway we went out to the police station in Osaki.

73
00:12:08,236 --> 00:12:09,863
I'm upset just remembering it.

74
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:13,651
It was just Hanafuda gambling.

75
00:12:14,928 --> 00:12:19,101
He was in jail for 3 days and he was kicked and hit.

76
00:12:21,851 --> 00:12:23,838
Police asked me something.

77
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:31,241
Police asked he's not just gambling, he's doing the dark stuff, too.

78
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,192
He was targeted.

79
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,458
I think so.

80
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:44,077
Takita Coal Mine will be bankrupt soon.

81
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:49,287
I know you know about this.

82
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,300
I'll stop by Kawashima Transport before going to the police.

83
00:13:02,881 --> 00:13:09,981
Kawashima Transport is the transportation company that handles all of our employees and brings them to Gozenyama Station.

84
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:18,058
The president of this company, Kawashima, is in and out of the police station all the time.

85
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:23,613
I was concerned about Okumura.

86
00:13:24,481 --> 00:13:27,834
So I went there on the evening of the 20th when he was taken to the police station to ask for help.

87
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:38,120
I'd say it's a game of hanafuda, but the other guys just got punched and came home.

88
00:13:38,698 --> 00:13:45,218
Anyway, they should be released as soon as possible without being interrogated too badly.

89
00:13:45,452 --> 00:13:49,545
Kawashima clearly knew that, didn't he?

90
00:13:52,528 --> 00:13:55,861
I heard he switched his hanafuda gambling to the dark side right away.

91
00:13:57,042 --> 00:14:01,555
They were buying up white rice and making rice cakes and sending them to the Tokyo area.

92
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,967
So I asked Director Shiozawa to let him go home early.

93
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:10,962
Are you sure about that, Mr. Kawashima?

94
00:14:12,782 --> 00:14:13,889
What do you mean?

95
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:20,446
Actually, Mr. Kawashima, I'm told that Okumura died suddenly this morning at the police station.

96
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:24,403
What?
He was dead?

97
00:14:29,923 --> 00:14:33,337
I'm sure police used violence.

98
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,130
Damn it. I asked them...

99
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,130
used violence?

100
00:14:40,996 --> 00:14:44,276
We can't take his body right away.

101
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:48,960
But We can't leave the corpse at the police station forever.

102
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:52,924
That's absurd.

103
00:14:56,512 --> 00:15:02,232
He's from Fukushima Prefecture. I sent a telegram this morning, but no one's come yet.

104
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:08,005
Anyway, until the bereaved family arrives, please keep his body here.

105
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,304
We're in trouble.
The autopsy is already done and the death certificate is in order.

106
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:24,389
I firmly and strongly insisted that We couldn't take his carcass home with us.
They insisted on taking it back.

107
00:15:27,223 --> 00:15:31,483
The police hired a car for us.

108
00:15:32,253 --> 00:15:36,966
Take it home with you no matter what!
Right now we're at war and we're both busy.

109
00:15:37,874 --> 00:15:39,848
Take care of it quickly and efficiently.

110
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:48,657
He said, "Isn't it your duty to do the work in the mines for the soldiers.

111
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:55,146
It can't be helped.

112
00:16:29,074 --> 00:16:32,794
By the way.
I thought you had to have a death certificate to be allowed to bury a body.

113
00:16:36,464 --> 00:16:39,924
Actually, this is...

114
00:16:48,288 --> 00:16:52,122
Cerebral hemorrhage...but It's a presumption.

115
00:16:53,456 --> 00:16:54,543
Yes, it is.

116
00:16:56,822 --> 00:17:01,148
Today is January 24th.
You buried his body on the 22nd.

117
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,160
It's only been two days.

118
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:12,910
Oh, Justice Minister?

119
00:17:13,785 --> 00:17:17,745
I'll take to Mr. Iwasaki, Minister of Justice, or Mr. Komori, Director of the Criminal Affairs Bureau.

120
00:17:19,015 --> 00:17:22,002
This is our attorney, Masaki Masaki of Masaki Law Offices.

121
00:17:22,969 --> 00:17:26,935
Yes that is me.

122
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,323
I'll visit you now.

123
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:33,742
Tell Komori that I'll visit him.

124
00:17:36,249 --> 00:17:38,449
Yes, thanks.

125
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:43,289
Will you handle the AOKURA Village case?

126
00:17:43,656 --> 00:17:45,369
Oh no, that's not necessary.

127
00:17:47,909 --> 00:17:50,256
But the cause of death is a bit odd.

128
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:54,249
The point is, once the authorities do a proper autopsy, they'll know for sure.

129
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,517
You know, I don't believe what police do.

130
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:00,747
But I believe D.A.'s office.

131
00:18:01,324 --> 00:18:04,364
They're all well educated and well mannered.

132
00:18:06,167 --> 00:18:07,394
I'll see what they take care of it.

133
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:11,084
I'm too busy, I can't handle this case.

134
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,896
Matsuda, Chief of the Criminal Division, welcomed Masaki at the Justice Department.

135
00:18:23,433 --> 00:18:30,433
The head of the Criminal Investigation Bureau, Mr. Komori, was not present at the meeting because he was with Minister Iwasaki, who was giving a speech to the Diet.

136
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:35,573
I understand the situation and the circumstances very well.

137
00:18:36,154 --> 00:18:37,721
I will consult with the Criminal Investigation Bureau Chief immediately.

138
00:18:38,121 --> 00:18:41,148
What I'd like to ask for is an autopsy.

139
00:18:41,272 --> 00:18:42,645
I understand perfectly.

140
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:45,293
I'll call you right back about that.

141
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,046
Thanks.

142
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:57,059
But the next day, the 25th, I still hadn't heard anything from them.

143
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:04,786
I'm a little concerned because I haven't heard back from them yet.

144
00:19:05,296 --> 00:19:08,096
If they don't do an autopsy soon, the body will rot.

145
00:19:08,717 --> 00:19:16,177
I want them to be clear.
If it's a brain hemorrhage, I can tell it to their family.

146
00:19:16,684 --> 00:19:17,737
So please.

147
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:22,017
I'm preparing the indictment now.

148
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:23,499
A indictment ?

149
00:19:25,546 --> 00:19:31,419
I mean, I don't have the right to demand an autopsy any sooner.

150
00:19:32,747 --> 00:19:37,207
For now,I am just at the stage of informing the authorities of the strange rumors.

151
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,460
So the interrogation of the previous four candidates for playing Hanafuda.

152
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:44,660
This is clearly an assault.

153
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:53,102
I would like to add to this the accusation that Okumura's death is strongly suspected to have been caused by an assault by a police officer.

154
00:19:54,901 --> 00:19:59,435
I don't know anything about it, but I'd appreciate your cooperation.

155
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:03,776
When will you go there?

156
00:20:04,122 --> 00:20:05,655
No, that won't be necessary.

157
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:09,967
All we need is an accurate autopsy.

158
00:20:10,566 --> 00:20:14,186
If you file a complaint, the authorities will take care of it.

159
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,240
It might be easier to do it this way.

160
00:20:24,176 --> 00:20:25,196
Hello? Masaki law office.

161
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,390
Oh Matsuda?

162
00:20:32,236 --> 00:20:34,056
Sorry for the late reply.

163
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:36,890
I've been trying to reach you by phone, but I'm too far away.

164
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:40,486
We have been assigned to the case.

165
00:20:42,277 --> 00:20:44,657
He is Prosecutor Tashiro of the Tokyo Appellate Court.

166
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,657
He is Prosecutor Tashiro of the Tokyo Appellate Court?

167
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:52,535
I'd like you to meet with him I'd like you to meet with him and discuss the situation in detail.

168
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:59,794
Well, thank you very much for your time.
I'll go to the D.A.'s office as soon as I can.

169
00:21:17,934 --> 00:21:19,174
I understand perfectly.

170
00:21:19,836 --> 00:21:22,496
Are you lawyer Masaki?
I've been expecting you.

171
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:33,696
We need the autopsy as soon as possible.

172
00:21:34,657 --> 00:21:38,110
You can't do anything if his body collapses.

173
00:21:49,072 --> 00:21:49,798
Hold on.

174
00:22:02,054 --> 00:22:04,401
He could show the complaint to his boss and discuss it with him.

175
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:06,321
I don't think so.

176
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:09,594
It's not big deal.

177
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:16,019
He'd just returned from Manchuria.

178
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:19,393
He doesn't fit in here yet.

179
00:22:21,469 --> 00:22:23,863
He's a little tense, isn't he?

180
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:37,116
Then I had to wait 10 or 15 minutes.

181
00:23:06,232 --> 00:23:07,865
All right, I'll explain the case.

182
00:23:08,282 --> 00:23:12,536
Well, before you do that, I'd like to ask you a few questions.

183
00:23:15,536 --> 00:23:21,343
How was this case brought to Masaki Law Office?

184
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,376
That's none of your business.

185
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:30,236
I have a responsibility as the prosecutor in charge.

186
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:36,477
But that's easy for me to say.

187
00:23:38,633 --> 00:23:48,300
Shizue Takita, who worked at the mine where the victim worked, knew Mr. Nomura of the Nomura Printing Studio and came to him for advice.

188
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:58,298
Mr. Nomura remembered me and consult with her because he was printing my magazine.

189
00:23:59,612 --> 00:24:01,638
That's all.

190
00:24:36,461 --> 00:24:41,575
He continues to ask as many questions as he needs to about the path he took on the case.

191
00:24:43,956 --> 00:24:46,836
Finally, it was over.

192
00:24:48,984 --> 00:24:51,211
I understand the pathway of the case very well.

193
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,047
Now, one more thing... about Masaki's relationship with the Justice Department.

194
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:06,019
Minister Iwasaki, Chief Komori, Chief Matsuda.

195
00:25:08,084 --> 00:25:12,804
Regarding your relationship with these people, are any of them relatives of yours?

196
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,987
What does that have to do with the case?

197
00:25:19,188 --> 00:25:22,108
I'm in charge of the case. I have a responsibility to hear everything.

198
00:25:30,542 --> 00:25:36,042
He goes on and on about the relationship between Masaki and the Justice Department.

199
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:41,298
He acted as if he were a prosecutor investigating a suspect.

200
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:45,145
I was starting to lose my patience.

201
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,366
Finally, that interrogation is over.

202
00:26:01,968 --> 00:26:03,615
You're an idiot, aren't you?

203
00:26:05,181 --> 00:26:10,895
I don't think it's necessary to ask something that has nothing to do with the case, no matter how many prosecutors are in charge of the case.

204
00:26:12,006 --> 00:26:15,725
When are you going to be there?

205
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:19,725
I would like to go tomorrow.

206
00:26:20,198 --> 00:26:20,831


207
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,277
If possible.

208
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,593
I'm a busy man, and this case is only about the autopsy.

209
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,190
If possible, I'd like you to bring the body to Tokyo.

210
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,696
That's all I ask.

211
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:42,136
I don't know if we'll do an autopsy or not.

212
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:48,023
Even if they were to do that, I can't tell you where they would do it.

213
00:27:04,439 --> 00:27:05,692
He's smart.

214
00:27:07,714 --> 00:27:09,874
They definitely only do dissections.

215
00:27:10,134 --> 00:27:10,767
I don't mean that.

216
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,827
Apparently, something I shouldn't trust, but have trusted too much so far.

217
00:27:24,868 --> 00:27:28,588
I'm going to the Ibaraki site tomorrow.

218
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:45,988
I never think everything is as it seems.

219
00:27:47,062 --> 00:27:50,282
But why do the people in the D.A.'s office behave like that?

220
00:27:51,632 --> 00:28:04,196
Are they the same people who, like the police, wield insidious power within the Japanese bureaucracy and taunt the people?

221
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:10,900
If so, I was too stupid not to have noticed it before.

222
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:17,765
No, it's not.
Because of the war.

223
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:22,873
This war is swamping all human good will and sense of justice.

224
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,257
Lawyer.

225
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:06,770
Lawyer.

226
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:21,353
(Kishimoto: We are on dissecting a corpse)

227
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,587
Isn't this telegram dated yesterday?

228
00:29:31,172 --> 00:29:32,625
The time was 6pm.

229
00:29:33,347 --> 00:29:37,100
It came to me late last night.

230
00:29:37,802 --> 00:29:39,529
Why you didn't tell me before we got on train?

231
00:29:40,847 --> 00:29:45,507
I'm sure we'll be there today, and they've already done his autopsy yesterday.

232
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:50,837
If I showed it to you,I thought you wouldn't go to Aokura.

233
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,011
But.

234
00:30:13,904 --> 00:30:22,507
Sir, in this case, I hate the man who had Okumura killed more than the police economist who killed him.

235
00:30:24,671 --> 00:30:29,051
As I told you the other day...
There's another coal mine in that village.

236
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:33,890
The manager there is good friends with the Yasui police officer stationed in the village who arrested Okumura.

237
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:42,554
YASUI gets rice, miso rolls, coal mines, lung liquor, and even clothing from Katayama.

238
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:46,974
They are very close now.

239
00:30:47,548 --> 00:30:52,468
That's why he's harassing us.

240
00:30:53,606 --> 00:30:57,399
And Okumura's arrest is really an attempt to destroy the Takita Coal Mine.

241
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:08,358
If an officer colludes with a contractor to do such a thing If an officer colludes with a contractor and goes to such lengths,

242
00:31:09,175 --> 00:31:11,022
there would be no more laws and the world would be a mess.

243
00:31:13,303 --> 00:31:18,489
Anyway, the autopsy was done yesterday.

244
00:31:21,703 --> 00:31:23,563
AOKURA will have to wait.

245
00:31:26,209 --> 00:31:31,622
Anyway, when we get to Mito, let's stop by the Mito Public Prosecutor's Office.

246
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,780
They destroyed evidence....

247
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:57,647
I'm fight with them to the end.

248
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,125
Are you Masaki lawyer?

249
00:32:44,911 --> 00:32:46,857
The autopsy was completed yesterday evening.

250
00:32:47,463 --> 00:32:49,223
He died of Brain hemorrhage.

251
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,339
Brain hemorrhage, as I thought.

252
00:32:58,879 --> 00:33:02,592
I just heard the report myself.

253
00:33:22,663 --> 00:33:23,743
He died of illness.

254
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:33,218
The autopsy results show that he died of a brain hemorrhage.

255
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:44,898
Thank you for everything, but this is a great relief for me.

256
00:33:45,794 --> 00:33:47,481
Now I can explain to their family.

257
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,453
Let's go to Aokura now.

258
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:10,582
We can see the river, and We climb along the river?

259
00:34:11,196 --> 00:34:16,763
Yes, this is the upper reaches of the river, but it is still about 8km from here.

260
00:34:44,153 --> 00:34:45,786
Are there any inns in Aokura?

261
00:34:45,893 --> 00:34:47,873
Yes, but only one.

262
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:53,043
I sent a telegram last night.
I'm sure they're all waiting for you there.

263
00:35:50,269 --> 00:35:55,069
The workers complained about the torture and assault of the policemen against them.

264
00:35:56,683 --> 00:36:02,209
It was almost an outpouring of sad indignation at something irresistible.

265
00:36:04,890 --> 00:36:08,197
And they spoke about the Okumura case.

266
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:11,165
He died of an assault, not a cerebral hemorrhage.

267
00:36:11,989 --> 00:36:13,775
He was killed.

268
00:36:13,855 --> 00:36:15,095
They are awful.

269
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:26,825
Who among you was present at the autopsy yesterday?

270
00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:39,355
He's Susumu Okumura, Okumura's younger brother.

271
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,895
He came from Fukushima.

272
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,387
You were present at the autopsy?

273
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:50,524
I was the only one allowed in the tent.

274
00:36:53,827 --> 00:36:56,134
Don't enter!

275
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:58,107
Don't enter!

276
00:37:30,021 --> 00:37:32,188
Were there any wounds anywhere on his body?

277
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,780
I wasn't sure.

278
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:41,296
But the autopsy surgeon showed me the inside of his head, where there was a lot of blood.

279
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:44,816
He said this was blood from a cerebral hemorrhage.

280
00:37:52,989 --> 00:37:54,435
So it was full of blood?

281
00:37:55,317 --> 00:37:58,390
Yes, it was full of red and black blood.

282
00:38:05,275 --> 00:38:05,855
What else?

283
00:38:06,509 --> 00:38:12,583
He had several red lines on his back that looked like he had been hit with a stick from the shoulder.

284
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:15,112
Red line?

285
00:38:26,241 --> 00:38:28,475
People can often do this line when people have a cerebral hemorrhage.

286
00:38:29,319 --> 00:38:32,554
These red bruises running from his shoulders to his back.

287
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:35,827
OK.

288
00:38:40,689 --> 00:38:41,400
What else?

289
00:38:45,517 --> 00:38:50,916
Before the autopsy, I was going through his pants, which he had been stripped of, and I found a sarumata pants.

290
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:54,080
You found a sarumata pants in his pants?

291
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:59,775
I had a similar experience with the police.

292
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:05,361
They made me sit in a cold cell for three hours.

293
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:08,330
And then?

294
00:39:27,279 --> 00:39:30,154
Now that the result has been decided, please ask the prosecutor.

295
00:39:42,857 --> 00:39:47,263
His cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage.
Please bury the body as soon as possible.

296
00:40:05,164 --> 00:40:10,812
His cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage.
Please bury the body as soon as possible.

297
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:14,312
Yes.

298
00:41:15,053 --> 00:41:17,905
I'd like to be alone for a minute, please.

299
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:30,168
I need to think.
I'd like to be alone.

300
00:42:54,361 --> 00:43:00,267
I stayed overnight in Aokura and went to the Osaki Police Station the next day, January 27.

301
00:43:03,267 --> 00:43:06,494
Anyone here?

302
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:10,510
What can we do for you?

303
00:43:12,603 --> 00:43:20,471
I'm Hiroshi Masaki, a lawyer in Tokyo who is investigating the case with the family of Noboru Okumura who died here in the detention center the other day.

304
00:43:22,158 --> 00:43:24,760
I'd like to meet the warden or the chief judicial officer.

305
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:27,822
The warden and the chief justice are both out of the office right now, but they're not.

306
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:33,424
Then when will they be back?

307
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:36,017
I have no idea...

308
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:45,546
I'll see Dr. Horimoto who wrote Okumura's death certificate first, please tell them so.

309
00:43:45,772 --> 00:43:46,460
I get it.

310
00:43:52,312 --> 00:43:58,015
What was the position of his hands and feet during the autopsy?
the position of the hands, the position of the feet...

311
00:43:59,867 --> 00:44:02,523
I don't remember about that.

312
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,028
So in any case, he was given very little in the way of anything resembling care for his injuries.

313
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:18,238
By the time I got there, there was nothing traumatic, but the pulse had already stopped and the trends had opened up, so there was no way to patch him up.

314
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:20,880
What about his body temperature?

315
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:22,520
His body temperature?

316
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:30,012
You said he was already cold.

317
00:44:32,161 --> 00:44:35,520
But I think his temperature was still somewhat warm.

318
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:39,801
Then the time of death isn't so clear.

319
00:44:43,536 --> 00:44:45,848
The night of the 20th, the night you arrived.

320
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:57,106
I immediately went to see Shiozawa, and asked him to let him go as soon as possible without any fuss.

321
00:44:57,825 --> 00:45:03,020
We met at a banquet that was convenient for us.

322
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:07,739
And the next night, the 21st, I told him once more

323
00:45:08,567 --> 00:45:15,965
There was a farewell party for a sergeant named Morikawa at Suzumuraya later that night, and we were together again, you know.

324
00:45:27,344 --> 00:45:29,297
Please tell me about him.

325
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:31,547
Takita coal's Okumura?

326
00:45:32,297 --> 00:45:34,485
How could I have asked you to do that yesterday?

327
00:45:38,978 --> 00:45:42,744
What's going on?

328
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:51,142
I've been in a bad mood all day.
I had a little too much to drink last night.

329
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:56,954
But he's a real hard-ass.

330
00:45:59,712 --> 00:46:08,368
I investigated him from morning to night, but he won't tell me anything honestly.

331
00:46:10,594 --> 00:46:13,524
This is different from what Mr. Yasui at the station said.

332
00:46:16,821 --> 00:46:21,079
Yasui reported something completely different to us.

333
00:46:21,610 --> 00:46:22,274
So?

334
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:28,532
He didn't approve, so I assaulted him.

335
00:46:54,169 --> 00:47:03,801
I wonder if Officer Yasui made up the story of Noboru Okumura's dark activities, as Takita Shizuku says.

336
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:27,072
In any case, Okumura stubbornly continued to deny everything during the interrogation on the following day, the 21st.

337
00:47:28,744 --> 00:47:32,174
Shiozawa, who was in a bad mood with a hangover, punched him.

338
00:47:36,565 --> 00:47:42,861
This provoked the fatal blow, and Okumura died at dawn on the 22nd.

339
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:15,189
There was no other way to prove this than to let the corpse, which had closed its mouth, speak again.

340
00:48:21,313 --> 00:48:25,938
Masaki and his team headed for Mito City after a preliminary survey of the area.

341
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:31,962
They were looking for Dr. Murota, who had performed the autopsy at the Seiryuji cemetery.

342
00:48:35,752 --> 00:48:40,150
Is the hemorrhage from inside the brain or outside?

343
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:48,205
Well, it's close to the outside.
There was a lot of bleeding, and it was full of coagulation.

344
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:53,619
I'm asking you again, the hemorrhage wasn't internal to the brain, was it?

345
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:58,072
No, the hemorrhage was near the exterior.

346
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:00,260
Did you take any autopsy photos?

347
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:02,869
No, I didn't.

348
00:49:13,924 --> 00:49:23,377
He was in no condition to have an apoplexy.
The fact that it happened so suddenly... You don't think there was a trigger?

349
00:49:24,025 --> 00:49:26,314
For example, cold or whatever.

350
00:49:27,744 --> 00:49:33,721
As far as I can tell, the arteries are a little stiffened, but that's all.

351
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:45,102
I'm busy, so I'll just leave it at that.

352
00:49:50,342 --> 00:49:56,240
Then I had no idea that the man I had autopsied was a police officer who had died a strange death.

353
00:50:03,863 --> 00:50:10,784
In the car on the way home I didn't know that until I asked Mr. Hashioka of the Mito District Public Prosecutors Office about it on the way home.

354
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:36,646
I assume you know the results of the autopsy.

355
00:50:38,404 --> 00:50:40,053
I know exactly what happened.

356
00:50:41,803 --> 00:50:44,803
But I'm afraid I can't tell you what it says.

357
00:50:47,451 --> 00:50:48,357
Why not?

358
00:50:50,477 --> 00:50:53,109
What right do you have to tell me that?

359
00:50:53,836 --> 00:50:54,672
Right?

360
00:50:58,375 --> 00:51:05,750
As far as the authorities are concerned, we found an odd body, so we just did an autopsy in accordance with Article 182 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

361
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:07,868
No, this needs to be reunited.

362
00:51:11,255 --> 00:51:12,028
No way.

363
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:20,919
There should be no connection between you and me.
If you're going to make such demands, why don't you just file a complaint?

364
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:30,744
I took a look at it the other day, if I recall.
Please, feel free to file an accusation or a complaint.

365
00:51:33,588 --> 00:51:37,143
It'll clear the air between you and me.

366
00:51:42,404 --> 00:51:54,138
If I file a complaint, he'll assume that the formal autopsy of this case is over, and he'll cut all ties with himself with a simple paperwork.

367
00:51:56,193 --> 00:51:57,349
What am I supposed to do then?

368
00:52:05,209 --> 00:52:12,389
I interviewed Professor Fukuhata, an authority in forensic science, through an introduction by my old friend, Professor Akiya.

369
00:52:14,021 --> 00:52:19,178
But the details of the case, the death by torture of a police officer, were not made clear.

370
00:52:20,896 --> 00:52:30,240
Your first question, general symptoms of death due to cerebral hemorrhage.
I'm not sure if the clause you're asking about applies to this, but it does not.

371
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:41,474
And your second question, in the case of a cerebral hemorrhage, whether or not there is massive bleeding on the underside of the brain, again, clearly there is no such accident.

372
00:52:42,178 --> 00:52:44,709
Then, can you appraise this corpse?

373
00:52:46,115 --> 00:52:52,060
No, the University of Tokyo cannot accept such a request from a private party.

374
00:52:55,934 --> 00:53:01,075
But the idea of taking these issues as far as they'll go as an individual is a thought.

375
00:53:02,653 --> 00:53:06,590
Times like this, you're putting yourself in a lot of danger.

376
00:53:06,942 --> 00:53:08,793
I mean...

377
00:53:13,937 --> 00:53:16,375
I'm not saying you should give up on anything.

378
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,890
There are limits to what an individual can do.

379
00:53:19,921 --> 00:53:24,374
You should borrow the help of a group.

380
00:53:24,812 --> 00:53:25,976
Borrow the help of a group?

381
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,625
This is a major human rights issue.

382
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:38,238
Saburo Miyazaki of the Grand Master's Tokyo Bar Association is the most passionate about human rights.

383
00:53:39,448 --> 00:53:45,519
I'm sure he'll be eager to take up the issue, so why don't you meet with Mr. Miyazaki.
Why don't you ask the Imperial Lawyers Association to take up the issue?

384
00:53:47,089 --> 00:53:49,480
I don't see any other way.

385
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:58,582
How can an individual be so proactive?

386
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:01,426
I understand very well.

387
00:54:02,566 --> 00:54:10,691
But, you see, the Imperial Bar Association is not supposed to take up non-members' proposals.

388
00:54:11,652 --> 00:54:20,933
But since the matter is so important, I'll make every effort to have it taken up at the meeting and I'll make sure it gets taken up.

389
00:54:22,949 --> 00:54:25,582
I see.
Thanks very much.

390
00:54:27,496 --> 00:54:33,246
However, it is not enough for you to tell me what you have told me.

391
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:41,805
I would like you to write a petition detailing the circumstances to date.

392
00:54:42,884 --> 00:54:45,423
Please do so as soon as possible, even if it takes a day or an hour.

393
00:55:03,823 --> 00:55:07,362
I started writing the petition on the morning of January 30th.

394
00:56:00,937 --> 00:56:02,086
Tea is ready.

395
00:56:55,618 --> 00:57:03,899
As I continued to write with a vigor that seemed to be possessed by something, I occasionally felt a huff of resistance to something that tugged at the bottom of my heart..

396
00:57:05,608 --> 00:57:09,350
Is it okay to be doing this?

397
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,636
I just kept writing.

398
00:57:43,034 --> 00:57:48,003
But I still felt a kind of uneasiness deep down inside me.

399
00:57:49,394 --> 00:57:53,308
I wonder if I'm doing the right thing

400
00:58:10,673 --> 00:58:17,446
I worked on the petition for 24 hours straight, finally finishing it in the morning of the 31st.

401
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:35,726
But as soon as I finished that last sentence, I realized for the first time exactly what it was that was so strangely stuck in the bottom of my heart that I could not get rid of it.

402
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:53,345
As of January 30, 1944, Okumura's body was buried in Okura Village, Nakahara County, Ibaraki Prefecture, but due to the cold weather in the area, it is expected to withstand autopsy for several more days.

403
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:14,848
I wonder if the corpse will survive the autopsy for a few days without corroding.

404
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:24,086
I mean, it's a cold place, but...

405
00:59:30,263 --> 00:59:34,842
That's fine.

406
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:39,209
Please typewrite about 25 right away.

407
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:48,209
The next regular board meeting is February 5, so I'll talk to the board members and make sure we take it up.

408
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:50,498
February 5th?

409
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:58,607
As you know, we are short-staffed.
And we can't get the forms.

410
01:00:00,021 --> 01:00:03,178
It will not be completed by February 4th.

411
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:12,251
But I will try my best to make it possible.

412
01:00:20,068 --> 01:00:24,420
You seem to be in a great hurry.

413
01:00:26,068 --> 01:00:30,498
I will try my best to make it possible.

414
01:00:32,738 --> 01:00:36,394
February 4th is too late.

415
01:00:38,949 --> 01:00:41,566
Once his corpse rots, it's all over.

416
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:53,931
I need police permission to exhume and dissect the body.

417
01:00:54,673 --> 01:00:57,267
But there's no need to do another autopsy.

418
01:00:58,181 --> 01:01:00,673
I just need to see what's already been dissected.

419
01:01:02,939 --> 01:01:06,009
He is currently undergoing temporary burial.

420
01:01:06,947 --> 01:01:16,009
I'm here to see Professor Fukuhata. Todai can't accept a request from a private party. I'll ask him to introduce us to a private forensic scientist with authority.

421
01:01:16,921 --> 01:01:22,195
And together we'll go to the cemetery in Aokura Village.

422
01:02:00,293 --> 01:02:06,739
Professor Fukuhata had already gone home and was no longer at the university.

423
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:21,798
I had no choice but to grasp at straws and pay a visit to Professor Minami, the world's leading authority on anatomy.

424
01:02:23,986 --> 01:02:30,431
The doctor in the country says it's a cerebral hemorrhage.

425
01:02:30,892 --> 01:02:32,541
A cerebral hemorrhage?

426
01:02:33,377 --> 01:02:36,634
This doctor is in cahoots with the other party, that's for sure.

427
01:02:37,884 --> 01:02:42,173
Is there any leading private forensic scientist who can give us a thorough evaluation?

428
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:45,619
Fukuhata here is the best.

429
01:02:45,767 --> 01:02:49,181
But Professor Fukuhata has gone home, and he's on a business trip tomorrow.

430
01:02:49,642 --> 01:02:52,298
You're in a great hurry.

431
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:56,244
I need it done an hour early, or that corpse will rot.

432
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:01,447
Well, then... Why don't you just bring me the head?

433
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:02,603
Just his head?

434
01:03:15,701 --> 01:03:23,693
Article 189 of the Penal Code
Exhumation of a corpse is punishable by imprisonment for up to two years

435
01:03:58,035 --> 01:04:02,949
Article 191. Committing the crime of exhuming a corpse

436
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:16,558
Those who destroy or steal the hair of a corpse or the remains of a corpse, or any other objects placed in the museum, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

437
01:04:27,594 --> 01:04:30,648
That's too much.

438
01:04:35,070 --> 01:04:47,246
Even if you succeed in getting what they owe, the local police will surely pay back Takita Mine even more than before.

439
01:04:54,746 --> 01:05:02,434
Sensei, the local Kishimoto wants to keep this incident to this level.

440
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:06,629
I have to think about everyone's life too.

441
01:05:07,989 --> 01:05:10,020
You don't have to do that.

442
01:05:16,702 --> 01:05:20,398
Masaki, you may already have someone following you.

443
01:05:24,484 --> 01:05:29,866
If you're discovered in the middle of your work, you'll be arrested on the spot.

444
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:44,561
Even if the work is successful, if it is discovered on the way to Tokyo, you will be arrested on the spot and the evidence will be taken away.

445
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:49,359
And this is the most important point.

446
01:05:49,944 --> 01:05:58,749
And if all of that were to work out, if the cause of death were a true cerebral hemorrhage, then what the hell would you do?

447
01:06:01,125 --> 01:06:03,688
You're wrong, obviously.

448
01:06:04,516 --> 01:06:08,086
You may be convinced that it's the right thing to do.

449
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:13,469
Justice is an action that's originally based on the most rational of minds.

450
01:06:14,336 --> 01:06:17,524
What you're trying to do is a gamble.

451
01:06:18,547 --> 01:06:22,008
If you fail, everything you've built will be destroyed.

452
01:06:22,789 --> 01:06:25,055
Your whole life will be ruined.

453
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:30,062
The body's rotting.

454
01:06:31,648 --> 01:06:35,773
I have to get the head soon.

455
01:06:50,230 --> 01:06:54,081
The body's rotting.

456
01:06:56,237 --> 01:07:00,151
I have to get the head soon.

457
01:07:02,646 --> 01:07:06,459
The body's rotting.

458
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:14,537
The corpse says I'm rotting.

459
01:07:16,037 --> 01:07:18,834
The corpse is telling me to cut off my head quickly.

460
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:28,835
It's not Okumura's body that's rotting away.

461
01:07:30,491 --> 01:07:37,499
It's my body, my mind, my heart that's rotting away.

462
01:08:02,739 --> 01:08:09,942
I'll get three tickets by 8:00 tomorrow morning and go to Ueno Station.

463
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:15,044
As you wish,
You can do whatever you want up there.

464
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,716
I don't care if I lose the Aokura mountains to do it.

465
01:08:48,174 --> 01:08:54,072
I knew that under no circumstances should I bother this Nakahara person.

466
01:08:55,525 --> 01:09:02,627
This man is a trainee in the Department of Anatomy at the University of Tokyo.

467
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:19,465
Yesterday, Professor Minami introduced me as an enemy appointee for the decapitation operation.

468
01:09:21,184 --> 01:09:26,012
Then this person doesn't know what the case is about.

469
01:09:26,778 --> 01:09:32,278
He doesn't even know if this is a university job.

470
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:38,309
He just was told to help me.

471
01:09:39,715 --> 01:09:43,192
If he knew the contents, he'd be an accomplice.

472
01:09:44,176 --> 01:09:46,505
I can't tell him anything.

473
01:10:03,830 --> 01:10:06,689
You may already have someone following you.

474
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:21,213
If you're discovered in the middle of your work, you'll be arrested on the spot.

475
01:10:51,299 --> 01:10:55,424
If you're discovered in the middle of your work, you'll be arrested on the spot.

476
01:11:54,896 --> 01:11:58,498
I just received Mr. Okumura's letter of approval.

477
01:12:00,424 --> 01:12:03,230
We will now re-examine his body.

478
01:12:07,518 --> 01:12:10,551
But this is an absolute secret.

479
01:12:11,984 --> 01:12:14,518
We should be careful.

480
01:12:17,831 --> 01:12:18,311
Ok?

481
01:12:19,954 --> 01:12:25,681
So you and you will go to the cemetery first.

482
01:12:27,637 --> 01:12:34,117
But you can't go through the village streets, because you'll be seen.
You'll have to go into the mountains behind the cemetery.

483
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:36,142
Ok?

484
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:43,195
We'll leave half an hour after you leave here.

485
01:12:44,606 --> 01:12:54,609
Then you will go ahead of us, and we will remove the soil from the cemetery and open the lid of the coffin so that we can do our work more easily.

486
01:12:59,824 --> 01:13:00,304
Good luck.

487
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:13,936
I knew it was you.

488
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:19,011
Looks like you had a visitor.

489
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:23,552
A client of mine is on his way to our mountain.

490
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,976
Oh he went there.

491
01:14:29,953 --> 01:14:34,353
I'm busy to prepare for cooking.

492
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:39,047
Excuse me.

493
01:15:05,263 --> 01:15:06,903
Get out from there.

494
01:15:22,455 --> 01:15:23,015
Get out from there.

495
01:16:19,754 --> 01:16:21,854
Now we're going to reexamine the body.

496
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:24,859
To do that, we are going to cut off the head of the corpse.

497
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,127
And then we'll bring the head back to Tokyo.

498
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:33,450
OK?
That's why We can't be seen by someone.

499
01:16:38,282 --> 01:16:39,302
Stand guard.

500
01:16:40,782 --> 01:16:42,908
You stand guard there!

501
01:16:44,078 --> 01:16:46,065
You should be careful.

502
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:47,725
Come on.

503
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,142
Open the bucket.

504
01:19:52,029 --> 01:19:52,796
Have a drink.

505
01:19:57,776 --> 01:19:58,389
Have a drink.

506
01:20:27,012 --> 01:20:32,219
Apparently, Officer Yasui from the police station noticed you're here.

507
01:20:34,013 --> 01:20:35,073
He must be coming here soon.

508
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:21,170
Don't be in a hurry.

509
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,907
Yeah.
He must be Masaki, who came here the other day to do some field work.

510
01:21:29,804 --> 01:21:32,483
He seems to be here.

511
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:41,648
He seemed he went to the mine for it.
I checked, he never went to the mountains.

512
01:21:43,801 --> 01:21:44,468
Yeah.

513
01:21:50,710 --> 01:21:57,244
He just passed by the station house, heading toward Mito.

514
01:22:01,935 --> 01:22:09,055
Robbers feel fear only when they make off with the goods rather than when they enter

515
01:22:10,635 --> 01:22:12,828
It was some strange realization.

516
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:22,901
we'll make it to Ueno Station for this 4:37 departure?

517
01:22:23,083 --> 01:22:26,576
I'm sure it'll be fine.

518
01:22:27,169 --> 01:22:29,255
Please make sure we catch that train.

519
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:40,900
Even if the work is successful, if it is discovered on the way to Tokyo, you will be arrested on the spot and the evidence will be taken away.

520
01:23:17,179 --> 01:23:18,385
Hurry up!

521
01:23:30,466 --> 01:23:33,032
Please make sure we catch that train.

522
01:23:34,762 --> 01:23:36,862
Looks like we will barely make it on time.

523
01:23:37,233 --> 01:23:38,580
So there's no shortcut?

524
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:40,717
There's no shortcut.

525
01:23:41,148 --> 01:23:43,555
Then the way to the next station after Mito is...

526
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:47,802
Yes, we can skip to Akatsuka, maybe we can make it in time.

527
01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:49,295
Please.

528
01:24:41,861 --> 01:24:43,161
Hurry up!

529
01:25:19,245 --> 01:25:20,058
Excuse me.

530
01:25:23,345 --> 01:25:23,998
Sorry.

531
01:25:51,843 --> 01:25:52,870
Please.

532
01:25:55,903 --> 01:25:56,396
Please.

533
01:25:56,421 --> 01:25:57,336
Your ID?

534
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:13,610
The police are searching our belongings.

535
01:27:01,962 --> 01:27:02,695
What's this.

536
01:27:03,242 --> 01:27:04,062
Lawyer.

537
01:27:21,075 --> 01:27:22,095
Who’s this?

538
01:27:23,049 --> 01:27:23,789
It's mine.

539
01:27:24,695 --> 01:27:25,755
What's in here?

540
01:27:29,103 --> 01:27:30,123
What's in here?

541
01:27:31,143 --> 01:27:33,509
It's not a black market item.

542
01:27:33,808 --> 01:27:35,768
I didn't ask you this.
Let's see what's in here.

543
01:27:37,214 --> 01:27:38,328
Open it.

544
01:27:40,329 --> 01:27:41,062
Hold on.

545
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:44,088
This isn't what we bought at the store.

546
01:27:44,601 --> 01:27:45,568
What's in here?

547
01:27:45,861 --> 01:27:46,947
The human head

548
01:27:48,748 --> 01:27:50,041
The human head?

549
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:54,941
Don't make fun of me!

550
01:27:59,292 --> 01:28:07,282
You can smell it in the warmth of this place... and it's kind of disgusting.

551
01:28:09,570 --> 01:28:11,890
I couldn't stop smelling something.

552
01:28:13,543 --> 01:28:16,717
It's the smell of fish... rotting fish bellies.

553
01:28:20,516 --> 01:28:25,003
Don't bring in those disgusting stuff.
Where are you going?

554
01:28:25,933 --> 01:28:26,620
Ueno.

555
01:28:27,393 --> 01:28:28,660
Get out from here.

556
01:28:29,716 --> 01:28:31,830
Don't you have any idea how much trouble you're causing the passengers?

557
01:28:34,593 --> 01:28:37,793
I was thinking of using it to fertilize my garden.

558
01:28:39,513 --> 01:28:40,540
Go.

559
01:29:05,972 --> 01:29:16,559
And if all of that were to work out, if the cause of death were a true cerebral hemorrhage, then what the hell would you do?

560
01:29:21,617 --> 01:29:26,390
Soon we'll be at Nippori.
I'm closer to home if I get off here.

561
01:29:28,516 --> 01:29:32,123
Thank you.

562
01:29:51,570 --> 01:29:54,550
Excuse me.
You must be Hiroshi Masaki, the lawyer.

563
01:29:55,234 --> 01:29:55,934
Yes.

564
01:29:56,559 --> 01:29:59,313
We are police.
Let us examine your belongings.

565
01:29:59,772 --> 01:30:01,792
You have no right to examine my stuff.

566
01:30:04,082 --> 01:30:06,442
You're only carrying that briefcase of yours, right?

567
01:30:07,462 --> 01:30:08,555
You'll know it when you see it.

568
01:30:10,856 --> 01:30:11,996
Nothing else?

569
01:30:12,496 --> 01:30:13,863
You'll know it when you see it.

570
01:30:16,322 --> 01:30:17,695
You guys are useless.

571
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:56,067
Oh Masaki.
You are here more than I thought.

572
01:30:56,859 --> 01:30:59,466
I made it hurry.

573
01:31:00,010 --> 01:31:01,357
How did it turn out?

574
01:31:01,790 --> 01:31:02,916
Good morning.

575
01:31:12,411 --> 01:31:15,884
It's been a long time since I've had dinner.

576
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:19,661
That mizutaki was very good.

577
01:31:22,074 --> 01:31:23,588
Fukuhata professor please.

578
01:31:26,305 --> 01:31:33,439
The lawyer, Hiroshi Masaki is here.

579
01:31:36,808 --> 01:31:42,421
He's brought one of his heads with him.
I'll send it over to you now, so please take a look at it.

580
01:31:43,709 --> 01:31:44,695
Please.

581
01:31:47,324 --> 01:31:50,197
I heard Professor Fukuhata doesn't take requests from the private sector.

582
01:31:50,264 --> 01:31:52,590
Don't worry.
Take that to the forensic science department.

583
01:31:56,065 --> 01:31:56,825
Please.

584
01:32:12,328 --> 01:32:13,181
Hanai.

585
01:32:21,368 --> 01:32:23,415
Take a look at this.

586
01:32:47,763 --> 01:32:52,763
Professor Fukuhata is still trying to avoid this stinking private appraisal.

587
01:33:21,045 --> 01:33:22,359
Professor Fukuhata won't examine this.

588
01:33:23,582 --> 01:33:28,516
After all that washing, there's no more evidence.

589
01:33:41,056 --> 01:33:46,149
There is a large subcutaneous hemorrhage 4 cm behind the base of the left strong root.

590
01:33:57,704 --> 01:34:04,904
There is also a large subcutaneous hemorrhage on the right frontal surface of the brain with significant red blood vessel hemorrhaging.

591
01:34:06,377 --> 01:34:11,264
There's an almost identical hemorrhage on the left temporal surface.

592
01:34:27,321 --> 01:34:30,275
This is traumatic.

593
01:34:34,656 --> 01:34:37,983
This is not a brain hemorrhage.

594
01:34:40,224 --> 01:34:42,857
This is clearly a beating.

595
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:28,312
It worked well.

596
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:35,317
Now I'm afraid I may have put the brakes on you a bit too much.

597
01:35:37,387 --> 01:35:43,652
Justice is not so much about rational thought as it is about doing what is necessary, when it is necessary, and to the best of one's ability.

598
01:35:45,270 --> 01:35:47,184
This may be it.

599
01:35:50,488 --> 01:35:53,473
But Masaki...

600
01:35:54,848 --> 01:35:57,090
But I'm afraid I'm still thinking...

601
01:36:00,551 --> 01:36:09,066
I understand that when we think only rationally, we tend to become selfish and even righteousness gets lost in the process.

602
01:36:11,859 --> 01:36:16,359
But I still have something to say about what you've done.

603
01:36:19,187 --> 01:36:22,968
What exactly am I trying to say to you?

604
01:36:27,917 --> 01:36:31,581
I'm talking about your future.

605
01:36:33,698 --> 01:36:41,440
I have a feeling that what you've done might change who you are.

606
01:36:44,496 --> 01:36:49,239
Everything is at war.
It's because we're at war that we're seeing these terrible violations of human rights.

607
01:36:52,262 --> 01:37:00,551
I don't know in what way.
As long as the war is over, there will never be another incident like this again.

608
01:37:01,911 --> 01:37:04,145
I don't think I need to worry about it.

609
01:37:08,575 --> 01:37:15,121
The head of this unfortunate victim was in the Department of Forensic Medicine at the University of Tokyo for about a month afterwards.

610
01:37:16,465 --> 01:37:22,356
At the request of the court officials, it was moved to the Keio University School of Medicine's Department of Forensic Medicine.

611
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:31,379
Professor Nakazato of Keio University's opinion was completely the same as that of Professor Fukuhata of Tokyo University.

612
01:37:32,661 --> 01:37:36,871
What happened next was a long, long story.

613
01:37:38,309 --> 01:37:46,262
In the end, the head was determined to be a murder by assault by a police officer, and the case was closed.

614
01:37:47,856 --> 01:37:49,950
This is commonly referred to as the "Headless Case.

615
01:37:54,590 --> 01:38:04,809
However, in an air raid on May 25, 1945, the head was burned in flames, signaling the end of the war.

616
01:38:17,177 --> 01:38:21,982
Ten years later.
Masaki has remained strangely unchanged.

617
01:38:23,154 --> 01:38:24,888
He's exactly the same as he was ten years ago.

618
01:38:26,781 --> 01:38:36,961
In contrast, the war may be over, but the mechanisms and workings of the world may not have changed all that much.

619
01:39:01,192 --> 01:39:07,067
They say the murder weapon was an axe used to chop wood. The victim, Soichi Hayakawa, bled to death.

620
01:39:08,161 --> 01:39:11,629
Something that big couldn't have done more damage than this.

621
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:23,497
The murder weapon in this case was not a wood chipper, but a single-edged knife.

622
01:39:26,093 --> 01:39:31,976
The first hit is like this, and the victim reflexively does this.

623
01:39:41,872 --> 01:39:51,044
THE END

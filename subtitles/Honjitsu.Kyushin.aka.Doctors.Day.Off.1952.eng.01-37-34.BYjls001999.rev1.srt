<i>Honjitsu Kyushin / Doctor's Day Off (1952)</i>

3
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:37,384
I started business here 18 years ago

4
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,230
Of course, my hospital was burned down.

5
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,508
But after the war,
I welcomed the elderly Gosuke as director and restarted my hospital

6
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:48,856
It has been exactly one year since then.

7
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,946
Tomorrow is our first anniversary, and we will be holding a pre-celebration event.

8
00:01:56,622 --> 00:02:00,535
We will be putting up a sign saying that we are closed.

9
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,067
I want to take a nice long nap and relax.

10
00:02:06,443 --> 00:02:07,283
Baya,Kyo too.

11
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,069
I will be taking a nap today too

12
00:02:10,525 --> 00:02:14,534
Nurse Taki says I want to go somewhere, maybe Hakone or Atami

13
00:02:14,605 --> 00:02:15,379
Same here.

14
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:17,298
I'd also like to take a relaxing bath in the hot springs

15
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:21,812
but Director Gosuke is against it

16
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,775
If you go to Hakone Atami, It's too far.

17
00:02:27,043 --> 00:02:29,036
Doctor.

18
00:02:30,168 --> 00:02:33,182
I took their vote.

19
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:37,909
You should enjoy lots of entertainment.

20
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,241
Go to hot spring.

21
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,513
The next morning the group set out while it was still dark

22
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:49,064
Gosuke ended up to agree to trip to a hot spring

23
00:03:01,477 --> 00:03:03,910
I'm here to order you.

24
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:26,852
Our soldiers do their best to be polite.

25
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,870
Our soldiers do their best to be polite.

26
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:35,313
Our soldiers do their best to fight.

27
00:03:35,893 --> 00:03:37,953
Our soldiers do their best to fight.

28
00:03:45,634 --> 00:03:46,521
Doctor.

29
00:03:48,524 --> 00:03:49,271
Doctor.

30
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,001
What happened?

31
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,620
Yusaku has another seizure.

32
00:03:54,872 --> 00:03:56,212
Again?

33
00:03:56,499 --> 00:03:58,739
Our soldiers...

34
00:03:59,399 --> 00:04:01,164
Hey, which group are you belonging?

35
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:04,336
Come here

36
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:08,338
What's the hell?

37
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:10,432
You against me?

38
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:14,477
Stop it.

39
00:04:15,003 --> 00:04:18,788
don't be violent.

40
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,113
Hey, hit this solider.

41
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,610
Give me a break

42
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,480
Whoever it is, he's a lunatic

43
00:04:30,056 --> 00:04:33,783
Leader, it's a general enemy operation

44
00:04:35,433 --> 00:04:37,453
Sorry he's my son.

45
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,210
He became like that after his head was damaged in the war

46
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,174
Be careful.

47
00:04:42,546 --> 00:04:48,140
The 22nd mission,the boobs is something...

48
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,144
OK OK.

49
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:56,629
Hey, you can lie down under this tree

50
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,517
Leader,The operation failed.

51
00:04:59,542 --> 00:05:00,177
Shut up!

52
00:05:00,453 --> 00:05:02,140
You always lie down under this tree

53
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,266
and your right heel resting on it, taking a comfortable nap

54
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:09,530
Try doing that in front of me

55
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:10,902
Yes,

56
00:05:14,984 --> 00:05:17,171
Stay like that.

57
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:22,413
doctor..

58
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:35,881
Doctor, Can you cure him?

59
00:05:36,126 --> 00:05:37,699
That disease is impossible to cure.

60
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,576
He's the only child.

61
00:05:40,738 --> 00:05:44,764
You're even happy.
He's back from war. He came back alive,

62
00:05:45,392 --> 00:05:47,122
I lost my only son.

63
00:05:55,632 --> 00:05:56,685
 Shut up

64
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,648
It's a holiday today,

65
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:08,500
so who's there? The clinic is closed today

66
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,254
I'm Matsuki.

67
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:15,488
I'm the Matsuki Police.

68
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,493
Any care happened?

69
00:06:18,165 --> 00:06:19,976
Sorry,
but please exam for a moment

70
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,637
This girl?

71
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:23,450
Yes.

72
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,324
She was attacked by someone.

73
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,369
came in

74
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,301
Come in.

75
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:25,382
When was it happened?

76
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,248
Last night.

77
00:07:27,065 --> 00:07:30,378
this girl came from Osaka

78
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:31,595
Osaka?

79
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,767
Apparently she came to visit a friend who lives
in an apartment.

80
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,333
No matter how hard she looked, she couldn’t find the apartment.

81
00:08:29,622 --> 00:08:32,845
She asked a passerby, and

82
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:39,599
Oh that is...

83
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,420
There.

84
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:50,594
that's exactly wrong direction.

85
00:08:53,479 --> 00:08:55,699
Is it heavy?
Shall I help you?

86
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:57,753
Don't worry.

87
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,148
Don't be hesitate.

88
00:09:45,567 --> 00:09:46,210
She's gone?

89
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,556
You have no choice

90
00:09:55,123 --> 00:09:56,790
Come with me.

91
00:10:01,062 --> 00:10:03,592
Don't speak up.

92
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:09,575
I'll give you this.

93
00:10:09,656 --> 00:10:10,435
Watch?

94
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:45,526
That's all what you told me?

95
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,262
This woman is quite tight-lipped and wouldn't even tell
me the name of the apartment.

96
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,278
She said that she had a terrible experience

97
00:10:53,303 --> 00:10:54,685
and that she can no longer see that person

98
00:10:58,185 --> 00:11:01,526
That person is your lover?

99
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,562
Is that so?

100
00:11:03,593 --> 00:11:12,658
Let me examine her. Thank you

101
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,262
What a terrible.

102
00:11:18,426 --> 00:11:20,384
Let me examine

103
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:21,424
No.

104
00:11:21,736 --> 00:11:27,626
If you don't examine , there won't be any evidence when the culprit is caught

105
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,922
I don't need.

106
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:33,627
No.

107
00:11:41,294 --> 00:11:48,510
That's troubling. You're worrying so much.
Stand up.

108
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,152
Let's do dissolution.

109
00:12:05,775 --> 00:12:06,555
Matsuki.

110
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,845
You look nice.

111
00:12:11,112 --> 00:12:12,646
Did you practice at the police station while you were asleep?

112
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:13,407
Sorry.

113
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,615
Have you done the exam yet?

114
00:12:15,926 --> 00:12:18,212
I told her how to care

115
00:12:18,685 --> 00:12:21,441
Is that ok?
I worry if she kill herself.

116
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,930
She's crying.

117
00:12:33,665 --> 00:12:34,812
I feel sorry.

118
00:12:36,612 --> 00:12:37,925
I'll make a tea for her.

119
00:12:38,677 --> 00:12:39,805
I'm afraid this is going to be a long battle

120
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:42,919
Sorry for making this on your holiday.

121
00:12:44,888 --> 00:12:46,348
Again.

122
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,696
Excuse me.

123
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,937
Who?

124
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:57,387
I'd like to see that doctor,

125
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,694
 but he's closed

126
00:12:59,351 --> 00:13:01,371
But I need.

127
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:02,364
 but he's closed

128
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:03,637
I need.

129
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:06,274
He's closed today.

130
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:13,436
Wow, it's been a while, Doctor

131
00:13:16,103 --> 00:13:17,423
Who is it?

132
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:21,291
You forgot?
I am Yukawa.

133
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,525
Michiyo Yukawa?

134
00:13:23,823 --> 00:13:26,895
I just returned from the site

135
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:35,546
She was the first patient to come in on the day I opened my practice here 18 years ago.

136
00:13:35,848 --> 00:13:37,934
Please come in.

137
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:46,109
Have a seat.

138
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,982
Thanks for the other day.

139
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:53,505
That was a lot of work for you, so please have a seat.

140
00:13:55,055 --> 00:13:59,610
It was a long time ago, but I still remember it clearly. It was around noon

141
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:02,387
You were on a board

142
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,891
Did she get hurt?

143
00:14:03,915 --> 00:14:06,280
It's called a Caesarean section

144
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,543
Of course it's important.

145
00:14:07,568 --> 00:14:12,859
She was a first-time patient. I want to help
her. I took up meditation with all my heart

146
00:14:13,325 --> 00:14:15,385
I held the fetus in my hand.

147
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:19,070
Grab that leg and pull it up. It's no longer a fetus,  it's a baby

148
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:20,340
The baby cried

149
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,850
It's ok now

150
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,710
Two lives were saved, a mother and her child. I was moved to tears

151
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:29,650
The child is now 19

152
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,063
That's awesome.

153
00:14:41,834 --> 00:14:45,235
Actually, the Doctor's son told me

154
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,892
I have brought the bill that was left untouched at that time

155
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,013
You've brought the bill for a patient from 18 years ago?

156
00:14:51,417 --> 00:14:53,855
I brought it.

157
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,400
So I'm embarrassed

158
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,793
How much was it?

159
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,501
Yes, it was 240 yen.

160
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,028
Do you work now?

161
00:15:00,406 --> 00:15:04,830
I'm collecting light items.
My son works as a waiter for the company

162
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,795
Don't worry.

163
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,108
I have to pay.

164
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,114
My son earn this money and told me to bring here.

165
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:17,412
You saved our life and I will pay you, he said.

166
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:20,465
I see.
I think his named me Shunzo.

167
00:15:20,815 --> 00:15:23,342
You named it.

168
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,750
Thank you so much for  taking the time to give it to me

169
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,460
And doctor, there is a letter inside from him?

170
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:31,179
Letter?

171
00:15:31,945 --> 00:15:35,058
He like to write letters.

172
00:15:35,495 --> 00:15:39,085
Whenever he as free time, he write letters and send them.

173
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,627
Oh, that's what they call letter mania

174
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,084
Is it an illness?

175
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,731
It's a hobby, a pastime

176
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,540
We went around together again today

177
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,160
He thinks a letter would be better than meeting you

178
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,905
He's in front of here.

179
00:15:53,273 --> 00:15:55,657
I see, it's a mania

180
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,900
This is the roman alphabet

181
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:12,216
Yes, when he has free time at work, he types on the typewriter

182
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:22,780
I think my mother had the surgery done by you...

183
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:32,190
and was born in a mysterious way like Momotaro.

184
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,776
I'm glad I was born or

185
00:16:35,165 --> 00:16:42,795
it would have been better if I had never been born...

186
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:53,200
I would say it's good that I was born. Thank you.

187
00:17:03,168 --> 00:17:05,729
Is it already done? There's nothing wrong

188
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,375
What happened last night wasn't your fault

189
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,771
I was bitten by a crazy person

190
00:17:14,293 --> 00:17:16,126
I'm leaving.

191
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,843
Cheer up

192
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:22,727
What happened?

193
00:17:22,752 --> 00:17:26,791
Some young people were playing a prank on her

194
00:17:36,998 --> 00:17:38,125
See you.

195
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:39,875
See you.

196
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:11,902
This is tough business.

197
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:20,694
Hey

198
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:27,236
Hey, this ship called KiteMaru?

199
00:18:29,169 --> 00:18:31,669
Is this the ship with the sick person?

200
00:18:32,233 --> 00:18:36,647
Thank you for your hard work. I was waiting to see

201
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:39,077
I don't even know what it's like?

202
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:42,209
She often gets dizzy

203
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,439
Because of postpartum

204
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,072
Okay, look, I'll take a look

205
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:48,112
Be careful.

206
00:18:48,137 --> 00:18:49,085
Thanks.

207
00:18:55,245 --> 00:18:58,525
It's narrow?

208
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:01,732
How're you?

209
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,490
Do you get a headache?

210
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,447
It's especially bad on cloudy days

211
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:18,509
Is it necessary to keep the ceiling closed during the day?

212
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,887
I have a strange thing to ask

213
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,700
Hey, this ship is sometimes used for gambling, so that's why the ceiling is set

214
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,679
I'm not part of it 'cause I've got the baby out the whole time

215
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:46,286
The ceiling is closed so it's stuffy.

216
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:53,658
when you give birth,you will go to the village, it's too cramped on the ship

217
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:59,031
Doctor, if I'm not here, it's worrying

218
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:04,251
She thinks I go play often.

219
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:09,779
Take care.

220
00:20:10,462 --> 00:20:12,673
See you tomorrow night.

221
00:20:12,874 --> 00:20:13,620
Hold on.

222
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,456
This is something small.

223
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,166
but it's a souvenir

224
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:27,715
Thanks.

225
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,500
I'm keeping quiet about the gambling

226
00:20:29,525 --> 00:20:30,627
Thanks.

227
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,009
Oh my, what a waste!

228
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:41,990
Who was that?

229
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,287
Who was that?

230
00:20:50,694 --> 00:20:51,863
The doctor is here, right?

231
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:54,095
He's not here.

232
00:20:54,152 --> 00:21:05,175
He'll probably be back soon. I'll have to wait

233
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,110
Today is a holiday

234
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,527
I know,

235
00:21:08,813 --> 00:21:09,833
Omachi.

236
00:21:11,298 --> 00:21:14,060
let's go home, don't cut your finger.

237
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:15,502
You go home.

238
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,509
Please let's go home

239
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,865
You go home.

240
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,601
Please stop it

241
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,241
No.

242
00:21:31,872 --> 00:21:33,460
then do as you please

243
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,908
Do whatever you like.

244
00:21:35,932 --> 00:21:43,245
So you're mad? Don't be mad

245
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,874
Doctor, I want you to give
me an anesthetic injection.

246
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:57,702
anesthetic injection?

247
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:02,203
Please stop it.

248
00:22:02,507 --> 00:22:03,394
It's none of your business.

249
00:22:04,927 --> 00:22:06,845
there was some kind of happening?

250
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:09,034
So you cut off your fingers.

251
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,399
It's obligation.

252
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:11,652
 It's painful

253
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:15,010
Yakuza world is hard, come in.

254
00:22:15,035 --> 00:22:15,668
Doctor.

255
00:22:15,721 --> 00:22:16,987
ladies, stay away

256
00:22:22,115 --> 00:22:23,575
Have a seat.

257
00:22:24,922 --> 00:22:26,769
You are with Sai?

258
00:22:27,504 --> 00:22:29,303
No, just a woman.

259
00:22:29,504 --> 00:22:30,611
She's a mistress?

260
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,271
Your name is?

261
00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:38,436
Kakichi

262
00:22:38,981 --> 00:22:39,748
How old?

263
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,581
I'm 24 years old,

264
00:22:41,656 --> 00:22:48,450
Kakichi-kun. My son was also 24 when his finger gets cut

265
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,366
So he was a playboy after all?

266
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:51,896
in battle field.

267
00:22:52,468 --> 00:22:54,201
He died in battle

268
00:22:54,619 --> 00:22:56,052
In the Burma.

269
00:22:57,557 --> 00:23:07,631
A comrade who survived cut off his little finger, put it
in a bonfire, turned it into bones, put it in a container, and brought it back to me

270
00:23:10,505 --> 00:23:16,235
If I shake the container like this, it makes a rattling noise

271
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:20,313
The sound of bones is a lonely sound.

272
00:23:33,351 --> 00:23:34,959
How's Your parents?

273
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:36,886
They live in the countryside

274
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:42,169
If you cut your finger, I recommend putting a container
of Mentholatum in it and sending it off to them.

275
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,541
I'm sure your mother will do like this

276
00:23:50,412 --> 00:23:53,342
I am not here to listen about it.
I need the injection.

277
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:56,093
Oh I’m sorry.

278
00:23:57,564 --> 00:23:58,458
Doctor.

279
00:23:58,758 --> 00:23:59,258
What?

280
00:23:59,477 --> 00:24:00,700
Look at this.

281
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:07,932
75000...sorry We are closed today.

282
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:26,258
Can you please think about it again?

283
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:30,950
Which is more important, your fingers or your obligations?

284
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,528
I don't wanna make a mistake.

285
00:24:35,553 --> 00:24:36,426
so if you don't like it, that's fine

286
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,620
There's more than one doctor here

287
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,787
Are you going to another clinic?

288
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,220
I can't stand the obligation

289
00:24:47,442 --> 00:24:50,600
But I'll think about it again

290
00:25:03,819 --> 00:25:04,934
Let's go home.

291
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:09,775
Dinner is ready

292
00:25:10,185 --> 00:25:11,854
Let's have a drink and go to bed.

293
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,905
Then I got a call from the police

294
00:25:13,992 --> 00:25:14,905
from the police?

295
00:25:15,078 --> 00:25:17,167
Apparently someone suddenly fell ill at the police jail.

296
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,004
I can't have a drink...

297
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:22,758
I got eggs. Look!

298
00:25:26,657 --> 00:25:27,837
This is broken.

299
00:25:35,594 --> 00:25:41,836
Is it stylish? This is nice

300
00:25:42,882 --> 00:25:44,409
Can I have my hair cut too?

301
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,458
Please…

302
00:25:49,134 --> 00:25:50,944
It won't take times?

303
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,059
Please…

304
00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:54,065
Sure

305
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:06,121
Thank you for your hard work.

306
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,387
Apparently someone is sick

307
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,678
I think she was faking it.

308
00:26:10,729 --> 00:26:14,154
Today is a holiday, What's the hell?

309
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:20,948
Even if you know it's a fake, you need to examine.

310
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,116
This is the woman who was with the criminal last night

311
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,083
Did you catch the culprit?

312
00:26:29,357 --> 00:26:34,933
I caught it by myself, but it was so hard.

313
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,487
The main culprits and accomplices are the tough guys.

314
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:41,029
It was hard.

315
00:26:41,229 --> 00:26:42,356
A hat was a clue.

316
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:49,541
According to the victim's testimony, the criminal was wearing a hat with the top flattened.

317
00:26:53,465 --> 00:27:00,209
It was around noon and I saw the man and
the woman with it in front of the market

318
00:27:09,321 --> 00:27:12,480
The moment we passed each other, I felt something.

319
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,564
I doubted them.

320
00:27:16,244 --> 00:27:17,717
I'm hungry

321
00:27:18,946 --> 00:27:25,108
I followed them for a while and noticed that they had gotten away

322
00:27:27,569 --> 00:27:30,127
Stop!
There is something I want to ask you.

323
00:27:31,001 --> 00:27:32,208
Thief!

324
00:27:34,176 --> 00:27:36,230
Wait, somebody catch that woman!

325
00:27:53,027 --> 00:27:54,714
Help me.

326
00:27:56,138 --> 00:27:57,358
Damn it.

327
00:28:02,837 --> 00:28:06,070
I wonder if...

328
00:28:06,871 --> 00:28:10,298
They are the criminals?

329
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:17,629
It hurts.

330
00:28:24,176 --> 00:28:25,509
It hurts.

331
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:27,575
She's always like that.

332
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,821
When she entered the detention, she suddenly
complained of stomach pain and I had to let her rest

333
00:28:30,987 --> 00:28:33,740
She shouted that it was a violation of human rights

334
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,207
It's democracy

335
00:28:37,636 --> 00:28:39,422
Anyway, please check her out.

336
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,110
Let me see what's wrong

337
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:51,889
It hurts so much?

338
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,206
That's strange, your pulse is
normal and you don't have a fever,

339
00:29:00,395 --> 00:29:03,947
but doctor, it hurts

340
00:29:06,633 --> 00:29:07,746
It hurts.

341
00:29:08,528 --> 00:29:10,022
Stick out your tongue.

342
00:29:10,688 --> 00:29:14,520
it's a nice color.
You have a nice tongue.

343
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,145
It hurts.

344
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:32,910
I've already done

345
00:29:33,194 --> 00:29:34,761
Hold on.

346
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,080
 there's no need to embarrass a woman.

347
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,950
Is this a temptation? Stripping is not uncommon for doctors

348
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:42,760
Are you going home now?

349
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:44,655
I can't cure your fake illness

350
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,266
What's about the faking?

351
00:29:47,347 --> 00:29:51,655
You won't know if you like the sound unless you try hitting  the drums.

352
00:29:51,810 --> 00:29:55,007
It's a violation of human rights to pretend to
be ill without even a proper medical examination

353
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,629
You are idiot doctor.

354
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:17,649
Have you done it?

355
00:30:28,545 --> 00:30:29,225
She?

356
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:30,969
She's  called in as a witness.

357
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,401
Is she going back to Osaka?

358
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:42,445
She's saying she can't go back to Osaka anymore

359
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:44,680
So she's staying with Yukawa for a while.

360
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,087
Yukawa?

361
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,812
She went to your clinic  this morning, right?

362
00:30:49,229 --> 00:30:51,515
She really felt sorry for that girl

363
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,654
She said she'd stop her if she had nowhere to go.

364
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:02,357
Where is Yukawa house?

365
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:04,461
It's the tenement house behind the police box.

366
00:31:05,735 --> 00:31:07,411
It's near Baya's house

367
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,837
That's right. It's on the outskirts of that tenement house

368
00:31:18,104 --> 00:31:20,721
It's that guy. That guy is the culprit.

369
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:30,972
Hey, there are scars on your forehead

370
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,896
I'll take care of you

371
00:31:35,576 --> 00:31:41,391
Look, here is a wound, here is one too

372
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,995
Here too.

373
00:31:44,805 --> 00:31:46,305
I'll take care of you

374
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,047
Hey, why did you that?

375
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,160
Poor thing

376
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,940
The dreams of young girls have not been cruelly crushed by you.

377
00:31:54,965 --> 00:31:57,952
People like you, it's best to go to the jail.

378
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,541
Please go to the hospital and fix that posture

379
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,673
I would hit you.

380
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:07,620
Idiot.

381
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:11,500
I just got a call from home

382
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:13,855
It seems that a Patients with appendicitis was carried out again

383
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,235
We are closed today.

384
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,016
Baya also refused, but someone was curried.

385
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:21,846
What?
That's breaking and entering.

386
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,045
Anyway, Doctor is not staying home

387
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:27,830
There's a clinic ahead called Yokota, so please go that way

388
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,623
But they said.

389
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:34,863
They looked at my appearance.
The room was full

390
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:36,509
Is here too?

391
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,780
I'll wait.

392
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:45,759
Stay strong, I guess I'll make you easier

393
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,617
I don't want to get you too comfortable though

394
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:54,102
What's wrong?

395
00:32:54,589 --> 00:32:55,849
Doctor

396
00:32:56,002 --> 00:32:58,715
I thought I'd ask you to do (surgical) operation.

397
00:32:59,968 --> 00:33:02,479
Wait please

398
00:33:02,641 --> 00:33:04,760
Wait, today is a holiday and there are no nurses

399
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,960
It's none of my business.

400
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,210
I was a medic in the military

401
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:11,329
So I can assist you.

402
00:33:16,196 --> 00:33:18,095
This looks like a lot of pain

403
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,653
When did she become ill?

404
00:33:21,678 --> 00:33:23,658
She often get caecum.

405
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,599
But this time it happened again and it's been so serious.

406
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:31,004
Did you leave it alone?

407
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:34,262
She tried to heal herself.

408
00:33:34,486 --> 00:33:35,496
She was drinking a lot.

409
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:36,721
What did she drink?

410
00:33:37,007 --> 00:33:39,674
It's a burdock and carrot drink.

411
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,220
According to her

412
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:44,580
Chickweed waters the rotten appendix

413
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,282
The burdock turned that water into gas

414
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:50,809
I don't know it works.

415
00:33:50,964 --> 00:33:53,117
Yeah.

416
00:33:57,231 --> 00:33:59,031
Come on.

417
00:33:59,485 --> 00:34:02,659
Be careful.

418
00:34:03,344 --> 00:34:04,910
Turn to the right

419
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:13,744
Call Yokota clinic and borrowed a nurse.

420
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:16,927
It must be hard for you.

421
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:21,220
It can't be helped, it's a business that takes responsibility for people's lives

422
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,333
I'll get another half

423
00:34:31,371 --> 00:34:34,023
Doctor, You drunk a lot tonight

424
00:34:34,048 --> 00:34:35,657
I'll get another half

425
00:34:36,765 --> 00:34:40,177
I was unlucky today.

426
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:47,052
She's home.

427
00:34:50,614 --> 00:34:53,619
where did you go? You're late

428
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,757
What? Momotaro ? Shunzo is here

429
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:01,664
Good evening,

430
00:35:02,449 --> 00:35:03,822
what do you want to do, Shunzo?

431
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,160
SOS

432
00:35:05,424 --> 00:35:07,071
SOS?

433
00:35:07,544 --> 00:35:09,497
Mr. Kozuka will be a birth.

434
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:11,010
The midwife came but

435
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,150
The baby hasn't been born, so I was asked for help

436
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,183
The baby is too big.

437
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,908
She has left now.

438
00:35:19,595 --> 00:35:21,242
SOS.

439
00:35:21,554 --> 00:35:22,607
Where it is?

440
00:35:22,632 --> 00:35:24,147
It's in the neighborhood.

441
00:35:24,172 --> 00:35:27,755
You are drunk now.

442
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,860
It's SOS.

443
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:34,998
Doctor.

444
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,492
Baya.

445
00:35:37,186 --> 00:35:40,140
Something might have happened

446
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,716
I got sick of it, seriously

447
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,475
Then, Doctor, Yoko said hello

448
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:53,647
I hear she's already causing trouble for you

449
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:55,554
I respect her.

450
00:35:55,855 --> 00:35:56,401
What?

451
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:00,102
Yuko is a typist who types 100 words per minute

452
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:08,050
It's so fast!

453
00:36:08,989 --> 00:36:12,647
Writing letters with typewriter is your hobby

454
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,660
So I'm going to have Yuko bring to my company

455
00:36:18,071 --> 00:36:20,298
We need a typewriter.

456
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,625
SOS.

457
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:28,791
Sorry, Please guide me.

458
00:36:28,816 --> 00:36:30,967
I rent a car.

459
00:36:30,992 --> 00:36:34,074
Can you drive?

460
00:36:35,642 --> 00:36:37,228
That's good.

461
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:40,265
You're drunk so much.

462
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,538
there's no need to worry

463
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:45,035
before the war, no matter how I drunk.

464
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,230
I drove himself to the site

465
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:48,697
Doctor.

466
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:57,035
I had a surgery after drinking a lot,

467
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,390
but the next morning

468
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:03,200
I couldn't even remember how I had the surgery

469
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,490
I thought this was bad, so I woke up and rushed over to the hospital,

470
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:12,142
but the patient was given proper treatment

471
00:37:12,555 --> 00:37:16,795
Occupation is consciousness, that's what I came here for

472
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:19,538
Here it is.

473
00:37:22,546 --> 00:37:25,176
Yuko-san? What's wrong?

474
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,103
It's not Yuko-san

475
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:28,827
It's Kozukai-san.

476
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,785
Watch out.

477
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,520
Over here.

478
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:40,780
A Mitaka Station express train leaves from platform 2

479
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,546
Please hurry up

480
00:37:47,261 --> 00:37:49,441
Here it is.

481
00:37:52,528 --> 00:37:54,288
Here it is.

482
00:37:58,691 --> 00:38:01,780
I guess we'll take the train after all.

483
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,826
No, it's this way

484
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:16,165
Good evening, Keep sleeping.

485
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:25,737
It's getting so late.

486
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,900
Sorry I'm late,How's her?

487
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:40,474
You must be hungry.Have a meal.

488
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:46,175
I've made your nightgown.

489
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:51,297
Sorry, this part is still bad

490
00:38:54,204 --> 00:38:55,497
Have a meal.

491
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,786
Sorry to worry you too much.

492
00:39:08,965 --> 00:39:11,805
Don't be sad.

493
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,535
I heard from Matsuki about the details.

494
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,994
It's like a procession of disasters

495
00:39:25,353 --> 00:39:28,697
If you think too much about it, it'll just come back to haunt you

496
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:37,590
I walked in the dark, stepped in the mud, and got my best kimono a little dirty

497
00:39:42,473 --> 00:39:45,521
I have to be back in Osaka?

498
00:39:45,865 --> 00:39:48,312
Don't worry, Yuko?

499
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,630
I can't go back to Osaka either. I have no where to go.

500
00:39:55,706 --> 00:39:59,360
Why you come to Tokyo...

501
00:40:01,695 --> 00:40:06,986
All personnel, please report to your assigned stations.

502
00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:17,500
According to information from the emergency headquarters,
about 300 people are aiming for official documents

503
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:19,288
Stop it.

504
00:40:20,281 --> 00:40:24,497
Enemy's current location is Muffin-san
Southern medicine, each state, you

505
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:26,921
What are you doing?

506
00:40:31,428 --> 00:40:33,661
What are you doing?

507
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,479
Hurry up.

508
00:40:37,326 --> 00:40:39,153
I’m sorry.

509
00:40:39,806 --> 00:40:43,167
Your attitude is bad.

510
00:40:52,295 --> 00:40:53,475
It's military music.

511
00:41:01,411 --> 00:41:02,891
It's military music.

512
00:41:03,811 --> 00:41:04,704
Break up.

513
00:41:08,668 --> 00:41:10,128
Come in.

514
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:21,610
Good night aunty.

515
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:31,347
I'm home.

516
00:41:33,573 --> 00:41:35,059
Keirin,again?

517
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:37,073
Omachi.

518
00:41:38,387 --> 00:41:39,767
It is so profitable.

519
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,746
That's why you're asking me to lend you some capital.

520
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:49,504
You are Take-san from Tadonya

521
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,247
why you don't make Tadon?

522
00:41:55,326 --> 00:41:57,422
tadon shops make tadon..

523
00:41:57,447 --> 00:41:59,409
I know.

524
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:02,658
You're in bad mood.

525
00:42:04,131 --> 00:42:08,485
I decided to write a letter tonight.

526
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:09,745
Who is this for?

527
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:11,630
For Kakichi.

528
00:42:13,136 --> 00:42:14,416
It's over now

529
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,032
It's all over

530
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:23,219
There's no need to deal with someone like that, he is idiot

531
00:42:24,346 --> 00:42:27,009
It's okay to go to bed now

532
00:42:27,034 --> 00:42:28,322
I don't need.

533
00:42:28,728 --> 00:42:29,808
OK OK.

534
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,773
I don't need.

535
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:35,026
It's your fault because you are sloppy.

536
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:36,033
What's the big deal?

537
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,270
When our dad died, you didn't have any money

538
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:44,779
so you couldn't give him a funeral

539
00:42:46,035 --> 00:42:47,615
That's terrible.

540
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,529
There's nothing more embarrassing than this

541
00:42:51,043 --> 00:42:56,237
So I close my eyes, close my eyes

542
00:42:57,771 --> 00:43:02,378
Omachi, are you ok?

543
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:10,987
That's why I get dizzy sometimes.

544
00:43:11,038 --> 00:43:14,291
Dizziness? Pull yourself together

545
00:43:14,956 --> 00:43:17,566
If you're not feeling well, you need to see a doctor

546
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,196
Who earn the money?

547
00:43:21,629 --> 00:43:23,635
So I'll lend you money.

548
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:25,970
You're good bros.

549
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:32,208
Good evening, thank you for the rear cart

550
00:43:35,098 --> 00:43:36,945
Are you fighting?

551
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,556
You're just a kid and you
say unnecessary things.

552
00:44:00,443 --> 00:44:01,348
Shun-chan?

553
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,519
There is soba noodles there. Eat it

554
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:16,095
Shun is back.

555
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:17,350
Good night.

556
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,162
The next day, the Mikumo Hospital will be busy as usual.

557
00:44:47,675 --> 00:44:48,688
Excuse me.

558
00:44:52,016 --> 00:44:54,049
I'm in hurry.

559
00:44:54,074 --> 00:44:55,985
Are you here for a examine?

560
00:44:56,065 --> 00:44:56,879
I need a (surgical) operation

561
00:44:57,132 --> 00:44:57,972
(surgical) operation?

562
00:44:59,642 --> 00:45:01,002
What's wrong?

563
00:45:01,182 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm fine

564
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,625
So what kind of surgery is this?

565
00:45:09,668 --> 00:45:11,585
I want you to remove this tattoo.

566
00:45:13,305 --> 00:45:14,778
That's woman's name.

567
00:45:15,709 --> 00:45:17,515
She's older than I.

568
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:23,435
I was threatened and got a tattoo. I have to go home, but I can't go home because of this tattoo

569
00:45:23,543 --> 00:45:25,796
My father scolds me. My father is strict

570
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,940
I was threatened and got a tattoo

571
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:32,064
Wait a minute

572
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,641
Doctor, There's a patient.

573
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:38,315
An emergency?

574
00:45:38,728 --> 00:45:41,642
He's a student.
He need to have his tattoo removed.

575
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:43,229
He's idiot.

576
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,817
He's still student.

577
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:48,838
Apparently, he was threatened by an older woman.

578
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,490
He's becoming more and more stupid

579
00:45:50,523 --> 00:45:52,170
Would you decline?

580
00:45:52,195 --> 00:45:56,769
I'll remove it out. Maybe he's trying to get out of this stupid life

581
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,354
Good morning.

582
00:45:59,378 --> 00:46:00,334
Good morning

583
00:46:00,854 --> 00:46:02,345
I'll be doing the tattoo surgery,

584
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:04,110
so please take it easy today

585
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:07,970
You'll make up for the last night?, yesterday I was so tired

586
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,957
as soon as you left, I visited there.

587
00:46:09,995 --> 00:46:12,961
Sorry to hear that.

588
00:46:13,876 --> 00:46:20,891
I went to the site late at night, but what was that all about?

589
00:46:21,163 --> 00:46:23,706
The baby was too big, right?

590
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,566
Yes but...

591
00:46:26,009 --> 00:46:28,442
but I wonder what kind of treatment I did..

592
00:46:31,796 --> 00:46:32,776
Damn it.

593
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:36,786
Hey.

594
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:38,643
Taki?

595
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:48,100
Hurry up.
Baby is big. please prepare the stuff.

596
00:46:49,783 --> 00:46:51,056
You are here.

597
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:44,484
Kaozukai?

598
00:47:45,022 --> 00:47:45,882
Hello.

599
00:47:46,353 --> 00:47:49,752
I was just thinking of picking you up from here

600
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,293
Is the sick person serious?

601
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,197
I'm talking about the (surgical) operation fee

602
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:58,675
our salary is due at the very end of the month

603
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:00,229
Don't worry about the fee.

604
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:01,765
How's the sick person?

605
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:05,863
I really don't know..

606
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:10,485
Where is the woman of childbirth?

607
00:48:44,703 --> 00:48:45,832
I'm glad

608
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,367
I'm glad

609
00:48:53,437 --> 00:48:56,771
Oh, Kozukai-san, Give me water.

610
00:48:58,053 --> 00:49:00,613
Sorry about the fee.

611
00:49:00,899 --> 00:49:04,015
I need water.

612
00:49:10,049 --> 00:49:13,970
On the way back, I took a detour and went out to the bank

613
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,167
I thought I'd visit him.

614
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:22,505
Stupid.

615
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:27,591
It's not good to move the ship for her.

616
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:33,038
The boatman was probably worried about the bills and gambling.

617
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:43,095
The Doctor!

618
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:46,843
How's Yuko?

619
00:49:46,916 --> 00:49:47,911
Is she feeling better?

620
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:52,362
she came to the office with Shunzo this morning

621
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:57,844
But Doctor, I feel sorry about her.

622
00:49:58,532 --> 00:50:00,632
You know a lot of women.

623
00:50:00,663 --> 00:50:04,273
If you have a good woman, please introduce us.

624
00:50:05,063 --> 00:50:08,881
Ok I get it

625
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:10,644
Please…

626
00:50:11,603 --> 00:50:13,683
Are you going home?

627
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,406
I'm going to see another one.

628
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,180
Up ahead is a mansion called Minoshima

629
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:25,610
and they refer to this visit as sankin-kotai (alternate attendance)

630
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:30,490
That was for the housewife of this mansion, who is over forty years old

631
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:39,551
This is because once a month, doctors are forced to imitate historical events that are almost meaningless for the sake of maintaining beauty.

632
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,298
why did you listen to Minoshima ?

633
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:53,448
He has nothing, don't deal with him.

634
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:55,000
Omachi, I'm heading to Minoshima now.

635
00:50:55,024 --> 00:50:57,447
I can't stop feeling sick from the river

636
00:50:58,545 --> 00:50:59,292
For what?

637
00:50:59,766 --> 00:51:02,549
I'm upset.
I'll hit him.

638
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,099
Don't do that.

639
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:05,536
It's none of your business.

640
00:51:06,416 --> 00:51:07,036
Omachi.

641
00:51:10,548 --> 00:51:13,039
 isn't it Miyajima's fault?

642
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:15,335
You are sick these days.

643
00:51:18,282 --> 00:51:19,488
Leave it to me.

644
00:51:27,432 --> 00:51:32,597
Madam, Madam, do you know a man called Kakichi?

645
00:51:34,604 --> 00:51:35,904
I don't know a man like that

646
00:51:36,065 --> 00:51:39,995
He came here to see Minojima.

647
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,347
He is out too,

648
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:43,344
He says his wife is okay with it

649
00:51:45,264 --> 00:51:46,731
 but she's sick

650
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:49,060
When I told him, he got angry.

651
00:51:49,085 --> 00:51:49,941
he'd gone home?

652
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:50,301
No.

653
00:51:50,579 --> 00:51:53,018
You're an idiot.

654
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:58,069
I'm busy today. See?

655
00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:04,015
ma'am, Dr. Mikumo has come

656
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:11,141
Oh, Dr. Mikumo, I've been waiting for you.

657
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:12,900
Please come in.

658
00:52:14,438 --> 00:52:17,046
Have a seat.

659
00:52:18,711 --> 00:52:20,653
You are absolutely great.

660
00:52:21,061 --> 00:52:25,485
I always look younger than Yamada-san's wife

661
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,380
But She's older than 4 years.

662
00:52:29,627 --> 00:52:31,740
Yamada's wife is the same age as me

663
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:35,110
I mean, Yamada's wife is about 6..

664
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:38,330
Yamada's wife lied about her age by 4 years?

665
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:41,789
That means I've lost one cutting

666
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:43,902
What a shame.

667
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:44,722
What's wrong?

668
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:46,511
That man is here.

669
00:52:46,716 --> 00:52:49,689
You are noisy. I know, I'm going

670
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,109
Please wait a moment, sir.

671
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:00,805
It's okay

672
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:04,364
I'm the wife of Minoshima.

673
00:53:06,188 --> 00:53:08,421
I came to get compensation.

674
00:53:08,921 --> 00:53:09,908
Why?

675
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,763
What do you mean?

676
00:53:12,181 --> 00:53:13,776
settlement for Omachi.

677
00:53:14,195 --> 00:53:17,607
Your must know what Minoshima did to Omachi.

678
00:53:19,503 --> 00:53:20,596
I know.

679
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,933
At that time, I scold him.

680
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,275
Even though he had a wife.

681
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,623
But he played around.

682
00:53:28,835 --> 00:53:30,385
It doesn't matter .

683
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:34,303
I mean settlement for Omachi.

684
00:53:34,825 --> 00:53:38,332
What's your name?

685
00:53:41,261 --> 00:53:42,658
I'm  Kakichi.

686
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:47,870
I don't know what kind of person you are, but

687
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:50,491
What do you mean by settlement?

688
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,625
I didn't think Minoshima did something bad to her.

689
00:53:53,675 --> 00:53:54,628
He paid her.

690
00:53:54,761 --> 00:53:55,334
Shut up!

691
00:53:57,259 --> 00:53:58,727
Don't say ridiculous things

692
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,950
He cheated her for very little money

693
00:54:02,523 --> 00:54:04,214
He used her weakness.

694
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:05,234
Kakichi.

695
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,139
please don't speak too loudly

696
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:13,249
calm down.

697
00:54:18,864 --> 00:54:20,276
Be quiet.

698
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:21,650
Ok?

699
00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:23,890
You don't have to join us.

700
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,520
Eh, don't be violent

701
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,334
Ok?

702
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:31,386
Oh.

703
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,049
Don't violent.

704
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:38,100
Is it dangerous to bring up such a knife?

705
00:54:38,474 --> 00:54:42,035
Please be quiet

706
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,660
I won't accept it if you suddenly jump out.

707
00:54:47,319 --> 00:54:49,026
You're noisy.

708
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:54,900
What are you guys doing?

709
00:55:00,143 --> 00:55:04,570
Feel free to tell me how much you want?

710
00:55:05,241 --> 00:55:06,957
50,000 to 100,000?

711
00:55:10,017 --> 00:55:11,037
150000?

712
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:14,768
Hey.

713
00:55:16,027 --> 00:55:19,420
 poor thing, it's all gone

714
00:55:25,816 --> 00:55:27,003
Are you leaving?

715
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,725
that's smarter. It's still boring if you get hurt.

716
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,330
The customer is leaving.

717
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,690
Get back.

718
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,321
Say hello to Omachi-san

719
00:55:41,047 --> 00:55:42,053
Doctor.

720
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,597
He's an idiot.

721
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,514
He's  fool but Miyajima did something bad.

722
00:55:51,967 --> 00:55:54,107
He's so bad.

723
00:56:01,924 --> 00:56:05,565
Good luck.

724
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,401
thank you very much.

725
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,749
Omachi-san, are you just overworked?

726
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,810
She collapsed at the store?

727
00:56:27,810 --> 00:56:29,654
When I came home from work,

728
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:32,567
She felt dizzy and had to run to the side of the road

729
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:36,190
I was so surprised that I immediately called my Doctor

730
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:39,526
Is it better for sick people to cool their heads with ice?

731
00:56:39,971 --> 00:56:41,325
Listen.

732
00:56:43,265 --> 00:56:45,468
She needs to have surgery right away.

733
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,255
What surgery?

734
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:50,430
The baby in her belly is dead

735
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:52,655
She has baby.

736
00:56:53,363 --> 00:56:58,391
So the rumors about Minojima were true.

737
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,530
The sooner the surgery the better

738
00:57:02,530 --> 00:57:05,391
Patient is worried about surgery and hospital fees

739
00:57:06,075 --> 00:57:09,155
Please tell him and take her to the hospital right away

740
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:11,611
They can pay me later.

741
00:57:11,807 --> 00:57:14,632
Thanks very much.

742
00:57:15,608 --> 00:57:19,605
I told him to bring her over right away

743
00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:21,072
Please.

744
00:57:21,251 --> 00:57:23,601
Thanks very much.

745
00:57:26,702 --> 00:57:31,024
You will be hospitalized and undergo surgery

746
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:34,680
You don't have to worry about money

747
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:36,788
The Doctor said so too

748
00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:39,847
All you have to do is get stronger, earn some money, and pay him.

749
00:57:40,590 --> 00:57:42,070
I don't mean to sound arrogant

750
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:46,557
He's been waiting me  for 18 years.

751
00:57:46,932 --> 00:57:47,825
But.

752
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:51,788
I'm the one who's worse off than poor

753
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:55,238
You should listen to me.

754
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:14,421
What are you doing?

755
00:58:14,915 --> 00:58:16,878
Where did you go?

756
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:20,467
Now I've made some money myself,

757
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,997
so you went to play pachinko again

758
00:58:22,795 --> 00:58:24,675
Omachi is going to be hospitalized

759
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,560
She'a going to have surgery

760
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,610
Surgery?

761
00:58:27,844 --> 00:58:28,844
Yes.

762
00:58:29,475 --> 00:58:33,052
You are lazy and always makes her a pain.

763
00:58:33,965 --> 00:58:35,565
You have a work but

764
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:36,980
but it looks like a festival lantern

765
00:58:37,005 --> 00:58:42,667
You always hang around.
You are scam of men.

766
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:48,660
I thinks so too

767
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:56,090
What? are you even going to let me have you fool me?
Get out.

768
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,265
Give it back to me.

769
00:59:06,179 --> 00:59:08,692
Visit her.

770
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:10,663
Yes.

771
00:59:12,098 --> 00:59:14,211
Are you alright?

772
00:59:22,686 --> 00:59:23,966
She's sick.

773
00:59:30,235 --> 00:59:31,301
Are you alright?

774
00:59:32,208 --> 00:59:33,428
Get well.

775
00:59:34,871 --> 00:59:36,800
Stop it, Yusaku-san

776
00:59:42,426 --> 00:59:46,221
It has been rainy days since Omachi was hospitalized

777
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,454
Do you visit her?

778
01:00:11,567 --> 01:00:14,504
How's her?

779
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:16,760
She's going well. I got the stitches out last night

780
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,023
Thanks.

781
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:20,503
By the way, about the (surgical) operation fee..

782
01:00:20,973 --> 01:00:23,225
There's something happened.

783
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:25,760
the kid has the mumps

784
01:00:25,785 --> 01:00:26,885
So please wait.

785
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:27,755
Don't worry.

786
01:00:28,468 --> 01:00:30,390
It it big bag.

787
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:36,013
Look, these are her clothes.
See you.

788
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:40,685
Sorry to disturb you.

789
01:00:44,192 --> 01:00:46,482
Doctor,he is annoying.

790
01:00:47,206 --> 01:00:48,720
He's crazy.

791
01:00:48,801 --> 01:00:49,667
What?

792
01:00:49,692 --> 01:00:52,444
every time he see a woman's face, he always talks dirty.

793
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,158
People with same room are also having trouble.

794
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:56,087
That's bad.
He's crazy.

795
01:00:56,879 --> 01:01:01,597
I want to hear some old love stories to kill time

796
01:01:01,815 --> 01:01:03,905
I wanna hear.

797
01:01:03,961 --> 01:01:06,308
That's rubbish.

798
01:01:06,973 --> 01:01:11,557
You look like You'd done something like that

799
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,467
That's not true, that's ridiculous,

800
01:01:16,298 --> 01:01:17,238
it's not enough

801
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:22,374
how old is you?

802
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:24,895
What are you asking my age?

803
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,637
You look nice

804
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:28,922
it would be a waste

805
01:01:29,438 --> 01:01:31,212
It's none of your business.

806
01:01:31,889 --> 01:01:33,253
No, that's not true

807
01:01:33,906 --> 01:01:38,261
I like women who have experience like yours.

808
01:01:52,764 --> 01:01:53,868
What are you doing?

809
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,784
It's great that you're doing well, but this is a hospital

810
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,263
And be mindful of your roommates.

811
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:04,277
I get it.

812
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:08,156
I'll definitely pay for the surgery

813
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:09,790
Of course you'd have to pay

814
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,660
This is not a charity hospital

815
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,934
I get it.

816
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,275
Anytime is fine.

817
01:02:18,167 --> 01:02:21,445
Lieutenant General Okazaki is here.

818
01:02:21,902 --> 01:02:22,815
Again?

819
01:02:25,201 --> 01:02:26,034
military doctor

820
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,682
Lieutenant General Okazaki is here.

821
01:02:31,959 --> 01:02:33,894
Thanks for your hard work.

822
01:02:34,378 --> 01:02:36,045
We have wounded soldiers.

823
01:02:36,266 --> 01:02:38,079
You have wounded soldiers?

824
01:02:38,865 --> 01:02:40,410
Is someone injured?

825
01:02:41,828 --> 01:02:42,721
It's an airman

826
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:45,817
It's an airman?

827
01:02:46,765 --> 01:02:51,919
Please come right away.
He's in pain.

828
01:02:55,532 --> 01:02:56,439
Hurry up.

829
01:02:56,517 --> 01:02:57,847
Where are you going?

830
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:00,569
Where is he?

831
01:03:00,729 --> 01:03:02,102
He's at my base.

832
01:03:09,031 --> 01:03:10,579
This is it.

833
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:13,250
Is he injured?

834
01:03:14,073 --> 01:03:15,213
He's back.

835
01:03:15,670 --> 01:03:21,487
I see, He is airman, a child, a boy airman.

836
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,220
He was shot with a gun.

837
01:03:24,407 --> 01:03:26,227
He's got injured.

838
01:03:26,607 --> 01:03:27,221
Is he going to get better?

839
01:03:27,246 --> 01:03:29,305
It won't serious much

840
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:37,372
Stay down.

841
01:03:38,012 --> 01:03:40,291
you're an Imperial soldier, aren't you?

842
01:03:46,005 --> 01:03:48,559
 What are you doing, Doctor?

843
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:50,585
It's duck?

844
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:53,976
This is an eagle.

845
01:03:54,142 --> 01:03:55,469
You've had a hard time

846
01:03:55,590 --> 01:03:57,117
Take good care of him.

847
01:03:57,802 --> 01:03:59,546
Did you finish your work?

848
01:03:59,799 --> 01:04:00,946
I'm off today.

849
01:04:01,543 --> 01:04:04,631
I heard that Yuko were able to get a job.

850
01:04:04,656 --> 01:04:06,891
Doctor, Yuko really is a talented person.

851
01:04:07,255 --> 01:04:09,095
She was immediate employed.

852
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,120
So you go together every day

853
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:14,440
Yuko is making our lunch now

854
01:04:14,440 --> 01:04:16,050
She'll deliver it to her mother in the hospital

855
01:04:16,050 --> 01:04:19,190
Then, on the way back, you two should go to see a movie.

856
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,620
But Yuko said she does not want to go see a movie. She wants to take some commemorative photos

857
01:04:22,645 --> 01:04:23,875
What's that?

858
01:04:24,593 --> 01:04:26,315
It's a commemorative photo of a new start.

859
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,870
But Doctor, that's so realistic and serious

860
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,739
That's weird.

861
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:36,258
I was a romantic when I was young like you

862
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,090
I wanted to be in the photo with some girl.

863
01:04:41,535 --> 01:04:47,425
So, Yuko is a romantic and masculine?

864
01:04:47,450 --> 01:04:49,228
She's feminine and classic.

865
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:52,905
Get ready to cook.

866
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:54,810
Is he your patient?

867
01:04:54,942 --> 01:04:56,428
What are you doing?

868
01:04:57,032 --> 01:04:58,270
What did he eat?

869
01:04:58,270 --> 01:04:59,960
Go to buy it.

870
01:05:04,755 --> 01:05:05,943
Is your lunch ready?

871
01:05:07,681 --> 01:05:09,457
I asked Shunzo to go out and run an errand,

872
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:11,740
so I'll deliver it

873
01:05:16,815 --> 01:05:18,395
Are you feeling better now?

874
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,006
Isn't your job hard?

875
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:23,976
Shunzo-san is very kind to me.

876
01:05:24,094 --> 01:05:25,108
so that's fine

877
01:05:25,415 --> 01:05:30,145
Some people become pessimistic and angry when disaster happened.

878
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,120
but they are the ones lacking courage

879
01:05:32,120 --> 01:05:33,804
They are so timid,

880
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,688
Doctor. How's Omachi?

881
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,370
Don't worry

882
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:42,290
She'll be able to leave the hospital in about a week,

883
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:44,224
so I'll get it when you can

884
01:05:50,127 --> 01:05:51,440
Where's doctor?

885
01:05:52,835 --> 01:05:54,875
can you reply me at least ?

886
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:55,865
Where's doctor?

887
01:05:56,097 --> 01:05:57,617
He's having a bath.

888
01:05:57,694 --> 01:06:00,033
A bath?

889
01:06:01,847 --> 01:06:02,940
Baya?

890
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:06,403
It's not hot enough.

891
01:06:07,058 --> 01:06:08,664
Really?

892
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:41,836
Hurry up.

893
01:06:54,006 --> 01:06:54,871
It looks delicious.

894
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,580
I looked it earlier.

895
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,882
Its sesame sprinkles are very tasty!

896
01:07:02,182 --> 01:07:06,114
It is so well seasoned and delicious!

897
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:08,645
Have some.

898
01:07:10,772 --> 01:07:13,777
Yuko is very good cook.

899
01:07:14,933 --> 01:07:19,614
But there are a few things that I worry.

900
01:07:20,179 --> 01:07:21,712
What?

901
01:07:22,070 --> 01:07:24,903
Yuko is just an ordinary girl

902
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,061
Women who are good at cooking are troublesome.

903
01:07:29,971 --> 01:07:31,927
That's the first time I've heard of such a word.

904
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:35,933
But is there anything like that happening to Yuko?

905
01:07:36,546 --> 01:07:39,179
No way.

906
01:07:40,067 --> 01:07:46,695
Since Yuko-san came to my house, My son has stopped writing letters to people.

907
01:07:47,820 --> 01:07:53,838
I am worried that He may start to heat up.

908
01:07:54,730 --> 01:07:56,996
In fact, that's a good thing, isn't it?

909
01:07:58,633 --> 01:08:01,804
It's not so bad to have an older wife

910
01:08:03,645 --> 01:08:06,355
Do you mean that they have to get married?

911
01:08:06,380 --> 01:08:08,566
In fact, that's a good thing, isn't it?

912
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:12,232
But Yuko is....

913
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,674
What's wrong?

914
01:08:24,348 --> 01:08:25,733
 I'll go make some tea

915
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:30,473
Are you trying to claim her what happened the other day?

916
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:33,776
It's not her fault.

917
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:37,764
That kind of thing won't change Yuko's worth.

918
01:08:38,550 --> 01:08:40,322
But ..

919
01:08:44,073 --> 01:08:46,973
you don't want her to be the wife of your son?

920
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:03,559
Didn't you feel sorry for her?

921
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:07,004
You told me to find a wife for your son.

922
01:09:07,445 --> 01:09:10,841
That is certainly true, but...

923
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:11,968
What's wrong?

924
01:09:13,229 --> 01:09:14,875
I don't care

925
01:09:15,956 --> 01:09:22,196
But.... Yuko Apparently his father lives in Osaka

926
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:23,492
Maybe her dad is against it

927
01:09:23,517 --> 01:09:27,958
Not at all. I'm sure her dad would be happy to hear about it

928
01:09:28,975 --> 01:09:30,575
You think so?

929
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:39,219
This is really a problem,
Have some.

930
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,250
Are you not going to eat anymore?

931
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:41,955
Well then

932
01:09:47,103 --> 01:09:48,210
I'm sorry

933
01:09:53,628 --> 01:09:54,525
Omachi.

934
01:10:00,241 --> 01:10:02,468
Doctor,Omachi is here.

935
01:10:03,003 --> 01:10:04,684
What's wrong?

936
01:10:04,709 --> 01:10:06,950
Patient with appendicitis is missing.

937
01:10:07,548 --> 01:10:09,719
Don't move.

938
01:10:09,899 --> 01:10:11,946
Patient with appendicitis is missing.

939
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:18,641
Oh my god.

940
01:10:19,958 --> 01:10:20,738
Are you alright?

941
01:10:20,763 --> 01:10:21,605
I'm alright.

942
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:25,463
Gosuke!

943
01:10:26,217 --> 01:10:27,437
Gosuke!

944
01:10:28,216 --> 01:10:30,043
Are you alright?

945
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:32,120
Stay strong.

946
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:39,167
what happened?

947
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:41,248
An appendectomy patient escaped.

948
01:10:41,376 --> 01:10:42,250
Run away?

949
01:10:42,288 --> 01:10:44,468
I thought she was strange.

950
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:49,410
So she brought something like this

951
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,990
Apparently she ran away with rear car.

952
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,276
I was careless.

953
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:56,530
No.

954
01:10:56,606 --> 01:10:58,579
It's my fault.

955
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:01,514
I was the same room.

956
01:11:01,539 --> 01:11:06,034
Don't think too much.
It's Shunzo's fault.

957
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,879
It was no good leaving it there.

958
01:11:09,505 --> 01:11:11,005
Even so,

959
01:11:11,030 --> 01:11:15,618
She suddenly disappear...

960
01:11:16,937 --> 01:11:20,034
No,  I'll have to pay for it at the hospital.

961
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:21,085
I'm in trouble.

962
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,810
I can't even pay for hospital or surgery fees.

963
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,660
If you did that, I wouldn't be able to stay here.

964
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,000
That's not good

965
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,820
Then we'll both be responsible for the rear car and have the
hospitalization fee deducted from the rest of the money,

966
01:11:36,845 --> 01:11:39,160
so you can stay in the hospital without worry

967
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,176
But I'm not being that selfish.

968
01:11:43,290 --> 01:11:47,387
Please prepared a injection.

969
01:11:48,176 --> 01:11:51,436
You'll just have to be patient for another week, so you are going to bed quietly

970
01:11:51,519 --> 01:11:53,119
Promise me.

971
01:11:54,491 --> 01:11:56,124
I'm sorry,

972
01:11:57,471 --> 01:11:58,409
I'm glad

973
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:14,759
22 and 23...

974
01:12:24,628 --> 01:12:25,355
What happened?

975
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:28,001
Was the thief caught?

976
01:12:28,753 --> 01:12:31,590
It's no good, as expected he was missing.
The address is unknown.

977
01:12:31,590 --> 01:12:37,430
You see someone who is poor and you immediately have sympathy for them.

978
01:12:37,430 --> 01:12:42,100
However, while the wealthy can go to any hospital on their own,

979
01:12:42,100 --> 01:12:44,200
the poor cannot do that

980
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:51,756
It may seem simple, but It can't be helped.

981
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:54,998
Have a drink?

982
01:12:58,999 --> 01:13:00,219
Come on.

983
01:13:04,244 --> 01:13:06,118
it's boring to be doctor.

984
01:13:07,226 --> 01:13:08,859
You think so?

985
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:11,267
Doctors are so busy worrying about the hospital from morning to night

986
01:13:11,446 --> 01:13:13,498
that they don't have time to think about themselves

987
01:13:13,939 --> 01:13:15,810
Their life and  happiness,

988
01:13:15,922 --> 01:13:22,938
I thought about that there was a better business.

989
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:25,940
I thought there was a better life.

990
01:13:25,940 --> 01:13:26,770
So what happened?

991
01:13:27,595 --> 01:13:33,943
I won't do anything about it then. I got a wife. It's a dream that everyone has in their youth

992
01:13:34,430 --> 01:13:36,668
when you get a wife and forget about it.

993
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:38,245
You think so?

994
01:13:44,317 --> 01:13:46,452
Why don't you get a wife?

995
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:49,356
I agree.

996
01:13:49,909 --> 01:13:51,382
Who are you talking about?

997
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:56,460
Don't hide it, I know, Taki.

998
01:13:59,253 --> 01:13:59,926
Yes.

999
01:14:00,913 --> 01:14:01,840
Uncle.

1000
01:14:04,416 --> 01:14:05,976
Are you calling me?

1001
01:14:06,116 --> 01:14:07,645
Are you asleep already?

1002
01:14:07,670 --> 01:14:08,026
Yes,

1003
01:14:08,759 --> 01:14:12,722
what happened to the patient in second floor?

1004
01:14:13,531 --> 01:14:15,017
Her body temperature was 38.5.

1005
01:14:15,157 --> 01:14:16,344
It's still high.

1006
01:14:16,663 --> 01:14:25,554
Rest her for a while, so be careful.
You go to bed too.

1007
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:31,961
It's ringing again. Please answer.

1008
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:42,900
It's Mikumo Hospital, a grocery store in front of the station? Are you giving birth?

1009
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:49,185
That Doctor is now sleeping.

1010
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,950
tomorrow morning ok?

1011
01:14:52,950 --> 01:14:55,996
Yes, I understand. take care.

1012
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:02,848
She gives birth a lot.

1013
01:15:03,209 --> 01:15:05,334
This will be 8th baby.

1014
01:15:05,448 --> 01:15:07,468
There's many case like that these days.

1015
01:15:08,342 --> 01:15:11,552
People don't have the ability to properly raise babies.

1016
01:15:12,526 --> 01:15:13,439
That's bad.

1017
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:18,340
Rather than giving birth, they should think about whether they can raise a child happily

1018
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:21,032
That is true parental love

1019
01:15:23,419 --> 01:15:24,269
Let's go to sleep.

1020
01:15:25,606 --> 01:15:30,785
Anyway, since they were born, everyone should be happy

1021
01:15:31,610 --> 01:15:35,643
Even their parent, a child, a man, or anything like that.

1022
01:15:43,419 --> 01:15:46,352
I can't make my baby happy.

1023
01:15:47,786 --> 01:15:49,186
That's not true

1024
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:54,392
No matter what happens, as long as you have a good feeling, you are entitled to happiness.

1025
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:58,237
That's right, that wasn't the case, Women are miserable

1026
01:15:58,941 --> 01:16:00,456
Stay strong.

1027
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:05,779
Let's get stronger, be happy, and give the nuts back.

1028
01:16:08,290 --> 01:16:11,540
We had the same disaster

1029
01:16:14,255 --> 01:16:16,285
Let's be happy.

1030
01:16:18,459 --> 01:16:19,150
Who?

1031
01:16:38,838 --> 01:16:40,240
I thought I should have come sooner.

1032
01:16:41,590 --> 01:16:45,456
I just couldn't come up with the money

1033
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:49,941
You need money for the hospital.

1034
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:51,468
Leave it to me

1035
01:16:52,860 --> 01:16:54,910
I made mistake at Minoshima's house.

1036
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,576
I have other ideas. Please wait.

1037
01:16:57,801 --> 01:16:58,577
Don't worry.

1038
01:16:58,892 --> 01:17:01,353
Hospital charges were secured by a rear car.

1039
01:17:01,892 --> 01:17:02,656
rear car?

1040
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:06,731
So you don't need to worry about that anymore

1041
01:17:07,883 --> 01:17:11,705
My illness was Minojima fault, as you say

1042
01:17:12,510 --> 01:17:15,512
I'm glad about what you say.

1043
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:17,860
Omachi.

1044
01:17:19,484 --> 01:17:21,700
Let's go to the countryside when you get better.

1045
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:26,073
I'm thinking of getting out of the Yakuza business

1046
01:17:28,660 --> 01:17:32,970
My Yakuza boss really wants me to cut off my finger.

1047
01:17:34,333 --> 01:17:36,011
I don't mind if I lose one finger.

1048
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,361
But the doctor told me.

1049
01:17:40,136 --> 01:17:43,826
My mother's wrinkled face flashes before my eyes

1050
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:46,579
I wanted to go back to the country

1051
01:17:47,650 --> 01:17:51,275
My mom is doing business by herself, so I'll help her

1052
01:17:52,679 --> 01:17:54,286
Please take me.

1053
01:17:56,578 --> 01:17:58,998
I don't do gambling and the blackmail anymore.

1054
01:18:10,390 --> 01:18:12,260
Today is my day off.

1055
01:18:38,926 --> 01:18:42,579
Yusaku was allowed to participate as a carrier.

1056
01:18:47,304 --> 01:18:49,024
Hurry up.

1057
01:18:55,826 --> 01:18:58,365
Let's fish here.

1058
01:19:00,207 --> 01:19:03,229
Take care of it gently.

1059
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:16,028
My tegusu is missing.

1060
01:19:18,169 --> 01:19:19,931
Where's my tegusu?

1061
01:19:21,822 --> 01:19:25,295
I forgot to bring Tegusu.

1062
01:19:25,536 --> 01:19:26,358
Where did you leave it?

1063
01:19:26,383 --> 01:19:27,132
I have no idea.

1064
01:19:27,516 --> 01:19:29,016
If you know, I'll get it.

1065
01:19:32,295 --> 01:19:33,562
I left it next to the phone.

1066
01:19:34,296 --> 01:19:35,042
next to the phone?

1067
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:37,734
There was call this morning.

1068
01:19:38,635 --> 01:19:42,800
I was on the phone and left it there

1069
01:19:42,876 --> 01:19:44,638
It is at the phone definitely.

1070
01:19:51,628 --> 01:19:52,636
Are you alright?

1071
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:57,394
I think it's best to think of it as a hike.

1072
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:04,667
Yes, that seems more romantic to you guys

1073
01:20:08,618 --> 01:20:09,929
Let's go.

1074
01:20:10,662 --> 01:20:11,635
Let's go.

1075
01:20:12,581 --> 01:20:13,314
No.

1076
01:20:13,821 --> 01:20:14,900
Let's go.

1077
01:20:20,395 --> 01:20:23,868
Doctor, Yuko is romantic and nice.

1078
01:20:25,192 --> 01:20:27,964
Women are very moody.

1079
01:20:28,340 --> 01:20:30,109
She's feminine and classic.

1080
01:20:30,237 --> 01:20:31,564
Yuzo!

1081
01:20:35,590 --> 01:20:37,096
Here we go

1082
01:20:51,753 --> 01:20:52,924
They make fun of me.

1083
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:54,233
Lieutenant Okazaki

1084
01:20:57,210 --> 01:20:59,020
We took a rest.

1085
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,509
Tegus?

1086
01:21:25,569 --> 01:21:27,476
Where is it?

1087
01:21:28,031 --> 01:21:29,918
On your head.

1088
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:32,786
These are my white hairs.

1089
01:21:33,036 --> 01:21:35,609
This is Tegus.

1090
01:21:38,866 --> 01:21:40,306
This is not your white hair.

1091
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:42,826
It hurts.

1092
01:21:43,262 --> 01:21:43,968
This?

1093
01:21:44,222 --> 01:21:45,889
Don't make fun of me.

1094
01:21:47,466 --> 01:21:48,854
Don't make fun of me.

1095
01:21:52,964 --> 01:21:55,091
Wait!

1096
01:21:56,325 --> 01:21:59,126
Where's Yuko?

1097
01:22:03,684 --> 01:22:07,402
I won't let you run away. Hey, wait

1098
01:22:08,088 --> 01:22:09,370
Stop it.

1099
01:22:09,395 --> 01:22:11,544
That is my white hair.

1100
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,829
Give me.

1101
01:22:22,297 --> 01:22:24,051
Cut it out.

1102
01:22:29,787 --> 01:22:30,477
It hurts.

1103
01:22:32,123 --> 01:22:33,473
This is Tegusu.

1104
01:22:59,976 --> 01:23:01,666
I'm sick of him.

1105
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:04,592
I should have brought him.

1106
01:23:10,324 --> 01:23:12,871
How about this?

1107
01:23:14,681 --> 01:23:17,534
I'm pretty sure I left this under the phone

1108
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:23,186
I was once again invited to a strange party.

1109
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:29,846
Yes, yes, the chief of the police station?

1110
01:23:31,445 --> 01:23:35,905
Hisao? Ok I get it.

1111
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:03,878
Is there a reason for this?

1112
01:24:04,037 --> 01:24:05,346
No at all

1113
01:24:06,046 --> 01:24:08,886
As a police officer, I would like to ask you a favor.

1114
01:24:08,950 --> 01:24:11,217
So have a drink.

1115
01:24:12,126 --> 01:24:13,324
Thanks.

1116
01:24:29,797 --> 01:24:31,191
President

1117
01:24:32,478 --> 01:24:34,605
Well then, excuse me for a moment,

1118
01:24:39,995 --> 01:24:42,455
Ready?

1119
01:24:44,180 --> 01:24:48,397
Come on, wanna play?

1120
01:24:48,999 --> 01:24:51,536
Make your bid.

1121
01:24:53,231 --> 01:24:55,459
I liked it.

1122
01:24:58,090 --> 01:24:59,304
What's wrong?

1123
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:02,572
Keep going.

1124
01:25:13,418 --> 01:25:15,292
Excuse me for a moment

1125
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,439
Let's prepare for a party.
Let's have fun.

1126
01:25:20,955 --> 01:25:24,925
Sake is more important than words

1127
01:25:25,026 --> 01:25:26,626
Music start!

1128
01:25:49,676 --> 01:25:52,149
What's the hell?

1129
01:26:00,304 --> 01:26:01,791
Bid it!

1130
01:26:01,999 --> 01:26:03,726
Ok come on!

1131
01:26:16,878 --> 01:26:17,431
Hold on.

1132
01:26:29,190 --> 01:26:29,797
Hey.

1133
01:26:29,977 --> 01:26:30,837
What's wrong?

1134
01:26:31,203 --> 01:26:32,736
it's a fight again.

1135
01:26:33,087 --> 01:26:34,841
I'm tired.

1136
01:26:39,325 --> 01:26:41,318
Forgive me.

1137
01:26:50,770 --> 01:26:57,256
The police officer is trying to make the idiot let his guard down

1138
01:27:02,575 --> 01:27:09,730
You are a cart thief. Your actions are cowardly.
Stop!

1139
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,027
I returned it.

1140
01:27:15,970 --> 01:27:17,436
Hey! Get down!

1141
01:27:34,551 --> 01:27:35,644
Wait!

1142
01:27:46,389 --> 01:27:47,934
It's cold

1143
01:27:53,280 --> 01:27:55,710
You are the boatman of that ship.

1144
01:27:55,710 --> 01:27:58,073
I told you not to play gambling.

1145
01:27:58,386 --> 01:28:00,850
Your wife is sick so where have you been?

1146
01:28:01,436 --> 01:28:02,531
Sorry,

1147
01:28:02,910 --> 01:28:04,497
Oh you are Kakichi?

1148
01:28:05,649 --> 01:28:08,508
What's this situation?

1149
01:28:09,065 --> 01:28:10,995
Didn't you get over your Yakuza business?

1150
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:13,362
Weren't we supposed to go back to the country with Omachi?

1151
01:28:15,321 --> 01:28:17,105
I just wanted the hospital fee.

1152
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:17,975
hospital fee?

1153
01:28:18,723 --> 01:28:21,258
I feel sorry for him having to be hospitalized because he can't afford the hospitalization fees

1154
01:28:21,670 --> 01:28:23,310
So you made the gambling?

1155
01:28:23,335 --> 01:28:23,945
Stupid!

1156
01:28:28,091 --> 01:28:29,184
He's stupid.

1157
01:28:30,526 --> 01:28:34,455
You too should really think about what you say about.

1158
01:28:34,940 --> 01:28:36,433
You guys need to reflect on this.

1159
01:28:37,968 --> 01:28:40,385
Something has happened!

1160
01:28:42,438 --> 01:28:43,644
What happened?

1161
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:45,579
Omachi has came back home

1162
01:28:45,610 --> 01:28:47,058
Why you make her do that?

1163
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,920
sickness won't get better.

1164
01:28:48,920 --> 01:28:51,880
director of the hospital went to doctor's visit

1165
01:28:51,905 --> 01:28:56,055
Nurse is laundry ,Baya is sleeping.

1166
01:28:56,467 --> 01:28:59,034
In the meantime it happened.

1167
01:28:59,993 --> 01:29:03,852
It's your fault.
You're the one who stole the rear car.

1168
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:05,315
I gave it back.

1169
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:09,140
You don't have to do unnecessary things like that

1170
01:29:09,140 --> 01:29:10,774
Omachi might not be able to stay in the hospital.

1171
01:29:10,881 --> 01:29:12,295
The rear car is back?

1172
01:29:12,679 --> 01:29:17,295
Omachi was relieved that the amount was deducted from her hospitalization fee and the rear car.

1173
01:29:17,980 --> 01:29:20,791
She'll have to pay the hospital fees when the rear car get back.

1174
01:29:21,739 --> 01:29:26,024
He did something unnecessary and ruined her idea.

1175
01:29:26,460 --> 01:29:28,190
Excuse me, please

1176
01:29:28,190 --> 01:29:29,665
Please help her

1177
01:29:32,437 --> 01:29:33,844
Let's go.

1178
01:29:34,790 --> 01:29:38,669
Please help her

1179
01:29:40,123 --> 01:29:42,023
Please help her

1180
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:46,039
Let's go

1181
01:29:52,597 --> 01:29:53,710
military doctor

1182
01:29:55,711 --> 01:29:58,527
The airmen have left.

1183
01:29:59,849 --> 01:30:01,675
I'm busy.

1184
01:30:03,139 --> 01:30:04,965
Watch out.

1185
01:30:16,585 --> 01:30:18,039
Please come in.

1186
01:30:19,651 --> 01:30:20,285
What's wrong?

1187
01:30:20,590 --> 01:30:24,126
She has acute pneumonia.
I've given her penicillin and a coagent.

1188
01:30:24,555 --> 01:30:25,667
Her Fever is 40.

1189
01:30:26,776 --> 01:30:27,976
Why you are not in the hospital

1190
01:30:28,475 --> 01:30:30,115
You were about to cure.

1191
01:30:30,140 --> 01:30:32,372
I'm going back to my trip, but I can't stop the gold color

1192
01:30:34,870 --> 01:30:38,297
But when I think about how Omachi-san is feeling,

1193
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,480
tears come to my eyes

1194
01:30:41,480 --> 01:30:45,377
Omachi don't wanna die.

1195
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:51,109
She's poor now so...

1196
01:30:54,525 --> 01:30:57,039
Please help her life.

1197
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:05,612
I am always giving her trouble and I'm so stupid man.

1198
01:31:06,610 --> 01:31:08,979
but I still love her.

1199
01:31:14,179 --> 01:31:18,477
Doctor, look, Take-san is crying

1200
01:31:19,783 --> 01:31:26,563
Doctor, Omachi won't get better?
 I'm sorry, Doctor

1201
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:37,933
I'm sorry.

1202
01:31:40,083 --> 01:31:41,383
I promised you.

1203
01:31:41,882 --> 01:31:43,989
but it's okay, I know

1204
01:31:44,655 --> 01:31:50,120
I just wanted you to spoil me a little more like a daughter

1205
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:55,155
I've wanted that...

1206
01:31:58,890 --> 01:32:00,396
I felt sorry.

1207
01:32:02,745 --> 01:32:09,055
Omachi, you have to be strong.
You promised me.

1208
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:11,367
You have to be happier.

1209
01:32:15,466 --> 01:32:18,605
Doctor, She won't get better?

1210
01:32:25,560 --> 01:32:27,166
What do you think, Gosuke?

1211
01:32:27,191 --> 01:32:28,766
I think she'll be fine.

1212
01:32:30,070 --> 01:32:32,690
If she'll never do something stupid like tonight again

1213
01:32:32,690 --> 01:32:35,009
So Doctor, She will be okay?

1214
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:36,910
My sister will be saved?

1215
01:32:36,910 --> 01:32:39,200
Because Kakichi has asked me...

1216
01:32:39,200 --> 01:32:41,207
I can't let her die.

1217
01:32:43,972 --> 01:32:46,337
Thank you very much.

1218
01:32:56,581 --> 01:32:57,974
I see.

1219
01:33:00,216 --> 01:33:00,796
military doctor

1220
01:33:02,859 --> 01:33:04,594
The airman is finally missing

1221
01:33:05,456 --> 01:33:08,751
It's probably because his wounds have healed and he has returned

1222
01:33:09,090 --> 01:33:12,936
He's a boy airman, so I guess he went back to his parents

1223
01:33:14,458 --> 01:33:16,251
He returned...

1224
01:33:17,917 --> 01:33:21,054
Go back to your dorms quickly and have a good night's sleep.

1225
01:33:31,342 --> 01:33:32,575
She's sick.

1226
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:34,316
Please be quiet

1227
01:33:42,293 --> 01:33:43,826
Stop!

1228
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:49,980
What's going on?

1229
01:33:57,863 --> 01:33:59,776
What's going on?

1230
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:05,578
Everyone gather round. Do
you understand? Hurry up.

1231
01:34:06,725 --> 01:34:09,420
It can't be helped.
It's superior's orders.

1232
01:34:10,483 --> 01:34:12,102
Please take care of the rest.

1233
01:34:12,127 --> 01:34:13,297
Yuko-san.

1234
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:16,234
Hurry up.

1235
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:29,059
What are you doing?

1236
01:34:29,220 --> 01:34:30,900
What's the hell?

1237
01:34:31,325 --> 01:34:32,585
Baya.

1238
01:34:34,260 --> 01:34:35,340
I'll tell you guys.

1239
01:34:37,273 --> 01:34:43,790
Today, I have wisely requested this.

1240
01:34:46,476 --> 01:34:50,972
I really appreciate of that.

1241
01:34:51,511 --> 01:34:53,404
Please have it with your all heart.

1242
01:34:54,110 --> 01:34:57,198
I'm giving you.

1243
01:35:00,866 --> 01:35:02,415
Open your mouth.

1244
01:35:08,074 --> 01:35:08,914
Open your mouth.

1245
01:35:21,407 --> 01:35:22,307
lieutenant colonel

1246
01:35:23,564 --> 01:35:24,411
He's an airman.

1247
01:35:25,390 --> 01:35:27,450
They ended up going back to their home.

1248
01:35:27,450 --> 01:35:28,624
Look,

1249
01:35:31,623 --> 01:35:38,386
there's a father, a mother,
and siblings - what a happy airman.

1250
01:35:44,755 --> 01:35:50,383
So now we are going to see off the airmen.

1251
01:36:02,282 --> 01:36:04,085
You're music solider.

1252
01:37:03,897 --> 01:37:05,137
Yusaku!

1253
01:37:27,834 --> 01:37:32,667
THE END

 Chatterley Fujin wa Nihon Nimo Ita / Lady Chatterley of Japan (1953)

3
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,370
Today I also pass through the gates of marriage

4
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:52,203
There are probably several young people here

5
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:00,031
And that gate should lead to the land of happiness,

6
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,390
but due to a slight twist of fate,

7
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:10,914
There are some who live in falsehood as a couple and die in falsehood as well

8
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,773
Welcome, Miss.

9
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:50,650
We, too, were like that as a couple

10
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,562
And I am a mother who will soon marry off my daughter.

11
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:07,898
(Unfinished Girl Statue)

12
00:03:29,828 --> 00:03:30,961
Sakiko!

13
00:03:36,235 --> 00:03:38,078
What are you doing?

14
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:39,109
Get your hands off of me!

15
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:43,429
Please get that done quickly

16
00:03:44,828 --> 00:03:47,297
Don't worry.
That painting is ours.

17
00:03:49,547 --> 00:03:50,805
Please take care of the rest.

18
00:03:53,813 --> 00:03:54,492
Let's go.

19
00:04:17,352 --> 00:04:18,305
Have a seat.

20
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,610
You cut your own face, didn't you?

21
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,940
Please give me an excuse

22
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:48,555
Say something.

23
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:54,179
I don't want the other people see the painting.

24
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,859
Why?

25
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,734
You know why too, right, Mom?

26
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,890
I felt so sorry for myself in that picture.

27
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,242
I tore up such a filthy picture

28
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:09,539
why? Why do you say such things?

29
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:12,539
You really want to make me say it, don't you?

30
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:13,898
That's cruel

31
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:14,445
Sakiko.

32
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,070
Shall I say it then?

33
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,070
What did you talk about with Uncle Kazama today,

34
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,896
I heard about it

35
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,078
I completely heard about it

36
00:06:27,059 --> 00:06:29,805
This arrived while you were away.

37
00:06:30,634 --> 00:06:31,950
Please call Sakiko.

38
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,855
Yes.

39
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,875
Please sit there.

40
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:24,460
I think we need to talk before you get married.

41
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:29,266
Do you know about this?

42
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,132
These are photos from our wedding

43
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,086
Becoming a soldier's wife

44
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:41,110
was a dream for girls back then

45
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:48,562
Your father had a successful career.

46
00:07:53,380 --> 00:08:00,151
He became the battalion commander of the Kanazawa
division a few years after getting married.

47
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,245
This surprise attack was a great success today.

48
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:08,315
Also,with Mr. Shimada?

49
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:11,395
He couldn't beat me today.

50
00:08:15,253 --> 00:08:17,409
The liquor is all gone.

51
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,128
Hold on.

52
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,807
When you get even a little distance away, I can't stand.

53
00:08:22,832 --> 00:08:24,706
You're like a baby.

54
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,135
Hey, bring another sake!

55
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,425
Stay up straight

56
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,362
Turn left, and move forward.

57
00:08:40,378 --> 00:08:42,135
Stop

58
00:08:43,296 --> 00:08:44,042
What is it?

59
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,440
I thought I'd drink while looking at the flowers.

60
00:08:46,628 --> 00:08:48,089
That's funny.

61
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,651
I'm feeling good.

62
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:53,964
Should I sing a song?

63
00:08:54,097 --> 00:08:55,081
Please.

64
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,881
This is a lullaby from Kumamoto.

65
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:16,245
This is awesome.

66
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,476
You should try singing one too.

67
00:09:17,694 --> 00:09:18,171
Yes.

68
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,787
What's wrong?

69
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:11,096
Because.

70
00:10:11,568 --> 00:10:12,228
What?

71
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,861
You want to have a baby with me,right?

72
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:18,005
Oh no, I wonder if this has been noticed

73
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:19,221
You’re mean.

74
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,095
Well, don't hold back.

75
00:10:21,697 --> 00:10:22,861
just take a sip and try it.

76
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,455
May I?

77
00:10:24,517 --> 00:10:25,845
Bring it here.

78
00:10:27,267 --> 00:10:29,681
Military wives need to learn to drink.

79
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:40,283
Is that delicious?

80
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:46,158
Are you alright?

81
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:53,268
I am very happy.

82
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:57,682
Really?

83
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:02,752
Once the training begins, you won't be coming back?

84
00:11:04,088 --> 00:11:05,799
I will be back in about two or three days.

85
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,748
Emperor Taisho visited the Goto family

86
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,330
Wait.

87
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,458
Thank you very much

88
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,490
I'll give this to you.

89
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:44,513
What's this?

90
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,388
This is said to be a charm given by pregnancy.

91
00:11:48,493 --> 00:11:52,020
I'm sorry for making such an unreasonable request to you.

92
00:12:31,383 --> 00:12:35,200
From that day, a large-scale training began

93
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:04,150
While waiting for my father's surgery to finish

94
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:09,625
I have never felt that time was so long in my life

95
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:18,219
Uncle Kazuma, who was present at this major
surgery, was a military doctor at the time.

96
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,630
Sister, the surgery has progressed

97
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:32,938
How was it?

98
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,820
There's no danger to life

99
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,305
That's not good to go.

100
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,500
Why?

101
00:14:44,525 --> 00:14:47,188
Calm down, sister, please calm down

102
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:02,047
The pounding rain continued to fall as if it were stirring my heart

103
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,086
I'm sorry for getting flustered.

104
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:07,172
I didn't mean to get you so excited

105
00:15:09,044 --> 00:15:12,044
I was sorry for that.

106
00:15:13,527 --> 00:15:17,679
But isn't it true that you can't feel at ease until you see it with your own eyes?

107
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:21,282
That's understandable.

108
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:26,024
but in my brother's case, he recovers in a way that doesn't interfere with his military duties

109
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:30,148
It's better not to meet him now.

110
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:35,675
Why is that? Please tell me,

111
00:15:36,031 --> 00:15:38,172
I promise I won't make a fuss anymore.

112
00:15:39,969 --> 00:15:41,672
Then please sit there.

113
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:51,633
I have a secret that only you and my older brother know

114
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,609
Please listen calmly

115
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,297
I also say this as a doctor

116
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Gunpowder got into his body.

117
00:16:06,547 --> 00:16:12,429
and he has lost his qualifications as a husband physically

118
00:16:15,005 --> 00:16:16,795
Stop it! Don't say like that.

119
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,743
Don't say like that.

120
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,594
Why are you telling me such a story?

121
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,570
I don't want to hear it either

122
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:40,486
But once I start talking,
you have to listen quietly

123
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,048
And that's when our tragedy began

124
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:08,423
It's so hot today.

125
00:17:12,478 --> 00:17:13,932
You are so sweaty

126
00:17:14,561 --> 00:17:15,884
You need to take off your shirt quickly,

127
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:16,978
or you'll catch a cold

128
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:29,072
1.2.3.4.

129
00:18:09,076 --> 00:18:10,453
I'll go to bed.

130
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:11,689
Here's fine.

131
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:21,626
Please stay by my side for life.

132
00:18:22,627 --> 00:18:25,252
No matter what happens, I won't leave you.

133
00:18:29,955 --> 00:18:31,728
The clothes aren't dry yet.

134
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:33,908
I will dry it immediately.

135
00:18:39,924 --> 00:18:41,041
You scared me.

136
00:18:53,143 --> 00:18:55,111
Give me some water,Tomoko.

137
00:19:26,486 --> 00:19:27,814
What are you doing?

138
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:36,665
Don't you think you don't need this anymore?

139
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,595
You can't sleep?

140
00:21:08,853 --> 00:21:10,088
It's very cool tonight.

141
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:19,455
Shall I give you a massage?

142
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:32,681
That's enough already

143
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,134
I get it.

144
00:23:07,518 --> 00:23:10,096
Utsunomiya

145
00:23:18,557 --> 00:23:22,025
Military personnel change jobs frequently

146
00:23:32,564 --> 00:23:35,572
He came to Tokyo again.

147
00:23:38,853 --> 00:23:39,752
Come on.

148
00:23:42,135 --> 00:23:43,143
Oh no.

149
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:47,830
Madam

150
00:23:48,337 --> 00:23:50,065
He's going fishing again?

151
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,836
Yes, he'd loved it since a long time ago.

152
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,106
Oh, isn't he always with you?

153
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,009
I caught a bit of a cold today.

154
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,356
Hey,what's this?

155
00:23:57,486 --> 00:24:00,380
Hahaha, just one more step and the operation will be complete

156
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:03,530
Damn it, you're too strong.

157
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,029
This is alcohol, isn't it?

158
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,486
This is for you guys

159
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,330
Thank you very much.

160
00:24:09,355 --> 00:24:10,822
This makes me 100 times more energetic

161
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,876
Come on then

162
00:24:11,901 --> 00:24:14,712
What is that? Oh no!

163
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:17,166
I knew it would get better after all

164
00:24:19,494 --> 00:24:20,447
Oh no.

165
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,244
Madam,The boss sometimes goes fishing.

166
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,423
On most days, after work, he goes straight home to his wife, yes,

167
00:24:30,782 --> 00:24:33,188
He doesn't eat or drink much outside.

168
00:24:34,338 --> 00:24:36,658
He is a very loving husband

169
00:24:37,972 --> 00:24:40,972
I really have to treat you well.

170
00:24:41,173 --> 00:24:43,540
He always catches small fish.

171
00:24:47,173 --> 00:24:49,181
In the military community,

172
00:24:49,439 --> 00:24:51,469
it's considered shameful to cherish one's wife,

173
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,836
but I think that's outrageous.

174
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:54,416
Please stop flattering her.

175
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,353
This is not flattery

176
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:58,798
As a modern soldier, I thought I would take him as a model if I were to get a wife

177
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:04,361
For that, it's a requirement to have a beautiful wife like her.

178
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,509
You have no prospects.

179
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,057
Shout up.

180
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,752
Come on.

181
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,384
Welcome back.

182
00:25:55,697 --> 00:25:57,580
I didn't notice

183
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,103
It was cold outside?

184
00:26:04,944 --> 00:26:05,950
Who came?

185
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,394
They were Lieutenant Nogami and Lieutenant Shirosawa

186
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Lieutenant Fukami and then Lieutenant Koyama

187
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:18,158
Everyone is doing great, and it's
been a while since I joined them all.

188
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:22,610
You went to tie your hair up, didn't you?

189
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,122
I thought it would be rude not to change much

190
00:26:28,726 --> 00:26:33,916
I've never seen you so cheerful for such a long time.

191
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:39,855
You've never even put on makeup
when it's just the two of us

192
00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:41,916
because...

193
00:26:47,225 --> 00:26:48,078
what's going on?

194
00:26:49,028 --> 00:26:51,428
I've heard you're quite popular

195
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,896
You're a loving wife.

196
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:07,497
What were you feeling when you asked that?

197
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,348
Hurry up and clean that up

198
00:27:17,715 --> 00:27:20,060
Is the preparation for the drinks ready?

199
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,606
I'm sorry

200
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,634
I'll do that.

201
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,234
Don't get carried away

202
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:32,128
But didn't you say to everyone that I was feeling lonely and I should come and play?

203
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,257
Everyone was saying that

204
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,270
I truly appreciate your feelings

205
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:44,861
So...

206
00:27:45,436 --> 00:27:48,436
I'm not asking you to act like a geisha.

207
00:27:49,975 --> 00:27:50,615
But

208
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:54,849
You are stupid.

209
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:18,171
Who?

210
00:28:19,355 --> 00:28:20,392
it's me.

211
00:28:21,086 --> 00:28:22,299
I'll get out soon.

212
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:24,649
No, it's fine.

213
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,712
oh, you untied your hair, huh?

214
00:28:52,097 --> 00:28:53,297
oh, I'm so hungry

215
00:28:53,436 --> 00:28:55,495
You should drink some alcohol first

216
00:28:55,563 --> 00:28:56,909
but it's not good to drink alone.

217
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,088
How about you?

218
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:08,581
 Would you like one?

219
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,958
Thank you

220
00:29:15,983 --> 00:29:16,603
Sorry.

221
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,016
Ah, it's fine, it's fine

222
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,157
I couldn't reach,

223
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,026
so what? If you come over here...

224
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,655
Tomoko, I was wrong earlier.

225
00:29:43,897 --> 00:29:44,430
I apologize.

226
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:45,597
Don't say like that.

227
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,387
I understand that very well

228
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:50,781
Here it is.

229
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:52,175
Have another shot.

230
00:30:04,379 --> 00:30:07,379
Let's make up.

231
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:20,242
Forgive me....

232
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,630
It makes me sad to hear you say that so much

233
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,436
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

234
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:35,233
Come on, have a drink.

235
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,645
even though you couldn’t drink,you can drink now

236
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:51,050
Well, that's because I've been accompanying you every night

237
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:57,767
That's right, you have been working hard to master the art of drinking for my sake,

238
00:30:59,171 --> 00:31:01,058
You've been trying to comfort me in some way

239
00:31:02,276 --> 00:31:03,494
Not at all

240
00:31:04,552 --> 00:31:07,552
You are truly an impeccable wife

241
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I have no right to be husband.

242
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:17,530
Why do you say such a thing?

243
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:21,180
I see, this was a promise not to talk.

244
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:22,726
Sorry.

245
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:27,567
I've also become stronger with alcohol

246
00:31:28,033 --> 00:31:31,030
That's the power of that grand exercise

247
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:31,787
You.

248
00:31:34,546 --> 00:31:36,788
Oh right, my bad, my bad

249
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,876
It's good to be drunk tonight, right?

250
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,275
Let's do that, shall we drink and sing a song?

251
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:46,825
Please.

252
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:49,156
I will also have some and be set free

253
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:51,431
Let's do that.

254
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,850
You forgot the promise again, didn't you?

255
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:25,836
That's right, this song was like that too

256
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,120
Why do you keep saying things like that tonight?

257
00:32:34,011 --> 00:32:37,759
I hope you will still wear makeup even when it's just the two of us

258
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,427
You are gradually losing your feminine emotions

259
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:52,428
Even with a husband like me, I still want you to be a woman and a beautiful woman.

260
00:32:54,371 --> 00:32:58,751
Tomoko, I ask you, I entrust this to you.

261
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,367
He will soon become a lieutenant general

262
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,316
And he was appointed as the Undersecretary of the Army

263
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
and will be living in the official residence

264
00:33:19,676 --> 00:33:20,733
Madam

265
00:33:27,238 --> 00:33:28,404
I am Kyohei Sakai

266
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,740
I just received a call from my husband

267
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,175
I was asked to paint a portrait in celebration of her promotion

268
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,802
Thank you for your hard work, and I appreciate your work.

269
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:44,180
I will do my best to paint

270
00:33:44,546 --> 00:33:46,489
Grandma, please guide him to the room we just decided on

271
00:33:47,156 --> 00:33:48,423
Please come with me.

272
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:55,092
By the way, Mr. Sakai will be living at home from now on

273
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,616
Well, this isn't a very good painting, is it?

274
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,650
Is that so? But Takashima really like it, especially

275
00:34:07,702 --> 00:34:10,702
Well, it was painted with a lot of effort

276
00:34:12,382 --> 00:34:15,382
It seems that Takashima really values Mr. Sakai as a person

277
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:20,249
When it comes to his affection, he truly takes good care of him, doesn't he?

278
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,516
Takashima is someone who doesn't really understand art well

279
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,708
My older brother is trying to distract himself from his loneliness in some way

280
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,916
By the way, how is it going?

281
00:34:37,645 --> 00:34:38,936
What do you mean?

282
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,531
Well, I really think it's great to meet you

283
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,263
I wonder why

284
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:51,546
Having stood in dangerous places as a woman for a long time

285
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,052
and it doesn't show at all

286
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:57,471
You don't forget about that.

287
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,980
At your age, it's not something you can easily forget

288
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:06,510
But you are being pushed to a place you must not forget

289
00:35:07,779 --> 00:35:09,336
You're holding back your youth.

290
00:35:11,036 --> 00:35:14,726
Well, you see, I can say this bluntly
because I am a doctor.

291
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:19,907
Sister, you have never consulted me

292
00:35:20,078 --> 00:35:20,784
Kazuma.

293
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:25,350
Please go home if you wanna talk about that.

294
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,175
I can't tolerate such an insult to Takashima

295
00:35:33,366 --> 00:35:35,972
I said something trivial

296
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,450
I apologize

297
00:35:40,997 --> 00:35:43,997
I'm off to draw

298
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:46,299
Take care.

299
00:35:54,656 --> 00:35:55,556
Is that Sakai-kun?

300
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:11,873
Eventually,Sakai-san's paintings started to
be selected for exhibitions multiple times

301
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,256
It seems that guy's reputation in society has improved quite a bit.

302
00:36:23,592 --> 00:36:26,132
Hey, why don't you try to make him to draw a portrait of you?

303
00:36:26,516 --> 00:36:27,909
I don't have to

304
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,159
We can hang my painting alongside yours.

305
00:36:32,913 --> 00:36:36,226
Make him best work.

306
00:37:06,502 --> 00:37:07,202
What's wrong?

307
00:37:12,497 --> 00:37:14,611
I can't.

308
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:28,583
Why not?

309
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,940
Your wife is just too beautiful

310
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,810
The painting is going to be redone again

311
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:09,295
But for me, being a model almost every day is becoming increasingly difficult

312
00:38:26,238 --> 00:38:27,262
Turn this way!

313
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:56,738
Please, Sakai-san

314
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,184
That's all for today.

315
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:28,310
How about the portrait?

316
00:39:29,682 --> 00:39:30,368
Not yet

317
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,620
It seems that Sakai has been studying quite a bit

318
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,966
I think I'm going to take a little break

319
00:39:37,644 --> 00:39:37,951
Why?

320
00:39:38,896 --> 00:39:40,323
I'm feeling very tired

321
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:41,745
I see.

322
00:39:44,901 --> 00:39:51,496
By the way, I'm going to travel to Hokkaido for about
three months starting tomorrow

323
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,744
Is it going to be that long?

324
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:56,210
I hope your beautiful portrait will be finished in the meantime,

325
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,980
That adds one more thing to look forward to

326
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,940
Well then, I'll go wipe off some sweat

327
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,518
When do I start drawing?

328
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:17,201
I don't know.

329
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:34,271
shortly after he departed,

330
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:38,176
the terrible day of fate arrived

331
00:40:41,813 --> 00:40:45,855
It's a hot and uncomfortable night

332
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,030
Who?

333
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,125
It's me

334
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:18,903
Sakai? What happened to you now?

335
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:20,935
I can't sleep

336
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,099
I'm worried about the painting

337
00:42:24,158 --> 00:42:25,334
about the painting?

338
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:29,098
it's your painting

339
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:30,497
Why?

340
00:42:33,694 --> 00:42:34,401
I can't draw it well.

341
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,720
Is my face that difficult to draw?

342
00:42:48,006 --> 00:42:52,368
I can't draw it well.

343
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,084
There's no wind

344
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:05,047
What happened?

345
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,087
The spider's web.

346
00:43:58,789 --> 00:44:01,376
oh dear, no, no, no,I don't wanna hear it.

347
00:44:02,764 --> 00:44:03,537
Sakiko

348
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:09,004
Just now, I despise you.

349
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,980
but please listen to the end

350
00:44:21,602 --> 00:44:25,762
Sit here and listen carefully,

351
00:44:26,203 --> 00:44:29,203
no matter how much I'm despised or hated, it's fine

352
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,770
Eventually, your father returned from Hokkaido

353
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,924
the car has arrived

354
00:44:46,421 --> 00:44:46,961
Come in.

355
00:44:55,510 --> 00:44:59,611
You must be aware of the recent Manchuria

356
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:01,370
Yes.

357
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:05,450
 I also don't know when the time will come for us to part ways

358
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:12,499
Thank you for putting up with someone like me until now

359
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:17,541
You are also a pitiful woman

360
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:27,983
In this day and age, even if a military man's wife were to remarry after my death, society would not allow to re-marriage.

361
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:31,510
Please forgive me

362
00:45:34,183 --> 00:45:34,922
You.

363
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:39,670
I just want to say this while I still can

364
00:46:08,973 --> 00:46:11,172
Bring the comfort bags later.

365
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:33,442
Why are you trying to avoid me?

366
00:46:34,873 --> 00:46:40,763
We live together.
I feel it's cruelty.

367
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,720
Don't get me wrong.

368
00:46:46,766 --> 00:46:49,766
Then please leave here and marry me

369
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,472
I can't do that

370
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,357
Why can't you do it?

371
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,587
What will happen to Takashima if you do that?

372
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:05,484
So what will happen to me?

373
00:47:10,842 --> 00:47:12,684
Does that mean you no longer loves me?

374
00:47:12,845 --> 00:47:13,745
Stop it

375
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:19,042
it's the hardest thing for me to hear

376
00:47:41,863 --> 00:47:44,863
Wife, I have thought about dying many times

377
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:48,390
But I couldn't even do that

378
00:47:51,350 --> 00:47:55,370
You will be born.
I had to live strongly for you.

379
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,626
What did you say to do it again?

380
00:48:11,823 --> 00:48:12,856
I'm pregnant.

381
00:48:18,681 --> 00:48:19,929
Please feel free to divorce me

382
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,866
Whose child is it?

383
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,327
Sakai's.

384
00:48:27,868 --> 00:48:28,434
Sakai's?

385
00:48:37,069 --> 00:48:39,095
Get your hands off of me!

386
00:48:45,406 --> 00:48:46,086
You.

387
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:49,509
please cut me off

388
00:49:29,347 --> 00:49:30,363
Tomoko

389
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:32,360
Yes.

390
00:50:01,328 --> 00:50:03,823
It shouldn't have been like this.

391
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:11,517
I was excited without thinking about my age.
I'm sorry.

392
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:16,887
I was wrong.

393
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,431
You're still young

394
00:50:24,767 --> 00:50:26,594
and your youth is being sealed away

395
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:31,386
I never thought you would go through life without any mistakes

396
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,453
The two of us are a married couple

397
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:40,938
I'll take the child.

398
00:50:42,615 --> 00:50:44,389
It's for us, after all

399
00:50:47,394 --> 00:50:51,735
Why do you show me such pity?

400
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:54,899
Why don't you blame me more?

401
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:03,344
I have lost my qualifications as a husband

402
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:08,700
Yet you have served me well

403
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,907
I am truly grateful

404
00:51:16,590 --> 00:51:19,159
I have forgiven you

405
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:23,226
If I think about you not being here,

406
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,670
I can endure anything

407
00:51:51,288 --> 00:51:55,365
Please give me your wife

408
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,022
What?

409
00:51:56,794 --> 00:51:57,620
Please

410
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,096
Please give her to me

411
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,982
No way!

412
00:52:00,899 --> 00:52:02,681
But we have children...

413
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:03,528
the child is mine

414
00:52:05,062 --> 00:52:07,136
To call it your own child, Your Excellency, is cowardly

415
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:07,452
What?

416
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,173
Your Excellency is only thinking about your own reputation

417
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:10,818
So...

418
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,385
What?

419
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:15,110
Whose help has allowed you to draw until today?

420
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,076
That's a separate issue from love

421
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:18,940
Shut up!

422
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:20,442
Yes, it is a separate issue

423
00:52:20,684 --> 00:52:21,579
What?

424
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:32,023
Get out!

425
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:56,920
Tomoko.

426
00:52:57,802 --> 00:53:00,802
Did you talk to Sakai?

427
00:53:01,501 --> 00:53:02,195
For what?

428
00:53:02,738 --> 00:53:05,094
Did you talk to Sakai that I couldn’t have sex?

429
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:05,831
Never.

430
00:53:09,865 --> 00:53:10,870
Thank you

431
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:18,544
I let Sakai to have another house.

432
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:22,000
That's better.

433
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,020
Your father became fond of the Sanbo headquarters,

434
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:44,416
and we moved to our current home

435
00:53:46,089 --> 00:53:49,089
And that is when you were born

436
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,921
Thanks to you, the Takashima family is filled with a brightness as if dawn has broken

437
00:54:14,292 --> 00:54:19,642
And it was around the time when news of the Greater East Asia War began to be reported in the town every day

438
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:01,275
Oh dear, are you sleepy, Sakiko?

439
00:55:02,948 --> 00:55:06,362
Sakiko is feeling a bit worn out
Father, I see,

440
00:55:07,770 --> 00:55:09,323
I'm sorry about that

441
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,784
Next time, I'll sing for you again

442
00:55:26,165 --> 00:55:27,315
Good night.

443
00:56:02,222 --> 00:56:03,558
Hi Madam.

444
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,276
it's unusual for you

445
00:56:07,692 --> 00:56:10,323
Since you're not here, I wrote you a letter.

446
00:56:10,792 --> 00:56:13,081
I was planning to go home

447
00:56:14,222 --> 00:56:15,097
but I understand

448
00:56:20,493 --> 00:56:22,557
You're drunk again, aren't you?

449
00:56:23,339 --> 00:56:24,073
Again?

450
00:56:26,917 --> 00:56:30,331
I drink alcohol every day

451
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:35,159
That's not healthy for you

452
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,762
You know everything.

453
00:56:44,745 --> 00:56:47,667
Takashima also says the same thing.

454
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,690
He said?

455
00:57:00,735 --> 00:57:03,735
Mr. Sakai, this...

456
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:07,706
What's this?

457
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,190
I would like to receive that painting you made

458
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:17,169
I don't want

459
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:29,827
I don't want to lose to his kindness.

460
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:33,338
Being treated kindly is painful for me

461
00:57:38,008 --> 00:57:42,901
Takashima thinks he is sending you money every month

462
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,656
What?

463
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:51,307
Takashima thinks that Sakiko is making amends for what she took from you

464
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,198
But you don't accept it

465
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,917
I feel pain

466
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,081
I'm the one who is suffering more

467
00:58:07,278 --> 00:58:13,581
I'm waiting forever for my wife to come here.

468
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:20,440
You are a terrible person

469
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:28,206
It's a terrible mistake to try to avoid me while
knowing my feelings so well; just once is enough

470
00:58:32,847 --> 00:58:34,417
Once is enough.

471
00:58:37,870 --> 00:58:40,870
So, you are okay with trying to isolate me forever, huh?

472
00:58:45,245 --> 00:58:45,855
Madam.

473
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:51,518
Takashima has already been given up on by the doctor so please don't bother

474
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:03,503
We have to evacuate

475
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:24,960
Soon after, your father passed
away while worrying about you

476
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,940
Eventually, the war came to an end

477
00:59:45,349 --> 00:59:54,281
Mr. Sakai became a top-notch painter and gradually transformed
into someone who seemed to have attained a certain enlightenment,

478
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:57,840
and before long, he started coming to visit our home

479
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:03,330
It was because he wanted to see you more than myself

480
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,492
Ah, welcome

481
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,700
I thought your painting had changed quite a bit as I was looking at it

482
01:00:16,668 --> 01:00:17,985
It's becoming quite a reflection

483
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:22,146
Where's Sakiko?

484
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,774
She's going to school.

485
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:26,805
Is she not home?

486
01:00:34,782 --> 01:00:35,891
Madam.

487
01:00:38,032 --> 01:00:39,055
I have something to say.

488
01:00:40,312 --> 01:00:42,525
What's going on?

489
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:50,005
I've been feeling lately that my work
is less important than Sakiko

490
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:57,266
Please forgive me for saying something that will make you suffer again

491
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,047
I never thought the pain of not being able to call myself a parent would be this great

492
01:01:11,030 --> 01:01:14,426
It would have been better
if I hadn't seen Sakiko since that time

493
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:15,821
Mr. Sakai

494
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,906
So what do you want me to do?

495
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:21,844
It's even more painful
because I don't understand that

496
01:01:25,910 --> 01:01:30,164
Even if I claim to be her parent now, Sakiko probably won't believe me

497
01:01:33,061 --> 01:01:35,578
It's better for that child to not know

498
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:39,961
Yes, I think so too

499
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:47,922
Mr. Sakai, you've been quite weak lately

500
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:53,727
I can't even draw.

501
01:01:55,352 --> 01:01:57,118
I drink alcohol every day.

502
01:02:16,633 --> 01:02:17,961
Here.

503
01:02:24,342 --> 01:02:27,342
Please go.

504
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:33,110
What,Mom?

505
01:02:34,137 --> 01:02:36,031
please come in.

506
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,774
Uncle

507
01:03:04,384 --> 01:03:05,126
Uncle.

508
01:03:17,548 --> 01:03:18,391
Are you here?

509
01:03:22,134 --> 01:03:23,587
Oh Sakiko.

510
01:03:25,367 --> 01:03:28,977
Just now, mother said I became the model for you.

511
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:33,071
Mother said that?

512
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:40,617
I'm really grateful and happy

513
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:45,821
I will tidy up my room.

514
01:03:50,313 --> 01:03:53,852
I've been wanting to draw you
for a while

515
01:03:54,810 --> 01:03:55,336
That's right.

516
01:03:55,812 --> 01:03:58,812
But this is my first time being Model.

517
01:04:00,361 --> 01:04:02,414
so just sit comfortably and that's all that matters

518
01:04:03,387 --> 01:04:05,071
Come on in

519
01:04:07,823 --> 01:04:10,823
The white scarf is really nice

520
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,126
You look good.

521
01:04:16,339 --> 01:04:17,875
Come on, sit in this chair.

522
01:04:33,368 --> 01:04:34,493
and try reading it.

523
01:04:55,618 --> 01:04:56,665
Don't move your legs.

524
01:05:03,282 --> 01:05:04,048
Wow, that's nice

525
01:05:05,977 --> 01:05:06,618
Good.

526
01:05:09,468 --> 01:05:12,468
This is going to be my great work.

527
01:05:13,578 --> 01:05:16,750
But I've been using it for a long time, you know

528
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,466
Okay, okay, I understand

529
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:24,490
Do it now, before your feelings change.

530
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:30,070
Sakiko, let's turn a little more to the right

531
01:05:47,884 --> 01:05:48,618
Align your eyes

532
01:06:02,766 --> 01:06:03,587
I'm home.

533
01:06:03,612 --> 01:06:04,961
Welcome back

534
01:06:04,986 --> 01:06:05,938
I'm starving.

535
01:06:06,102 --> 01:06:07,110
Bring her some donuts.

536
01:06:10,438 --> 01:06:11,774
Did you visit Sakai?

537
01:06:12,087 --> 01:06:13,751
You told me so.

538
01:06:14,164 --> 01:06:15,055
Thank you for your work.

539
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:18,798
Was he drinking alcohol?

540
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:21,126
His room smells like alcohol

541
01:06:21,151 --> 01:06:21,969
Oh.

542
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:30,000
Who exactly is that man?

543
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:34,141
He used to be a painter at our house a long time ago

544
01:06:34,830 --> 01:06:37,726
Father is being very kind and taking care of you, isn't he?

545
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:40,246
I wonder why he isn't getting married?

546
01:06:40,271 --> 01:06:41,134
I have no idea.

547
01:06:41,649 --> 01:06:43,270
He's really unusual

548
01:06:43,706 --> 01:06:46,706
So, Sakiko, have you started on your painting yet?

549
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,176
But I ended up not liking it

550
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:50,903
Why?

551
01:06:51,144 --> 01:06:53,417
Because he's looking at me with such creepy eyes

552
01:06:54,274 --> 01:06:57,430
Well, anyone would feel a bit creeped out when drawing

553
01:06:57,455 --> 01:07:00,455
I really dislike him,

554
01:07:00,696 --> 01:07:03,305
Sakiko shouldn't say things like that

555
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,289
Oh, why is that?

556
01:07:06,621 --> 01:07:08,633
Why is it wrong to say I dislike someone?

557
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,079
Well...

558
01:07:14,518 --> 01:07:16,992
I don't want to be a model

559
01:07:17,668 --> 01:07:20,102
Sakai-san seem very happy?

560
01:07:20,493 --> 01:07:21,876
I really dislike him.

561
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:57,891
Are you tired?

562
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,960
but it's better to finish quickly

563
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,086
What are you doing?

564
01:08:21,204 --> 01:08:23,118
 Hurry up and draw it!

565
01:08:24,423 --> 01:08:25,243
I can't draw that fast!

566
01:08:26,340 --> 01:08:27,602
Why?

567
01:08:28,289 --> 01:08:33,461
I'm putting my life into this job

568
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:35,328
I don't like this,

569
01:08:37,656 --> 01:08:38,930
Sakiko!

570
01:08:41,212 --> 01:08:42,954
Don't you believe in my work?

571
01:08:44,048 --> 01:08:44,727
Huh? Sakiko!

572
01:08:49,289 --> 01:08:50,065
What are you going to do?

573
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:50,766
I'm going home

574
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:53,943
Why you act like that?

575
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:55,344
What?

576
01:08:55,663 --> 01:08:57,555
Did you ask my mother?

577
01:08:57,696 --> 01:08:59,930
Were you our painter at our house long ago?

578
01:09:15,977 --> 01:09:16,923
Excuse me.

579
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:20,571
Don't go.

580
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:23,414
I'm sorry.

581
01:09:27,134 --> 01:09:29,251
Now is the most important time.

582
01:09:33,329 --> 01:09:34,743
Please.

583
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:34,739
You did something good for him.

584
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:41,922
But you know, I thought that thinking about it
later might actually make Sakai-san suffer more

585
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,211
However, regardless of Sakai-kun, he can see Sakiko right in front of him every day.

586
01:10:53,230 --> 01:10:57,719
Truly, suffering continues to come one after another

587
01:10:58,970 --> 01:11:01,970
When Mr. Sakai expressed his love as a father,

588
01:11:03,516 --> 01:11:04,774
I was really in trouble.

589
01:11:06,281 --> 01:11:07,649
Is that so?

590
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:11,790
Does Sakiko dislike Mr. Sakai?

591
01:11:12,430 --> 01:11:16,432
Yes, lately it has been getting worse and worse

592
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:20,620
Well, that's something common for girls around that age

593
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:22,918
Is that so?

594
01:11:22,943 --> 01:11:24,020
I'm home.

595
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:25,177
She's back.

596
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,970
Then let's see if I can manage to talk things through smoothly

597
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,614
Please

598
01:11:37,324 --> 01:11:38,260
Welcome

599
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:41,550
I've been told that you've been modeling for Sakai-kun lately

600
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,476
Is it already done for today?

601
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:47,500
Am I not going anymore?

602
01:11:47,692 --> 01:11:48,480
Why?

603
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:53,090
He is very disgusting

604
01:11:53,686 --> 01:11:57,153
artists are always a bit eccentric, you know

605
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:58,984
But I don't like it

606
01:11:59,450 --> 01:12:00,836
There are other models, right?

607
01:12:01,789 --> 01:12:06,285
Mr. Sakai is saying he wants to draw you

608
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:16,060
I want to ask my mother
why she told me to go to someone like that

609
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:17,825
Sakiko.

610
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,824
I don't know what happened, but if you quit halfway,

611
01:12:21,867 --> 01:12:23,063
it will be a problem for Sakai-kun too

612
01:12:24,858 --> 01:12:26,403
Could you please go?

613
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:27,325
No.

614
01:14:13,070 --> 01:14:16,070
Around the time of Mr. Sakai's first anniversary

615
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:19,620
Mr. Kazuma has brought your marriage proposal

616
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:25,582
I can assure both the person and the family sufficiently, you know

617
01:14:27,535 --> 01:14:30,271
Could you leave one thing to me?

618
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,051
I believe it's quite a significant matter, is it not?

619
01:14:33,380 --> 01:14:35,567
Well, if you say that,

620
01:14:35,592 --> 01:14:38,262
it makes it worthwhile for me to take care of her

621
01:14:41,717 --> 01:14:43,356
Sakiko is not here?

622
01:14:45,070 --> 01:14:50,100
That child seems to be avoiding me lately

623
01:14:51,114 --> 01:14:52,028
That's bad.

624
01:14:52,418 --> 01:14:56,106
She makes various excuses to leave the house

625
01:14:57,509 --> 01:14:58,965
She might be thinking about Sakai.

626
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,380
Isn't that a bit of an overreaction?

627
01:15:04,016 --> 01:15:07,016
It's time to send her off to her husband

628
01:15:07,692 --> 01:15:08,895
Mom.

629
01:15:10,598 --> 01:15:11,473
welcome back

630
01:15:11,606 --> 01:15:12,403
I'm home.

631
01:15:12,428 --> 01:15:13,520
Muraki is here.

632
01:15:13,684 --> 01:15:15,544
Please show him to the reception room.

633
01:15:17,904 --> 01:15:19,021
who is Muraki?

634
01:15:19,194 --> 01:15:20,185
He's an art dealer

635
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:26,951
He's been saying for a while now that he wants to hold an exhibition of Mr. Sakai's posthumous works

636
01:15:27,598 --> 01:15:33,506
Well, as for me, I would like to keep only the paintings of my husband

637
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,840
and Sakiko, and sell everything else

638
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:44,170
I see, that makes sense. It's better to let go of painful memories quickly

639
01:15:46,436 --> 01:15:48,116
Excuse me.

640
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,342
please call Sakiko for me

641
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:13,646
uncle?

642
01:16:14,418 --> 01:16:15,162
Over here

643
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:29,406
It seems like you haven't been getting along with mother lately

644
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:30,729
That's not true.

645
01:16:31,362 --> 01:16:32,818
Well, if that's the case,

646
01:16:33,043 --> 01:16:35,974
You need to get along
since it's just you and me.

647
01:16:36,126 --> 01:16:40,365
I wonder if mother is hiding something from me?

648
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:41,989
What do you mean hiding?

649
01:16:42,162 --> 01:16:43,482
 I don't really know,

650
01:16:43,507 --> 01:16:44,279
but it feels like there might be something

651
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:45,912
I don't think so.

652
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,140
It's rare to find such a wonderful mother

653
01:16:50,267 --> 01:16:52,279
Well, I think so too.

654
01:16:53,897 --> 01:16:54,756
By the way,

655
01:16:56,292 --> 01:16:57,084
How about it?

656
01:16:57,235 --> 01:16:58,787
Do you have any intention of getting married?

657
01:16:58,920 --> 01:16:59,693
Oh dear,

658
01:17:01,665 --> 01:17:05,623
Even if you're shy, I'll encourage you.

659
01:17:05,678 --> 01:17:06,686
After all, I don't want to either

660
01:17:07,896 --> 01:17:10,474
Even your mother is worried about you
in her own way

661
01:17:11,260 --> 01:17:13,336
Well, I'll leave some photos behind too

662
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,701
Take your time to think and reply later.

663
01:17:15,834 --> 01:17:17,139
It troubles me.

664
01:17:17,170 --> 01:17:19,725
Don't say like that.

665
01:17:34,313 --> 01:17:37,337
I was surprised that things are progressing so smoothly.

666
01:17:37,448 --> 01:17:40,904
She really is a strong-willed child, you know

667
01:17:41,165 --> 01:17:44,165
I didn't expect her to agree so readily

668
01:17:44,502 --> 01:17:47,502
I wonder if this is what a true good match really is

669
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:55,060
Yes, thank you

670
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,200
My eyesight has really gotten worse, hasn't it?

671
01:17:59,790 --> 01:18:02,790
It will be lonely when I'm gone, won't it?

672
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:07,748
I can only imagine how lonely the young lady must feel

673
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:10,836
I often think how nice it would be

674
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:12,349
if only her husband were here

675
01:18:12,978 --> 01:18:15,978
Dad is such a fool, not even watching me get married

676
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:18,209
Yeah.

677
01:18:20,731 --> 01:18:23,731
Is this enough?

678
01:18:25,110 --> 01:18:28,110
Please ask your mom about it

679
01:18:47,248 --> 01:18:50,522
She would be happier if she never knew about it.

680
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:55,865
I used to think that way,

681
01:18:56,530 --> 01:18:59,530
but I can no longer keep this hidden any longer

682
01:18:59,757 --> 01:19:01,253
But she's supposed to get married

683
01:19:01,670 --> 01:19:02,966
Now that it's come to this...

684
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:04,779
I think it's time to finally open up

685
01:19:06,161 --> 01:19:07,881
I wonder if that's true.

686
01:19:08,022 --> 01:19:11,678
Sakai died without letting her know this.

687
01:19:11,969 --> 01:19:17,473
If I let her know about it, I think it will be a good memorial for Sakai on the first anniversary of her death.

688
01:19:20,050 --> 01:19:22,286
Despite being her real parent,

689
01:19:22,326 --> 01:19:27,051
His daughter didn't think he was her father. I feel so sorry for him.

690
01:20:03,550 --> 01:20:04,910
My father is a liar.

691
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,137
That's cowardly.

692
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:33,724
Well, I'll head over to Exhibition of Mr. Sakai's posthumous works

693
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:36,449
then, is that okay?

694
01:20:39,820 --> 01:20:42,820
Sakiko.

695
01:20:44,872 --> 01:20:45,825
Sakiko.

696
01:21:27,154 --> 01:21:28,606
What are you doing?

697
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:30,020
Get your hands off of me!

698
01:21:30,083 --> 01:21:31,192
Calm down.

699
01:21:33,199 --> 01:21:37,778
You said you cut it because you felt sorry for yourself in that painting

700
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:44,692
That's right, it's embarrassing to have anyone see such a dirty painting.

701
01:21:46,567 --> 01:21:48,590
You're cowardly and a liar

702
01:21:50,023 --> 01:21:53,023
Father and Mr. Sakai are all liars too

703
01:21:54,710 --> 01:22:00,046
Sakiko, it was wrong for Mother
to hide things until now, but...

704
01:22:00,070 --> 01:22:04,630
I intend for you to know everything
when you get married

705
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:09,394
I think it's terrible to ask for
understanding of the parents' secrets now

706
01:22:09,941 --> 01:22:12,941
I'm not just asking for your understanding

707
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:18,770
I opened up thinking that I was okay to be looked down upon or blamed, no matter what

708
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:24,332
It's because I truly wanted you to have a genuinely happy and correct marriage

709
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:26,056
Marriage is just foolish

710
01:22:26,087 --> 01:22:26,778
Sakiko

711
01:22:27,398 --> 01:22:30,886
Everyone is a liar. Living together for decades
is terrifying.

712
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,669
I hate marriage.

713
01:22:41,338 --> 01:22:45,676
Sakiko, you liked your father, didn't you?

714
01:22:47,207 --> 01:22:48,918
I loved him very much

715
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:52,740
Your mother resented that father, you know

716
01:22:53,590 --> 01:22:54,801
Just once

717
01:22:55,669 --> 01:22:58,374
On that summer night, it was just once.

718
01:22:59,291 --> 01:23:00,637
That's a lie, a lie

719
01:23:00,786 --> 01:23:01,466
Sakiko.

720
01:23:01,661 --> 01:23:02,981
from that lie, I was born

721
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,016
I am not my father's child

722
01:23:05,055 --> 01:23:08,055
No, you are definitely your father's child

723
01:23:10,182 --> 01:23:12,801
He truly love you.

724
01:23:13,718 --> 01:23:18,754
With great affection, he really cherishes you

725
01:23:21,970 --> 01:23:24,970
That made it even harder for my mother

726
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,300
I am also in a lot of pain

727
01:23:29,590 --> 01:23:31,504
I understand very well

728
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,262
But you know, Sakiko,

729
01:23:35,319 --> 01:23:40,957
There are many things in the world that you
can't possibly understand with your current youth

730
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:45,466
I think as you get older,

731
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:49,418
you'll come to understand what it truly means to be a weak human being

732
01:23:51,150 --> 01:23:56,012
You are still young and beautiful, and everything is ahead of you

733
01:23:57,730 --> 01:24:03,470
Stop dwelling on your mother's past mistakes
and thinking negatively about yourself

734
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:07,080
Please hold onto brighter hopes and become stronger

735
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,110
That is the most important thing for you right now

736
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:15,990
Hey, be happy for my sake too.

737
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:23,043
Your happiness is what your late father and Mr. Sakai would be the happiest about

738
01:24:26,690 --> 01:24:28,223
Did you understand?

739
01:24:40,653 --> 01:24:41,434
Adjust your posture.

740
01:24:49,285 --> 01:24:55,699
my father often said this to encourage me when I was feeling down

741
01:24:56,255 --> 01:24:57,137
Mom.

742
01:24:58,622 --> 01:24:59,442
What?

743
01:25:00,076 --> 01:25:03,076
I'm sorry for bullying you, mother.

744
01:25:17,075 --> 01:25:17,864
Adjust your posture.

745
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:25,395
Sakiko.

746
01:25:53,723 --> 01:25:55,012
Dawn is breaking.

747
01:26:06,927 --> 01:26:08,645
Do you want to sleep?

748
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:18,387
Please wear this for me.

749
01:27:25,645 --> 01:27:27,403
You look so beautiful.

750
01:27:33,372 --> 01:27:35,786
Come over here and give me a good look.

751
01:27:58,398 --> 01:28:00,692
Wow,it's so warm.

752
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,819
This is the first time I've seen such a beautiful sunrise.

753
01:28:36,745 --> 01:28:43,518
The End

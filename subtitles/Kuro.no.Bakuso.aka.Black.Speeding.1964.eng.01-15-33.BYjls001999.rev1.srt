00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:21,196
Black Speeding (1964)

3
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:14,409
Three Motorcycles Ahead.
Stop by left.

4
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:18,667
Three Motorcycles Ahead.
Stop by left.

5
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:55,489
Oh it's a problem!

6
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,145
Mom!

7
00:04:01,145 --> 00:04:03,208
Where's her mom?

8
00:04:03,973 --> 00:04:04,731
Do you know who it is?

9
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,153
35 house's Yamazaki's?

10
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:09,434
Please get his mother in here right away.

11
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,934
Someone call 119 and ask for an ambulance.

12
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:12,613
Thank you very much.

13
00:04:12,973 --> 00:04:13,911
Is there a police box near here?

14
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:18,997
Does anyone have a handkerchief?

15
00:04:24,379 --> 00:04:24,965
It's a hit and run incident.

16
00:04:25,262 --> 00:04:26,059
That Motorcycle?

17
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:26,903
Where he has gone?

18
00:04:27,036 --> 00:04:28,028
He went to No.2 Keihin.

19
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:31,884
I'm Tsuda from the Mobile Police Force.
I'll chase them.

20
00:04:32,845 --> 00:04:33,650
You'll be fine.

21
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,289
2m...18

22
00:05:41,227 --> 00:05:42,297
It's terrible.

23
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,750
We can't let our kids play outside.

24
00:05:44,937 --> 00:05:47,124
A big bike ran into him.

25
00:05:47,149 --> 00:05:50,421
It's terrible.

26
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:01,970
Did you catch him?

27
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:05,580
Did you catch him?

28
00:06:05,814 --> 00:06:06,611
I missed him.

29
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:07,791
So, ambulance?

30
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:12,142
I took him right away, but I don't know if that's gonna work.
He was unconscious.

31
00:06:24,822 --> 00:06:26,752
My husband isn't here yet?

32
00:06:26,971 --> 00:06:29,127
I don't know.

33
00:06:36,353 --> 00:06:38,252
Surgery is about to begin. Please come in.

34
00:06:40,573 --> 00:06:43,713
How's the condition of the child who's about to undergo surgery?

35
00:06:44,229 --> 00:06:45,588
He has a compound fracture of the femur.

36
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:47,159
He'll be better?

37
00:06:47,315 --> 00:06:49,635
He has severe internal bleeding and may not survive.

38
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,720
I'm Yamazaki,Where's my son.

39
00:06:53,923 --> 00:06:55,649
Please enter the first operating room.

40
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:14,314
The photos has done yet?

41
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,853
I have to bring the photo by today.

42
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,179
Don't be so hasty.

43
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,578
But it's unusual for you.
I can't believe he got away.

44
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:28,851
He's a vicious bastard.

45
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:45,179
He should've been caught.
It's your fault for running off like that.

46
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:47,405
Don't worry.
He'll be back.

47
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,882
Our boss is upset.

48
00:07:54,347 --> 00:07:55,066
Did you escape?

49
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,792
Yeah.
Where's boss?

50
00:07:57,308 --> 00:07:58,230
He's waiting.

51
00:08:15,597 --> 00:08:17,074
He said thank you.

52
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:23,473
Police chased you?

53
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:25,684
Just little.

54
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:28,551
Don't push yourself too hard.

55
00:08:29,355 --> 00:08:31,066
I've made my job.

56
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:34,990
Your money.

57
00:08:40,756 --> 00:08:43,077
This is unclear.

58
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:44,952
My bad.

59
00:08:45,499 --> 00:08:46,842
You remember the number?

60
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:50,131
I couldn't check because of the mud on the plate.

61
00:08:51,513 --> 00:08:53,021
If only you could take a clear photo

62
00:08:53,412 --> 00:08:54,435
Which type?

63
00:08:54,646 --> 00:08:55,709
Did you check it?

64
00:08:56,357 --> 00:08:57,701
I think it's Skyliners.

65
00:08:58,713 --> 00:08:59,588
I'm sure

66
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,236
I think it's year 63 type.

67
00:09:01,283 --> 00:09:02,627
I think so.

68
00:09:03,798 --> 00:09:07,243
No confirmed accidents photographed for the two motorcycles that fled earlier.

69
00:09:07,267 --> 00:09:10,400
So, if that's the case...
I guess we'll just have to find this hit-and-run guy.

70
00:09:11,588 --> 00:09:14,713
Anyway, let's find all the owners of the '63 Skyliners.

71
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:17,119
Let's do it.

72
00:09:19,189 --> 00:09:24,454
Please work harder for us.

73
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,478
Please let me use your phone.

74
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:30,260
The only clue we have is the TYPE of this bike.

75
00:09:30,549 --> 00:09:32,853
If he dismantle the bike, this lead will disappear.

76
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:34,158
So We don't have time.

77
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,416
I get it.

78
00:09:37,392 --> 00:09:41,627
Is this the Central Public Hospital?
I'm from the Metropolitan Police Department's riot police.

79
00:09:42,186 --> 00:09:45,311
Are these the results of Yamazaki Tamio's surgery?

80
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,995
He's saved?

81
00:09:51,753 --> 00:09:54,714
That's good.
Thank you very much.

82
00:09:59,449 --> 00:10:01,292
Thank you very much.

83
00:10:09,371 --> 00:10:10,089
Sorry.

84
00:10:10,114 --> 00:10:10,987
What's wrong?

85
00:10:11,012 --> 00:10:12,042
There was a traffic accident.

86
00:10:12,067 --> 00:10:13,566
Welcome.

87
00:10:14,173 --> 00:10:15,930
I'm looking for this.

88
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:19,173
What time do you think it is?

89
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:23,141
They said if you weren't here by six they would turn the room over to someone else.

90
00:10:23,649 --> 00:10:26,157
Then why didn't you at least go and see?

91
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,384
I can't do that.
We should go together.

92
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:33,602
We can't get married without a room.

93
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,032
I know.
Don't be upset.

94
00:10:37,407 --> 00:10:38,266
Can you go out?

95
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:41,415
I'm supposed to be out by 6:00.

96
00:10:41,532 --> 00:10:42,704
Let's go see a movie.

97
00:10:43,286 --> 00:10:44,615
But it's too late.

98
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:46,341
Don't worry, we'll make it.

99
00:10:47,826 --> 00:10:48,443
Let's go see a movie.

100
00:10:50,323 --> 00:10:53,877
Maybe we shouldn't have gone to see the room today.

101
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:54,948
Why?

102
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,127
It looks like another room will become available next month.

103
00:10:58,377 --> 00:11:01,393
He says it's a nice room.

104
00:11:01,612 --> 00:11:03,331
Why didn't you just say so?

105
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:07,368
I'm leaving.

106
00:11:25,845 --> 00:11:26,947
Tsuda!

107
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,900
There's an article about you in the paper.

108
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,556
Look at this.

109
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:52,869
Perpetrator ran into an amusement park to evade an unnecessary police chase.
and caused the unfortunate accident.

110
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:58,399
Therefore, some people are directing their anger at the cops, saying that the cops are responsible for going after the criminals too deep.

111
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:01,024
What's the hell?
That was necessary.

112
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:03,906
So this was you?
That's what I thought.

113
00:12:04,219 --> 00:12:04,672
Why?

114
00:12:04,719 --> 00:12:06,016
Because that's what you'd do.

115
00:12:06,273 --> 00:12:06,953
Don't say bullshit.

116
00:12:07,172 --> 00:12:10,297
If your name is written in the newspaper, you become famous.

117
00:12:15,662 --> 00:12:17,810
I definitely don't remember chasing anything.

118
00:12:19,459 --> 00:12:21,662
Well, that's all right.
If that's the case...

119
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:25,505
I can't just sit back and let them write this nonsense.

120
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:28,692
I'm going.

121
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:35,287
Strictly enforce the center line in the vicinity of Daini-Keihin Nakahara-kaido Road.

122
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:41,225
But Captain...
I did what I had to do at that time.

123
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:44,397
You're making a mistake too.

124
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:45,529
What?

125
00:12:46,584 --> 00:12:48,740
You didn't help the child and followed him.

126
00:12:48,912 --> 00:12:50,006
Don't get me wrong.

127
00:12:50,568 --> 00:12:53,725
I asked the police officer at the police box to do the job, and then I followed him.

128
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,326
Listen to everything I say.

129
00:12:57,436 --> 00:13:02,264
In that case, you need to get the kid to the hospital as soon as possible.

130
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:04,804
But I also had to call an ambulance right away.

131
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,398
With today's traffic, the ambulance may be late.

132
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:10,078
What do you do in that case?

133
00:13:11,804 --> 00:13:15,195
You're in charge

134
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:19,062
Saving lives comes before apprehending criminals.

135
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,453
 That's the motorcycle officer's code of conduct.

136
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:58,608
Driver's license

137
00:14:00,741 --> 00:14:02,327
Is something wrong?

138
00:14:28,496 --> 00:14:28,996
OK?

139
00:14:32,316 --> 00:14:38,526
He's getting better.
But the doctor says he needs to see the results of the X-ray again.

140
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,276
I see.

141
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,222
This is the fastest propeller shipboard plane.

142
00:14:46,626 --> 00:14:51,243
This is how it would be put together.
I bought it because it's fun.

143
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,626
This is the propeller that you put on an aircraft carrier.
The wings are supposed to fold like this.

144
00:14:55,907 --> 00:14:57,478
It's a propeller.
It really turns!

145
00:15:00,156 --> 00:15:04,351
This one fought with the Japanese Zero fighter.
Do you know which one won?

146
00:15:04,656 --> 00:15:05,796
Doctor will come.

147
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,269
How's it?

148
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:15,832
Get better soon.

149
00:15:20,338 --> 00:15:20,799
See you.

150
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:35,990
Oh here it is.

151
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:36,716
Yeah.

152
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:39,786
The Limits of Self-Defense in Criminal Investigation

153
00:15:40,794 --> 00:15:42,927
He still writes difficult things.

154
00:15:43,216 --> 00:15:45,372
He's very confident.

155
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:48,326
He said he was praised by everyone for being useful in investigations.

156
00:15:49,804 --> 00:15:55,984
I wonder if he thinks I have potential.
His fiancée seems to like him very much.

157
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,662
Who's the bride?

158
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,217
She is the younger sister of the Division 2 manager.

159
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:04,474
Her

160
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,355
She's nice.

161
00:16:09,964 --> 00:16:12,737
She's pretty and smart.
She'll make a great wife.

162
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:16,534
Takuya.
Don't get too interested in her.

163
00:16:16,995 --> 00:16:19,417
Don't say bullshit.
So he's gonna marry her?

164
00:16:20,034 --> 00:16:23,597
He looks so scared when I tell him about this.

165
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,237
Welcome back.

166
00:16:28,597 --> 00:16:29,222
Takuya is here.

167
00:16:29,378 --> 00:16:30,729
How are you?

168
00:16:31,386 --> 00:16:33,737
She looks nice.

169
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:36,448
You guys should get married soon too.

170
00:16:37,351 --> 00:16:37,976
He's mean.

171
00:16:38,001 --> 00:16:39,070
He's just shy.

172
00:16:40,101 --> 00:16:41,750
Serve him a beer.

173
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,367
I know.

174
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:48,357
I saw you in the newspaper.

175
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:50,216
I'm upset.

176
00:16:50,482 --> 00:16:51,903
I know how you feel.

177
00:16:52,586 --> 00:16:54,211
Is it likely that the culprit will be caught?

178
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:59,125
It's been a long time since the accident, but I don't have any clues.

179
00:16:59,943 --> 00:17:01,802
This will be cold case.

180
00:17:02,779 --> 00:17:04,615
The hit-and-run investigation team is very lazy.

181
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,308
But it's not that easy to investigate.

182
00:17:10,504 --> 00:17:12,355
What would you do if you were the head of a task force?

183
00:17:13,238 --> 00:17:16,363
It's none of my business.
I'm in charge of murder.

184
00:17:16,847 --> 00:17:19,816
It's same.
It's murder.

185
00:17:20,718 --> 00:17:22,421
Guys like that do it all the time.

186
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:27,030
You're not going to catch the killer yourself, are you?

187
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,582
Maybe you should leave it to a hit-and-run investigation.

188
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:41,660
You may think I'm deviating from my mission.
I just can't help myself if I don't catch him.

189
00:17:42,239 --> 00:17:45,817
you might cause problems.

190
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:50,534
You might use forceful means.

191
00:17:50,846 --> 00:17:52,112
I wouldn't do that.

192
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,526
There were three of them.
I'm thinking maybe he's part of a motorcycle gang.

193
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,811
So I'm thinking of casting a net around where they congregate.

194
00:18:03,491 --> 00:18:06,890
But I'm not too impressed.
It's like a kamikaze investigation or something.

195
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:10,163
Kamikaze or not.
I'll go all the way.

196
00:18:12,709 --> 00:18:15,841
You're always like this.
You're always so stingy with everything.

197
00:18:15,866 --> 00:18:18,311
Don't get me wrong.
He's wrong.

198
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:19,756
I’m not.

199
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm just asking for advice.

200
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,389
If you're not helping, I'm happy to help.

201
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:30,123
You?
I know it's not much, but it's better than nothing.

202
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:08,958
Sunday, December 6th
They're a group of guys working at a lumberyard in Koto-ku.

203
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,904
The man with the most brilliant steering wheel
Masahiro Takano.

204
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:18,576
The car he's driving
It's a skyliner, but he's small.

205
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:20,373
But I checked.

206
00:19:29,828 --> 00:19:30,867
Wait here.

207
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,408
They are members of the Tokyo Auto Club.

208
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,986
Company employee Koichi Kihara and Southeast University ITO SHU

209
00:19:44,682 --> 00:19:49,041
I don't think these members would be involved in a hit-and-run.

210
00:20:07,948 --> 00:20:11,253
Shibuya HARUO seems a little too young

211
00:20:14,878 --> 00:20:15,753
He looks like criminal.

212
00:20:22,783 --> 00:20:24,033
You're pretty good, aren't you?

213
00:20:27,963 --> 00:20:29,580
I'm surprised it's a woman.

214
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:45,174
Excuse me, can I borrow your fire?

215
00:20:46,088 --> 00:20:48,205
Nice bike.
It's a trial, isn't it?

216
00:20:48,486 --> 00:20:51,111
Yeah.
Take a drive.

217
00:20:52,822 --> 00:20:55,635
They were young men working at a U.S. military camp in Yokosuka, Japan.

218
00:20:55,994 --> 00:20:57,634
They look like the team.

219
00:20:58,385 --> 00:20:59,767
But they have alibi.

220
00:21:04,283 --> 00:21:06,587
I've been looking for him for a long time.

221
00:21:08,135 --> 00:21:10,814
I wonder if any of these people are the killer.

222
00:21:14,864 --> 00:21:17,418
Seems kind of pointless.

223
00:21:18,184 --> 00:21:19,848
I don't think there is a killer.

224
00:21:20,004 --> 00:21:21,528
I think he'll show up soon.

225
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:25,926
I'd like to go somewhere else for a change.
I'm bored.

226
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:27,895
We're not here for fun.

227
00:21:28,543 --> 00:21:32,145
It costs money to rent a car and come here.

228
00:21:35,131 --> 00:21:37,342
The room will be available.

229
00:21:37,576 --> 00:21:38,115
What?

230
00:21:39,303 --> 00:21:41,092
The apartment we're renting.

231
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:42,599
Oh yeah.

232
00:21:43,787 --> 00:21:46,154
We really have to go there this Sunday.

233
00:21:46,256 --> 00:21:46,717
OK.

234
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,390
You guys come here every Sunday.?

235
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:54,468
You guy's are bike crazy.

236
00:21:55,007 --> 00:21:55,984
You too.

237
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:56,796
Yeah.

238
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,538
You wanna drive long?

239
00:21:59,984 --> 00:22:00,570
To where?

240
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,070
Hamamatsu
It's this coming Saturday.

241
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:05,888
There's a club called Tsubame Auto Club.
They're hosting this event.

242
00:22:06,295 --> 00:22:09,748
The membership fee is 3,000 yen, they take the car home, and they pay for the gas.

243
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:10,990
Wanna join?

244
00:22:12,342 --> 00:22:14,818
Sounds like fun. Anyone can join?

245
00:22:15,138 --> 00:22:18,224
Yeah.
You wanna come too?

246
00:22:18,763 --> 00:22:20,537
Maybe we can find some clue.

247
00:22:21,904 --> 00:22:24,185
I'll give it a shot.

248
00:22:28,236 --> 00:22:29,673
They want to come.

249
00:22:30,986 --> 00:22:32,118
Hello.

250
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,618
I'm Yazawa from Tsubame Auto Club.

251
00:22:38,406 --> 00:22:39,890
Hirai and Tajima.

252
00:22:41,914 --> 00:22:42,859
I'm Machida.

253
00:22:44,585 --> 00:22:46,164
She's my girlfriend,Ito.

254
00:22:47,671 --> 00:22:49,117
Are you a confident driver?

255
00:22:50,647 --> 00:22:51,882
A little bit.

256
00:22:52,429 --> 00:22:54,890
It's okay, I'm the one who recruited him.

257
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,640
It's a long day for recreation.

258
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:03,085
I'm looking for someone who's good at it. I don't want him to fall off halfway through.

259
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:03,898
Here.

260
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,375
What's your job?

261
00:23:06,999 --> 00:23:08,476
Factory in Izasuko.

262
00:23:09,281 --> 00:23:11,210
Where did you learn to drive?

263
00:23:11,382 --> 00:23:12,390
Use Factory car.

264
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,093
You're good.

265
00:23:14,187 --> 00:23:15,484
Wanna dance?

266
00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:35,080
Wanna dance?

267
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,339
Why would you meet someone like that?

268
00:23:51,284 --> 00:23:51,878
It's ok.

269
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:53,245
Do you think they are suspicious?

270
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:54,198
I don't know.

271
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,503
I don't like them.

272
00:23:55,902 --> 00:23:58,347
i need some clue.

273
00:23:58,402 --> 00:23:59,925
I don't think it's worth it.

274
00:24:02,331 --> 00:24:04,355
By the way, did your brother say something?

275
00:24:06,749 --> 00:24:09,546
He's really mad at me for being your assistant.

276
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,678
He said you're both crazy.

277
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:15,022
I know.. I mean some clue..

278
00:24:15,882 --> 00:24:17,780
Does he talk like that?

279
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:19,600
Oh yeah.

280
00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:23,374
But here's what he said.

281
00:24:24,788 --> 00:24:26,077
He thought he was a pro.

282
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:27,092
pro?

283
00:24:28,663 --> 00:24:30,647
A professional hit-and-run driver.

284
00:24:33,132 --> 00:24:33,374
pro?

285
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:37,171
Yes, a professional rider.

286
00:24:38,359 --> 00:24:39,773
Oh yeah
He was very good at that.

287
00:24:53,323 --> 00:24:54,229
I'm back.

288
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:06,917
Would you be willing to provide security support for members of the Diet at Haneda Airport?

289
00:25:07,386 --> 00:25:08,081
Today?

290
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:09,784
I'm sorry.

291
00:25:10,456 --> 00:25:11,909
I have plans today..

292
00:25:12,604 --> 00:25:13,683
Please.

293
00:25:15,925 --> 00:25:19,573
I've got relatives coming out of the country.
I have to pick them up at 2:00.

294
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,901
Well, there's nothing I can do.

295
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,362
What's wrong?

296
00:25:36,604 --> 00:25:37,393
We can't go.

297
00:25:37,807 --> 00:25:38,260
Why?

298
00:25:38,557 --> 00:25:39,878
our plans have changed.

299
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,354
Hamamatsu is in trouble.

300
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:47,924
Listen up everyone!
I'm very sorry about what happened.

301
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,487
our plans have changed.

302
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:54,409
We couldn't rent bikes today.

303
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:58,534
Of course, I complained, but there's no more bikes left.

304
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:04,386
I'm sorry, but we're going to have to postpone today's ride.

305
00:26:08,871 --> 00:26:09,589
That's strange.

306
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:11,191
He's making fun of us.

307
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:13,660
Don't you think they are strange?

308
00:26:13,996 --> 00:26:15,371
It's a bit sloppy.

309
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:19,601
but i don't think they are the culprits.

310
00:26:19,626 --> 00:26:20,148
Why?

311
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:24,820
It's not a threesome.
That woman is always attached to them.

312
00:26:25,701 --> 00:26:28,006
I can't help it.
I'll go back to the tech and look for it.

313
00:26:28,436 --> 00:26:30,381
You're not going to find him there.

314
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:34,553
Hit-and-run drivers don't always go there.

315
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,055
What's wrong with you?

316
00:26:43,688 --> 00:26:44,235
Hold on.

317
00:26:47,617 --> 00:26:49,414
I'm sorry to hear that.
I was looking forward to it.

318
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:51,625
Next chance.

319
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:54,313
Why don't you come out and play somewhere?

320
00:26:54,836 --> 00:26:56,078
There's Oi Auto race.

321
00:26:56,711 --> 00:26:57,821
Shall we go there?

322
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:19,129
I won!

323
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,598
I won too.

324
00:27:28,638 --> 00:27:29,388
What should I drink?

325
00:27:29,497 --> 00:27:30,935
I want coke.

326
00:27:33,864 --> 00:27:35,654
Oh, that's unusual, isn't it?
I can't believe we're meeting like this.

327
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:37,615
How's your gambling?

328
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,709
That's bad.
There are no good racers like you in the races, so I can't make any money.

329
00:27:42,241 --> 00:27:43,530
What do you think?

330
00:27:46,686 --> 00:27:47,827
You hate me.

331
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,210
This and this.
Buy it.

332
00:27:51,374 --> 00:27:51,858
OK.

333
00:27:59,715 --> 00:28:01,035
What did you buy?

334
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:02,559
2-4

335
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:04,317
I think it's good.

336
00:28:05,629 --> 00:28:08,918
The woman you are always with is your lover?

337
00:28:10,242 --> 00:28:11,421
Why you ask for that?

338
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,085
By the way, was Mr. Yazawa a motorcyclist?

339
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:20,156
He used to be famous.

340
00:28:24,712 --> 00:28:25,798
I know you work .

341
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:26,798
Yes

342
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:27,579
Where?

343
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:30,345
At a record store.

344
00:28:30,688 --> 00:28:34,259
Interesting place.
I like mono-jazz, too.

345
00:28:35,694 --> 00:28:36,648
I'll go buy some next time.

346
00:28:39,491 --> 00:28:41,780
You have a nice figure.

347
00:28:42,312 --> 00:28:44,226
Wanna hang around with me too?

348
00:28:46,421 --> 00:28:47,140
You don't like it?

349
00:28:53,327 --> 00:28:55,421
She's pure.

350
00:29:00,982 --> 00:29:03,607
Where the hell have you been?
I'm leaving.

351
00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:04,357
Wait.

352
00:29:15,898 --> 00:29:17,023
welcome!

353
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:18,371
welcome!

354
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:19,442
Thanks for the other day.

355
00:29:19,556 --> 00:29:20,569
Water?

356
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,266
Yes

357
00:29:21,313 --> 00:29:22,133
One Water

358
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,143
You look not good.

359
00:29:24,582 --> 00:29:26,915
I lost last time in Oi.

360
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:29,236
You'd better drive bike for a change.

361
00:29:30,156 --> 00:29:35,169
I thought auto racers were good at it, but it's not that big of a deal.

362
00:29:35,393 --> 00:29:35,753
What?

363
00:29:36,043 --> 00:29:40,037
I watched the race and got mad at their driving skills.

364
00:29:40,531 --> 00:29:42,078
It's not easy.

365
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,333
Really?
I don't trust you.

366
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:48,212
They are not professional but just rider.

367
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,287
You have a big mouth.

368
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:53,353
I'm, you know, I'm not good at everything else, but I'm pretty good at driving.

369
00:29:53,683 --> 00:29:55,763
I saw his skill.
He's very good.

370
00:29:55,963 --> 00:29:57,016
Why you are his side?

371
00:29:57,257 --> 00:29:59,564
I'm the one who scouted him.

372
00:30:00,441 --> 00:30:03,208
You're going pro, you're going to be popular.
because you're cool

373
00:30:03,538 --> 00:30:05,532
That’s funny.

374
00:30:08,425 --> 00:30:11,272
Stop badmouthing them.

375
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:12,392
Why?

376
00:30:13,046 --> 00:30:15,100
He used to be Pro.

377
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:18,188
Sorry I didn't know.

378
00:30:18,927 --> 00:30:19,987
I know you are much better.

379
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,664
Let me show you what a pro looks like.

380
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,054
I'm afraid.

381
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,960
Come on.
I'll show you.

382
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:44,779
What kind of game are we playing?

383
00:30:46,393 --> 00:30:49,500
If we run into them from here on out, we'll hit a boat and definitely crash.

384
00:30:50,984 --> 00:30:54,717
We'll start out all the way over there.
From there, we're going to hit us at a hundred kilometers an hour.

385
00:30:55,694 --> 00:30:58,560
Remember?
100km excactly.

386
00:31:00,705 --> 00:31:04,485
This is when you do the spin turn and stop.

387
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:08,218
We'll see who can go as far as they can, and we'll compare them.

388
00:31:12,069 --> 00:31:13,203
It's a thrill.

389
00:31:13,983 --> 00:31:15,489
I'll show you how the pros do it.

390
00:31:18,741 --> 00:31:19,668
Are you coward?

391
00:31:20,941 --> 00:31:22,175
Don't be afraid.

392
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:24,648
It's ok if you run away.

393
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:28,765
I will do it.

394
00:31:29,652 --> 00:31:30,478
You got some balls.

395
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,542
Remember?
100km excactly.

396
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:44,626
Let's start.

397
00:32:03,365 --> 00:32:05,772
I'm lost.
You are great.

398
00:32:06,853 --> 00:32:09,133
You got some balls.
You made it.

399
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:20,202
He's play boy.

400
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,981
We can use him.

401
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:25,164
You want him to join us?

402
00:32:25,517 --> 00:32:27,810
No way.
I doubt him.

403
00:32:27,917 --> 00:32:28,517
For what?

404
00:32:29,516 --> 00:32:31,296
He acts strange.

405
00:32:31,613 --> 00:32:32,466
You think he's police?

406
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,477
Yeah.
He's too good for us.

407
00:32:35,614 --> 00:32:36,527
You think he's police?

408
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,962
I think so.
Boss is too kind.

409
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:51,160
I'll go out with him and see how he is.

410
00:32:52,257 --> 00:32:54,050
I'll find out if he's police or not.

411
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:59,750
By the way...your outfit was so nice.

412
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,975
I rent the outfit.

413
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:08,185
See you.

414
00:33:08,432 --> 00:33:09,245
See you.

415
00:33:09,765 --> 00:33:10,425
I'll send you home.

416
00:33:10,538 --> 00:33:11,252
No thanks.

417
00:33:11,429 --> 00:33:12,629
Don't be hesitate.

418
00:33:12,669 --> 00:33:13,356
I feel sorry.

419
00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:14,416
Don't be hesitate.

420
00:33:14,824 --> 00:33:15,984
You can go with him.

421
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,320
Where do you live?

422
00:33:20,587 --> 00:33:21,180
Meguro.

423
00:33:23,689 --> 00:33:25,029
See you.

424
00:33:34,253 --> 00:33:35,619
Here's fine.

425
00:33:35,644 --> 00:33:36,453
Don't be hesitate.

426
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,213
It's far from your home.

427
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:39,612
Never mind.

428
00:33:40,305 --> 00:33:41,211
Here's fine.

429
00:33:42,025 --> 00:33:42,925
Never mind.

430
00:33:44,383 --> 00:33:45,690
Here's fine.

431
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:47,590
I'll send you home.

432
00:33:49,447 --> 00:33:50,707
Hold on.

433
00:33:50,827 --> 00:33:51,374
What?

434
00:33:51,454 --> 00:33:52,234
Stop here

435
00:33:52,626 --> 00:33:53,120
Why?

436
00:33:53,313 --> 00:33:54,460
I'm hungry.

437
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:55,294
I'll treat you

438
00:33:55,768 --> 00:33:56,561
Noodle.

439
00:33:59,625 --> 00:34:01,365
You told me you worked at factory.

440
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:04,657
Where?

441
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,855
Akebono print in Sinagawa

442
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,153
How long are you working there?

443
00:34:10,553 --> 00:34:11,787
About 5 years.

444
00:34:12,713 --> 00:34:13,793
Good paid?

445
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:16,253
It's not a lot.

446
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:21,196
What kind printing?

447
00:34:21,842 --> 00:34:23,642
It's just a pamphlet.

448
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:28,360
We are small factory.
Manager told me there were a lot of Labor costs.

449
00:34:32,047 --> 00:34:32,740
How much?

450
00:34:32,994 --> 00:34:33,740
I'll pay.

451
00:34:33,765 --> 00:34:34,307
Don't worry.

452
00:34:34,934 --> 00:34:35,814
That'll be 100 yen.

453
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,063
Thank you very much.

454
00:34:42,176 --> 00:34:43,243
I'll drive this time.

455
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:46,003
Thank you very much.

456
00:34:52,694 --> 00:34:54,287
You drive too fast.

457
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,501
Hold me tight.

458
00:34:56,811 --> 00:34:58,757
This is good though
It's a speeding violation

459
00:34:58,857 --> 00:34:59,911
Don't worry.

460
00:35:02,057 --> 00:35:03,297
Are you ok?

461
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:10,697
Are you ok?

462
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:14,403
That's what I told you.

463
00:35:24,639 --> 00:35:26,279
Speed over 100km.

464
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:27,265
My bad

465
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:28,043
License.

466
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:29,995
My bad

467
00:35:30,668 --> 00:35:31,222
No license?

468
00:35:31,452 --> 00:35:32,592
It's at my house.

469
00:35:33,398 --> 00:35:34,472
Why don't you get off?

470
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,271
Don't you think you're in violation?

471
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:43,775
I told you I was sorry.

472
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,622
Stop it.

473
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,435
Never mind.

474
00:35:45,808 --> 00:35:46,482
Come.

475
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:50,094
Wait!

476
00:35:59,948 --> 00:36:00,828
Come to the police.

477
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,997
Police 36 team here

478
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:19,708
Ok what's wrong?

479
00:36:20,185 --> 00:36:22,738
I'm taking the speeder to the police.

480
00:36:23,624 --> 00:36:24,657
we get it.

481
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:28,988
Actually I'm police.

482
00:36:33,471 --> 00:36:37,551
We received a report from the Head Police this morning that what you did was clearly overzealous.

483
00:36:38,403 --> 00:36:43,710
But given the circumstances of the hit-and-run, I couldn't resist.

484
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:46,913
You don't trust the task force?

485
00:36:48,035 --> 00:36:49,835
But, boss..

486
00:36:50,405 --> 00:36:51,705
I saw the man who did it.

487
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,754
I couldn't see his face, but...
I still have a distinct impression of the man.

488
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:58,035
I don't mean that it is not your business.

489
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:04,662
I'm just saying... you can't go around breaking traffic laws...
I mean, even if it was an act, it's still... it's still overkill.

490
00:37:05,205 --> 00:37:07,965
It's a deviation from the call of duty.
Don't you think?

491
00:37:10,974 --> 00:37:12,988
I've never seen a man behave as recklessly as you have.

492
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,549
You have to manage him.

493
00:37:18,608 --> 00:37:19,208
Listen.

494
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,338
Now, this would normally be a matter of your resignation, of course.

495
00:37:24,548 --> 00:37:25,862
If this gets out...

496
00:37:26,712 --> 00:37:30,239
This becomes a problem for the whole department.

497
00:37:31,871 --> 00:37:34,678
I'll stop you right where you are.

498
00:37:35,646 --> 00:37:36,992
Don't do this again,ok?

499
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:39,456
You too.

500
00:37:42,748 --> 00:37:43,861
Write here.

501
00:37:45,778 --> 00:37:46,771
What's this?

502
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:48,198
Write here.

503
00:37:50,992 --> 00:37:51,879
Pledge of Allegiance

504
00:37:53,195 --> 00:37:59,402
I will henceforth perform my duties under the command of my company commander and squad leader.

505
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:02,666
I will henceforth perform my duties

506
00:38:04,428 --> 00:38:07,488
I will never deviate from my duties.

507
00:38:08,734 --> 00:38:12,227
I need you to write this down so I can stop you.

508
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:16,063
But I don't think I pulled that kind of bullshit.

509
00:38:16,309 --> 00:38:18,889
Your actions alone are destroying the discipline of this police force.

510
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:19,820
But

511
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:20,693
Write it.

512
00:38:22,016 --> 00:38:23,662
write down the date of your signature.

513
00:38:33,327 --> 00:38:36,214
If the section chief said that much to me.
I'd lose all respect for our department.

514
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,120
Can't you at least be a little bit aware of that?

515
00:38:40,605 --> 00:38:41,525
addressed to me.

516
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,441
Just in case you need this pledge for your own good.

517
00:38:53,536 --> 00:38:53,969
All right.

518
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:57,453
Go.

519
00:39:04,155 --> 00:39:05,142
He got angry with you?

520
00:39:06,408 --> 00:39:08,268
He's stubborn.

521
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:11,437
Hey,Mizuno?

522
00:39:12,162 --> 00:39:16,155
Hey, let's reconfigure the team today.
You'll be working with Yamashita.

523
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:19,297
Tsuda's needed with me for the time being.

524
00:39:27,037 --> 00:39:28,130
I'll take 800 yen.

525
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:40,031
You look upset.

526
00:39:40,353 --> 00:39:41,466
Nothing.

527
00:39:42,201 --> 00:39:43,514
You are not in good mood.

528
00:39:45,747 --> 00:39:47,107
Thank you very much.

529
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,540
Do you have Latin chorus?

530
00:39:54,814 --> 00:39:55,927
You must be tired.

531
00:39:56,565 --> 00:40:01,031
Forget about those weirdos.
Why don't you take it easy this Sunday?

532
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:02,452
I can't.

533
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:03,599
Why?

534
00:40:04,326 --> 00:40:08,320
The captain told me I had to work a special shift next Sunday too.

535
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,141
He's stopping you.

536
00:40:12,166 --> 00:40:13,425
It's not funny.

537
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:14,458
Thank you very much.

538
00:40:14,483 --> 00:40:15,811
Thank you very much.

539
00:40:16,301 --> 00:40:22,001
Can you do me a favor?
Can you get close to YAZAWA for me?

540
00:40:22,618 --> 00:40:24,698
No I don't want.

541
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:27,303
I worry what he will do to me.

542
00:40:27,511 --> 00:40:29,045
Just call him ok.

543
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:32,344
The phone number of the BAR the other day.

544
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,472
If he ask for me, you'll try to be nice about it.

545
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,012
Welcome.

546
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,534
My fake name is Machida.

547
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,174
I know and you are  printer.

548
00:41:00,718 --> 00:41:01,431
Job for me?

549
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:05,001
We'll go to Osaka but not Hamamatsu.

550
00:41:05,371 --> 00:41:05,971
Osaka?

551
00:41:06,298 --> 00:41:07,118
It's far.

552
00:41:07,478 --> 00:41:09,698
You know there's a clunker shop in Nishinari called Sudo Introductions?

553
00:41:11,547 --> 00:41:14,814
I've already contacted the president.
The total price is 170000 yen.

554
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:17,604
Fifteen cars?

555
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,548
Yes, 5 foreign cars included.

556
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,158
Isn't that cheap?

557
00:41:22,127 --> 00:41:25,400
Don't say anything you don't have to.
You couriers can shut your mouths and carry on.

558
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,233
Be careful with the crowd.

559
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:30,866
Leave it to me!

560
00:41:33,141 --> 00:41:35,068
Only 3 available.

561
00:41:35,388 --> 00:41:36,074
Only 3?

562
00:41:36,409 --> 00:41:39,043
It was too urgent.

563
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:40,156
It can't be helped.

564
00:41:40,486 --> 00:41:42,172
Use the tech to gather them up again.

565
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:43,546
How about bringing Machida?

566
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:50,383
Don't worry. I saw he was arrested. I'm sure he's not police.

567
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:52,636
How about calling his factory to check his identify?

568
00:42:01,329 --> 00:42:02,696
Hello? This is Akebono print.

569
00:42:03,713 --> 00:42:07,105
Is there a person called Machida?

570
00:42:07,813 --> 00:42:08,987
Factory worker

571
00:42:09,673 --> 00:42:12,400
Yes, he is. but he went home today.

572
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:14,246
He went home today.

573
00:42:17,074 --> 00:42:20,374
Can you tell me his address?

574
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:23,506
It's urgent business.

575
00:42:23,952 --> 00:42:25,606
He's good at riding.

576
00:42:26,198 --> 00:42:27,558
Especially spin turn.

577
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:29,018
What's that?

578
00:42:29,671 --> 00:42:32,551
To come barreling in and brake suddenly and at the same time dig a hole and go around.

579
00:42:33,768 --> 00:42:35,954
This is very high skill.

580
00:42:36,308 --> 00:42:37,068
Beer.

581
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,846
I bet Yazawa is the killer.

582
00:42:44,844 --> 00:42:49,497
You told me the killer was pros but Yazawa was pro-rider.

583
00:42:50,396 --> 00:42:51,909
What do you want to ask me?

584
00:42:52,153 --> 00:42:56,413
That's why YAZAWA has no decisive power to arrest you even if he knows you're suspicious.

585
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:57,809
What should I do in a case like this?

586
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,544
How would I know?

587
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:03,684
You're the expert.
There's got to be something you can do.

588
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,083
Don't do that. That's a job for the task force.Don't do that. That's a job for the task force.

589
00:43:08,472 --> 00:43:12,026
YAZAWA was a professional. The task force didn't know that.

590
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:14,675
But it's not your territory.

591
00:43:15,417 --> 00:43:21,433
You act like my boss.
I don't think it's right that the police have jurisdiction.

592
00:43:21,878 --> 00:43:23,651
That's why there are so many hit-and-runs.

593
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:25,167
Anyway have a drink.

594
00:43:25,526 --> 00:43:28,386
Look, you and me, we're gonna be brothers one of these days.

595
00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:31,472
you are unreliable as a brother.

596
00:43:31,573 --> 00:43:34,972
I don't want to have an angry younger brother like you.

597
00:43:34,997 --> 00:43:37,237
I'll never ask for help again.

598
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,362
Oh you are here.

599
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:41,159
What's wrong?

600
00:43:41,184 --> 00:43:42,706
I'm hungry.

601
00:43:43,433 --> 00:43:45,183
i will introduce her to you.
She's Keiko.

602
00:43:45,378 --> 00:43:46,815
You saw her photo some day.

603
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,323
Nice to meet you.
I'm Tsuda.

604
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:51,956
You should leave

605
00:43:53,026 --> 00:43:53,894
Please have a seat.

606
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:55,339
Don't worry.

607
00:43:55,628 --> 00:43:57,815
We'll sit there.

608
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,704
Let's have a meal.

609
00:44:01,729 --> 00:44:03,970
My bros will pay for it.

610
00:44:04,923 --> 00:44:06,236
One Geso.

611
00:44:07,681 --> 00:44:09,025
I want Toro.

612
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:12,593
Is Mr. Machida here?

613
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:14,398
Who are you?

614
00:44:15,414 --> 00:44:16,476
I'm Kajima.

615
00:44:18,078 --> 00:44:20,109
You have a visitor.
Kajima.

616
00:44:20,601 --> 00:44:21,132
Kajima?

617
00:44:21,484 --> 00:44:22,335
Auto bike club's

618
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,226
I don't know him.
I guess Tsuda's visitor.

619
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:35,816
What can I do for you?

620
00:44:36,207 --> 00:44:37,512
I wanna see Machida.

621
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,191
Did you talk him about me?

622
00:45:12,972 --> 00:45:17,160
It can't be helped.
Treat me.

623
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:24,778
You're bad.You're a cop and you use my name.
You didn't tell me that up front.

624
00:45:24,825 --> 00:45:25,817
i thank you.

625
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:27,833
I'll use your name next time.

626
00:45:27,858 --> 00:45:29,200
I see.
I see.

627
00:45:29,349 --> 00:45:30,075
Why he came here?

628
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:32,138
He told me to go to Osaka next Sunday.

629
00:45:32,247 --> 00:45:32,638
Osaka?

630
00:45:36,771 --> 00:45:38,419
Last time I was here, there was a checkpoint.

631
00:45:38,599 --> 00:45:41,208
Turn right from Shizuoka.

632
00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:43,630
Take this road to the north.

633
00:45:44,028 --> 00:45:44,958
To The mountain?

634
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:51,817
There's a path that takes you upstream of the creek here and out of the valley once here.

635
00:45:52,192 --> 00:45:52,981
Have you passed there before?

636
00:45:53,006 --> 00:45:53,911
Yes from Nagoya.

637
00:45:54,388 --> 00:45:57,325
I once came back from Nagoya to Shizuoka in three hours.

638
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,099
It's a little tough, but it's the safest.

639
00:46:41,058 --> 00:46:42,198
You have a visitor.

640
00:46:42,776 --> 00:46:43,472
I see.

641
00:46:44,456 --> 00:46:44,980
What's wrong?

642
00:46:46,237 --> 00:46:47,284
I wonder if you have a tea.

643
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:48,597
I have many. thanks.

644
00:46:49,003 --> 00:46:49,925
Welcome back.

645
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:51,550
What's wrong?

646
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,112
Are you going to Osaka tomorrow?

647
00:46:53,137 --> 00:46:54,347
I got holiday.

648
00:46:54,472 --> 00:46:55,597
Take me there.

649
00:46:55,948 --> 00:46:56,855
You shouldn't go.

650
00:46:57,284 --> 00:46:57,956
Why?

651
00:46:57,987 --> 00:46:59,214
I think you're going to be dangerous.

652
00:47:01,128 --> 00:47:05,378
I had a fight with my brother.
It was for your sake.

653
00:47:06,934 --> 00:47:08,895
He doesn't want you to go to Osaka.

654
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:10,161
I see.

655
00:47:10,856 --> 00:47:14,309
He wanted me to go stop you, but I didn't want to.
I didn't want to, so we fought.

656
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,825
My brother says there's no medicine for stupidity.

657
00:47:19,966 --> 00:47:21,544
Take me there.

658
00:47:23,645 --> 00:47:24,254
I can't.

659
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:27,826
I have a feeling we're going to catch the killer this time.

660
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:32,225
So it's really dangerous for me to take you with me.

661
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:37,873
Okay, then.
But I'm not going home tonight.

662
00:47:40,496 --> 00:47:42,089
I'm gonna give my brother a little trouble.

663
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,027
Where are you going to stay?

664
00:47:46,582 --> 00:47:47,691
I'm staying here.

665
00:47:48,457 --> 00:47:49,464
What's the hell?

666
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:01,545
You should go home.

667
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:02,732
No

668
00:48:03,686 --> 00:48:04,568
I'll send you.

669
00:48:06,381 --> 00:48:07,303
I'm never leaving.

670
00:48:08,451 --> 00:48:11,068
If you don't let me stay here.
I'm going away.

671
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:13,592
Hi

672
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:14,904
Hi

673
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:16,936
Hello?

674
00:48:18,397 --> 00:48:18,842
What's wrong?

675
00:48:19,014 --> 00:48:20,725
The other day, the important one...

676
00:48:23,217 --> 00:48:24,217
What are you talking about?

677
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,147
Please hit the accelerator.

678
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:33,369
He's stupid.

679
00:48:35,369 --> 00:48:38,541
you are very stubborn.
You are like your bros.

680
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:44,135
It's so annoying that I'm staying here?

681
00:48:45,111 --> 00:48:47,807
I don't mean that.

682
00:48:49,791 --> 00:48:52,049
Don't worry, I'll go home.

683
00:49:05,724 --> 00:49:07,740
I'm kind of worried about me tomorrow.

684
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:09,919
I'll be fine.

685
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:15,130
Because if the real killer shows up.
If the real killer shows up, you'll be in deep trouble.

686
00:49:18,277 --> 00:49:20,933
And you don't even know how you're going to get to Osaka.

687
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:23,074
Are you sure you're okay?

688
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:25,957
Suddenly you're talking about something that worries me.

689
00:49:27,979 --> 00:49:30,447
I don't want you to take any danger.

690
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:43,690
I wonder how that boy's surgery is going.

691
00:49:44,627 --> 00:49:46,307
I'd feel bad if he got a bad leg or something.

692
00:49:49,479 --> 00:49:53,104
I've never said this before.

693
00:49:54,807 --> 00:49:58,143
I have a feeling I'm partly to blame for what happened.

694
00:49:58,846 --> 00:49:59,589
Why?

695
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:02,010
I chased him too much.

696
00:50:03,010 --> 00:50:06,924
You were so angry when it was written in the paper.

697
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:10,268
Opinions from a third party can be more accurate than you think.

698
00:50:11,104 --> 00:50:13,292
You were right then, weren't you?

699
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:17,268
Of course I was.

700
00:50:18,073 --> 00:50:20,018
Be confidence.

701
00:50:20,745 --> 00:50:22,534
That's not so you.

702
00:50:23,643 --> 00:50:26,893
I feel responsible for that boy.

703
00:50:27,354 --> 00:50:27,964
Responsible ?

704
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:30,323
I'm sorry for what I did to him.

705
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:33,229
That's why I'm gonna do what I have to do.

706
00:50:35,823 --> 00:50:38,495
Are you serious about solving this case?

707
00:50:43,912 --> 00:50:44,615
Good luck.

708
00:50:45,904 --> 00:50:47,107
Be careful.

709
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:15,949
I knew you'd go for it.

710
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:20,506
Is he really suspicious?

711
00:51:21,076 --> 00:51:22,748
I think I'm onto something today.

712
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:27,935
Okay.
But if you're so sure, why don't you report it to the hit-and-run unit?

713
00:51:29,209 --> 00:51:31,209
That's the only way they'll understand your enthusiasm.

714
00:51:32,170 --> 00:51:39,357
After the other night's debacle.Try any more of your deviant behavior.
You'll lose all credibility as a human being, not to mention a cop.

715
00:51:39,537 --> 00:51:42,084
You came here to stop me?
Then leave.

716
00:51:42,709 --> 00:51:45,467
You want to take credit?

717
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:48,045
Don't say bullshit.

718
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,303
You're gonna get hurt.
What are you going to do?

719
00:51:51,537 --> 00:51:56,474
You don't know that because you've never cracked a killer.
A killer is like a wounded beast.

720
00:51:57,209 --> 00:52:01,435
When they get cracked, they'll bite down on you like a rabid dog.
It's a more dangerous job than you think.

721
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:04,896
I get it.

722
00:52:05,326 --> 00:52:07,842
Come with me to the police and file a report.

723
00:52:09,115 --> 00:52:09,818
Leave it here

724
00:52:09,959 --> 00:52:12,256
I know.
I'm going to police, so don't worry.

725
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:14,467
You go there first.

726
00:52:14,763 --> 00:52:16,443
I know you'll go to Osaka.

727
00:52:21,364 --> 00:52:22,763
You don't know what I'm talking about?

728
00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:27,146
Let me go.

729
00:52:29,087 --> 00:52:32,040
I want to catch the guy who did this to the kid who got hurt.

730
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:40,173
I may be trying to do more than I can.
But I'm going to do this one thing, and I don't care if it gets me fired.

731
00:52:44,215 --> 00:52:45,019
I understand.

732
00:52:50,316 --> 00:52:56,098
But I'm warning you.If I find out they're guilty...
Don't try to arrest them on the spot.

733
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:57,074
Why?

734
00:52:57,519 --> 00:53:00,269
They have mates.
That's the most dangerous.

735
00:53:01,535 --> 00:53:04,059
If you're in a hurry at the critical moment, you'll lose everything.

736
00:53:05,027 --> 00:53:08,136
Never take your police book or handcuffs with you.

737
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:13,277
If they find you, all your hard work will be for nothing.

738
00:53:15,752 --> 00:53:16,534
I get it.

739
00:53:18,377 --> 00:53:19,534
Take care

740
00:53:25,026 --> 00:53:25,885
It's a foreign bike.

741
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,542
New bike cost close to a million yen each.

742
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:32,909
BSA,BMW,Harley-Davidson

743
00:53:35,277 --> 00:53:37,824
It's strange that such a high-end bike is available at a rental bike shop.

744
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,215
Attention.

745
00:53:44,629 --> 00:53:52,621
We are about to leave, but...
As I've asked you many times before, please do not drive erratically.

746
00:53:53,684 --> 00:53:58,199
I've outlined the course, but we'll be leading the way.

747
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:02,816
There will be many ups and downs, but we will lead the way.
So please hang in there.

748
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,637
So Let's go.
Safe drive.

749
00:54:52,573 --> 00:54:53,886
You are a woman, please avoid traffic violations.

750
00:54:54,136 --> 00:54:54,823
I’m sorry.

751
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:56,807
License.

752
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:11,698
You do have a driver's license, right?
Please drive according to traffic rules

753
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:56,888
What's wrong?

754
00:55:57,208 --> 00:55:58,927
My motorcycle is acting up.

755
00:55:59,513 --> 00:56:00,630
What's wrong with it?

756
00:56:01,208 --> 00:56:03,786
The carburetor here, it's just not right.

757
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:08,763
This is strange.

758
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:11,528
The body and engine have been reassembled.

759
00:56:13,427 --> 00:56:15,247
This one uses a different year, doesn't it?

760
00:56:18,927 --> 00:56:19,974
Mine is same.

761
00:56:21,052 --> 00:56:22,536
It's been repainted so I won't notice.

762
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:30,468
Have you ever participated this event before?

763
00:56:30,703 --> 00:56:32,281
No, this is my first time.

764
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,071
It's a beautiful day.

765
00:56:38,930 --> 00:56:40,789
Have you ever participated this event before?

766
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:42,641
That's the third time.

767
00:56:43,461 --> 00:56:44,289
Where did you go last time?

768
00:56:44,696 --> 00:56:45,461
Nagoya.

769
00:56:47,024 --> 00:56:47,765
and before that?

770
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:48,782
Osaka.

771
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:52,633
What kind of hotel did you stay at?

772
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:54,282
It's a hotel that costs about the same as the membership fee.

773
00:56:55,877 --> 00:57:00,330
But... of the 3,000 yen membership fee...
1,000 yen for lodging.

774
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:05,423
The other 2,000 yen is for gas, lunch and car rental.
That's a little low, isn't it?

775
00:57:06,221 --> 00:57:09,260
Some people object to the price.

776
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:19,760
When We went to Nagoya, We just drove straight on the national highway.

777
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:22,728
It was nice, but the return trip was not.

778
00:57:23,213 --> 00:57:24,392
Did you take a different road on the way back?

779
00:57:24,447 --> 00:57:26,306
The motorcycle I used on the way home was very old.

780
00:57:28,174 --> 00:57:29,783
Do you use a different motorcycle when you go home?

781
00:57:30,291 --> 00:57:31,978
On the way back, I used a rental bike in Nagoya.

782
00:57:32,588 --> 00:57:33,564
Nagoya's?

783
00:57:35,619 --> 00:57:36,791
What will happen to the motorcycle I rode here?

784
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,455
I wonder if they should do some maintenance or something.

785
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:39,392
Maintenance?

786
00:57:40,221 --> 00:57:43,517
The license plate number on the way back was from Aichi Prefecture.

787
00:57:44,596 --> 00:57:48,088
That's strange... a different motorcycle on the way there and back.

788
00:57:49,377 --> 00:57:50,596
I'm sure it's something...

789
00:58:28,427 --> 00:58:31,724
Are you ready for gas?

790
00:58:33,731 --> 00:58:34,637
Let's go!

791
00:59:41,895 --> 00:59:43,645
Hey, you okay?

792
00:59:43,989 --> 00:59:45,622
Help him.

793
00:59:45,647 --> 00:59:46,989
You okay?

794
00:59:47,372 --> 00:59:49,551
You have to ride carefully.

795
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,130
This is rental bike.

796
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,114
Looks like he hurt his leg.

797
00:59:53,145 --> 00:59:54,489
I can't help it.

798
00:59:55,083 --> 00:59:57,051
You guys go first.

799
00:59:57,481 --> 00:59:59,012
Don't go too fast.

800
00:59:59,145 --> 01:00:01,098
Don't worry.
I can drive.

801
01:00:01,123 --> 01:00:02,364
Don't push yourself too hard.

802
01:00:02,723 --> 01:00:04,426
motorcycle broke.
You stupid.

803
01:00:04,770 --> 01:00:07,645
There's no point in getting angry.
We have to take him to the hospital.

804
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,341
Take him to your bike.

805
01:00:09,442 --> 01:00:10,098
what to do with his bike?

806
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:10,934
Do it.

807
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:12,145
You know how to go?

808
01:01:05,861 --> 01:01:06,963
You okay?

809
01:01:07,338 --> 01:01:09,384
There was something wrong with the plug, but it has been fixed.

810
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:29,644
Let's have lunch here.

811
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:31,027
Departure is at 1:00 p.m.

812
01:01:31,472 --> 01:01:34,800
There is a village six kilometers from here.

813
01:01:35,378 --> 01:01:37,003
From there, we will be on a bus road.

814
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:38,886
Then it's straight to Nagoya.

815
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,597
We'll take a short break in Nagoya.

816
01:01:40,948 --> 01:01:47,167
Then we'll drive the Meishin bypass and be on our way.
We should be in Osaka by 5:00.

817
01:01:47,566 --> 01:01:53,402
Understood?
You're free to go until 5:00. But don't be late for the departure time.

818
01:01:55,494 --> 01:01:57,877
It's a hell of a road, isn't it?

819
01:02:03,222 --> 01:02:04,425
But it's a nice place, though, isn't it?

820
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:05,917
Nice weather.

821
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,323
When was the last time you were in Nagoya?

822
01:02:10,698 --> 01:02:11,464
I wonder when.

823
01:02:12,167 --> 01:02:13,034
Was it Saturday?

824
01:02:13,448 --> 01:02:15,323
No, it was a weekday.

825
01:02:15,894 --> 01:02:17,456
That's why there weren't many people.

826
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:22,862
As I recall, that was the day after the 26th of Nov holiday, right?

827
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:24,191
Oh yeah.

828
01:02:24,448 --> 01:02:25,331
26th?

829
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:29,581
Then what time did you arrive in Tokyo on the 27th?

830
01:02:29,808 --> 01:02:30,816
It was rather early.

831
01:02:31,011 --> 01:02:34,527
We left Nagoya at 7:00 a.m., so it was around 3:00 a.m.

832
01:02:34,909 --> 01:02:39,174
On November 27th, at 3:30, that accident happened.

833
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:42,283
That's for sure.

834
01:02:49,057 --> 01:02:50,791
There's no way to know for sure.

835
01:02:52,494 --> 01:02:54,471
How do I get them to confess?

836
01:03:14,017 --> 01:03:15,064
It's time to depart.

837
01:03:15,767 --> 01:03:16,682
Lend me the fire.

838
01:03:18,807 --> 01:03:19,557
Hold on.

839
01:03:22,848 --> 01:03:23,918
You're police.

840
01:03:54,614 --> 01:03:56,919
I saw you push that motorcycle off the cliff.

841
01:03:57,534 --> 01:03:59,087
Why should you abandon your car?

842
01:03:59,702 --> 01:04:01,069
Tell me!

843
01:04:05,997 --> 01:04:07,150
It's a stolen car, isn't it?

844
01:04:12,294 --> 01:04:13,807
Tell me!

845
01:04:16,494 --> 01:04:18,894
I just helped him.

846
01:04:19,962 --> 01:04:20,869
It's a stolen car, isn't it?

847
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:22,230
Yeah

848
01:04:22,415 --> 01:04:23,789
What are you doing with it in Osaka?

849
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:25,381
Sell them?

850
01:04:29,317 --> 01:04:32,977
November 27th, last time you guys were on your way back from Nagoya.

851
01:04:33,967 --> 01:04:37,984
You were speeding in Yamashita-cho on Loop Route 7 on your way home from Nagoya the other day?

852
01:04:40,589 --> 01:04:43,443
Who ran over the kid at the amusement park?

853
01:04:43,689 --> 01:04:44,976
I don't know.

854
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,450
It was not me.

855
01:04:47,475 --> 01:04:49,492
I knew it was Yazawa!

856
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,443
Wait!

857
01:05:02,070 --> 01:05:02,703
Wait!

858
01:05:04,016 --> 01:05:04,762
Damn it!

859
01:05:26,636 --> 01:05:28,630
What are you doing?

860
01:05:30,864 --> 01:05:31,944
Don't be late.

861
01:05:31,969 --> 01:05:33,658
Sorry I was looking around.

862
01:05:57,373 --> 01:05:58,133
Where's Tajima?

863
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,932
He'll be back soon.

864
01:06:00,223 --> 01:06:02,483
He told me to catch up with us later?

865
01:06:03,020 --> 01:06:04,087
Ok let's go.

866
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:30,178
Not a phone around here?

867
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:31,769
No.

868
01:06:32,231 --> 01:06:33,997
You have to go to the village.

869
01:12:52,992 --> 01:12:54,706
You made good job.

870
01:12:54,731 --> 01:12:55,494
Let me take your photo.

871
01:12:55,654 --> 01:12:57,301
You're a motorcycle cop for the Metropolitan Police Department?

872
01:12:59,562 --> 01:13:00,416
Stay away.

873
01:13:01,829 --> 01:13:04,902
When did you find out that Yazawa was the hit-and-run driver?

874
01:13:04,927 --> 01:13:06,004
Say something.

875
01:13:06,044 --> 01:13:08,791
It's not good for cops to play individually.

876
01:13:09,816 --> 01:13:10,822
How do you feel about the arrest of the perpetrators?

877
01:13:12,136 --> 01:13:13,669
Are you glad?

878
01:13:15,159 --> 01:13:17,859
I'm not happy about the injured child.

879
01:13:17,961 --> 01:13:19,435
Wait.

880
01:13:33,655 --> 01:13:35,102
Keep going.

881
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,951
Good for you.
You're walking again.

882
01:13:46,453 --> 01:13:47,660
I'm glad?

883
01:13:47,866 --> 01:13:48,940
Thank you.

884
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:50,900
I'm so relieved he got better.

885
01:13:51,013 --> 01:13:52,306
You must have been worried.

886
01:13:52,446 --> 01:13:53,873
Thank you very much.

887
01:13:54,801 --> 01:13:56,301
I saw it in the newspaper.

888
01:13:59,514 --> 01:14:00,867
He's still injured?

889
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:06,300
He doesn't walk alone because he's been resting for a long time.

890
01:14:10,217 --> 01:14:12,637
Come to here,Tamio.

891
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:13,697
Can you?

892
01:14:16,124 --> 01:14:19,484
Come on.
You are man.

893
01:14:19,731 --> 01:14:20,484
I'll make it.

894
01:14:31,482 --> 01:14:33,981
Well done.
I'm so relieved.

895
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:46,565
Damn it.

896
01:14:49,040 --> 01:14:50,320
Are you going to chase again?

897
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:54,353
He went that fast on the sharp downhill curve.
That's the most dangerous thing I've ever seen.

898
01:14:56,834 --> 01:15:01,214
By the end of the day we have to find an apartment.

899
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:02,108
But..

900
01:15:02,379 --> 01:15:04,245
Go ahead if you want.

901
01:15:08,266 --> 01:15:09,192
You won.

902
01:15:09,412 --> 01:15:10,192
Get on my back.

903
01:15:24,367 --> 01:15:33,733
THE END

Please enter from entrance

4
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:26,843
Oh It's been a long time, young madam

5
00:01:26,899 --> 00:01:31,445
Your father in law worried about you until the day he died.

6
00:01:31,594 --> 00:01:32,531
I see

7
00:01:35,828 --> 00:01:37,023
Yoko

00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:39,031
Sorry for being late

9
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:45,179
Sorry for interrupting so suddenly.

10
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:50,031
What the hell you are saying?
You are the wife of the family here.

11
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,211
Our dad has passed way.
Why you didn't telegram us

12
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:57,343
I was sorry.
I was on the trip

13
00:01:57,679 --> 00:01:59,289
With whom and where did you go?

14
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:05,549
I'll talk you about it later

15
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,510
You're my wife,Ok?
Be a nice wife for me tonight

16
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:15,971
We are ashamed of you.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,697
Our boss and others are here

18
00:02:26,422 --> 00:02:27,890
Oh wife

19
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,140
Nice to see you

20
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,453
Nice to see you

21
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:36,703
Please burn incense.

22
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:50,109
Your dad worried about you and Shinsuke all the way

23
00:02:51,711 --> 00:02:54,578
You lost nice person

24
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,570
We have our father's will?

25
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:00,649
I don't know about it

26
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:04,977
I got it from him before he die

27
00:03:05,774 --> 00:03:11,727
All family members are here tonight.
And Our boss will be the testimony. so I will read out

28
00:03:12,243 --> 00:03:13,665
Ok go ahead

29
00:03:14,009 --> 00:03:16,860
Why didn't he tell us about it?

30
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:18,485
Ok go ahead

31
00:03:23,835 --> 00:03:27,671
People will be happy to go to heaven without thinking about it.

32
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:34,913
But I worry something if I die

33
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:38,595
I was under failure in my business in Kyushu.

34
00:03:39,603 --> 00:03:40,814
I have no money

35
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:42,001
No money?

36
00:03:42,283 --> 00:03:43,494
What the hell?

37
00:03:45,103 --> 00:03:48,009
He asked me about the business issue

38
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:52,072
He kept secret to you about that.
And he tried to get it better

39
00:03:52,126 --> 00:03:54,181
I didn't know he had no money

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,548
That's true.
This house is related about that

41
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,111
This house is mortgaged.

42
00:04:01,478 --> 00:04:02,595
No way!

43
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:07,658
His Kyushu mountain project failed due to flooding.

44
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:12,384
He died early because his business failed.

45
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:16,697
I feel sorry about you and your wife

46
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,850
Don't cry, mom

47
00:04:24,405 --> 00:04:28,749
Our dad was so stupid.
Why he invested in mountain project?

48
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:31,038
He should have asked me about it

49
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:33,897
And there is another will for you

50
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:40,295
You are selfish and naive.

51
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:42,202
That's him

52
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:47,186
Good luck changing your mind for my mother.

53
00:04:48,406 --> 00:04:55,031
You should divorce with Yoko, and step in new life

54
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:57,446
He has nothing to do with us

55
00:04:58,366 --> 00:05:02,928
Tashiro,The will should not be binding.

56
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:04,342
Yes, that's true

57
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,569
I'm for what he thought, Sawano

58
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:12,202
You fix the problems in your home and move on with your new life.

59
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:17,116
We have no problem.
Nothing will be problem if Yoko get back home

60
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:22,921
I think you are in a very difficult situation.

61
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:27,835
Mind your own business

62
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,507
don't be angry with him

63
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:32,015
You should apologize to him.

64
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,975
he is the president of your company

65
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:38,913
Hold on,Shinsuke

66
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,978
Oh my god

67
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:55,933
It was fate that Yoko was unhappy

68
00:06:01,587 --> 00:06:05,196
Yoko and Mitsuharu's romance began when they were students.

69
00:06:06,712 --> 00:06:10,775
But they parted very unhappy in Hokkaido.

70
00:06:14,304 --> 00:06:16,499
Mitsuharu was missing

71
00:06:17,312 --> 00:06:20,484
she couldn't live without him

72
00:06:23,765 --> 00:06:26,828
Later she married Shinsuke Sawano.

73
00:06:27,874 --> 00:06:33,406
It was a very gorgeous wedding, but she felt very sad.

74
00:06:34,863 --> 00:06:37,121
But Mitsuharu is alive

75
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:42,519
He lived with Chikako in a farmhouse in Ishikari.

76
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:45,049
Then they ended up meeting

77
00:06:46,018 --> 00:06:50,119
she was already married.
For her it was very sad.

78
00:06:51,377 --> 00:06:55,619
Shinsuke and his mother-in-law doubted their relationship.

79
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,169
Yoko couldn't trust him and decided to divorce him.

80
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:22,155
He was asked by Nimura to go to Cambodia for work

81
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:28,265
The day before his departure they went to Memories Park

82
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:38,571
Mitsuharu returned to Japan after a year

83
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:42,829
He went to see her on the Noto Peninsula

84
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:50,038
she was happy to meet him.
But her father died, so she had to return to the Sawano family again.

85
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:54,972
End of Episode 1&2&3 Summary

86
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,795
Sis

87
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,365
Welcome back

88
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:03,936
you weren't alone and lonely?

89
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:04,951
Come on!

90
00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:06,303
What's wrong?

91
00:09:06,647 --> 00:09:09,881
Mitsuharu is here.

92
00:09:12,046 --> 00:09:13,195
Really?

93
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:20,359
I'm back.
Yoko has come back

94
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,398
Welcome

95
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:25,562
Chikako told me that you were coming to house today.

96
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:29,250
I was planning to go home soon, but I was busy with various things

97
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:33,523
Chikako was worried that you wouldn't come back.

98
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,984
I worried about you

99
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,718
I'm going out

100
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:38,625
Where?

101
00:09:39,515 --> 00:09:41,265
I don't wanna disturb you

102
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:48,544
i will buy your food.
See you

103
00:09:54,591 --> 00:09:58,419
Were you OK?
You had a hard time

104
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:02,443
It doesn't work very well.

105
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:03,740
For what?

106
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:08,419
I tried to settle the divorce issue with Mr. Sawano once.

107
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:10,571
But It does not work

108
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:15,696
please tell me more about it

109
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,472
Hey you

110
00:10:33,152 --> 00:10:34,347
You're Chikako,right?

111
00:10:34,777 --> 00:10:37,464
Yes  I am.
What can I do for you?

112
00:10:38,066 --> 00:10:39,496
I know Yoko has back home

113
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,730
I have no idea

114
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,316
Don't pretend you don't know

115
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:45,019
I know she is at home

116
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:46,394
Excuse me

117
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:47,058
Hold on

118
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,824
Get hands off of me

119
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:51,019
will you kidnap me?

120
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,459
Sis

121
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,533
i wanted to talk to you but why is he here?

122
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,166
Don't get me wrong

123
00:11:10,268 --> 00:11:12,815
Come with me!

124
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,261
Let's keep calm and talk together

125
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:26,478
I understand very well that you are angry.

126
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:34,166
I was rumored to have died in an accident just before I got married to Yoko.

127
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,759
This was really a disaster for me

128
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:43,204
I tried to forget Yoko for two years.

129
00:11:43,595 --> 00:11:44,868
I had a very hard time.

130
00:11:44,893 --> 00:11:49,259
I don't think your marriage with Yoko is happy.

131
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,876
no one is bad.
everything was weird from the beginning

132
00:11:57,314 --> 00:12:01,095
It's already been over a year since you guys separated.

133
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,695
Yoko is no longer your wife, I think

134
00:12:05,945 --> 00:12:08,664
Your blaming her will do no good.

135
00:12:09,699 --> 00:12:13,691
I know I have no right to tell you this

136
00:12:15,098 --> 00:12:18,480
will you divorce her?

137
00:12:21,693 --> 00:12:23,505
Is that all what you wanna say?

138
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,810
i want to explain to you

139
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:33,693
you are her cheating partner.
You used to be in jail for adultery

140
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:36,857
I won't divorce her.
Mind your own business

141
00:12:37,505 --> 00:12:44,296
If you say such things, I will fight you all to the end.

142
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:53,202
notice.
At the request of SAWANO SHINSUKE, 1-chome, Ichiban-cho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo

143
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:58,703
You had an affair with my wife and destroyed my marriage.

144
00:13:00,233 --> 00:13:11,343
I have suffered mental persecution from you, and I am claiming 5 million yen in compensation from you.

145
00:13:11,984 --> 00:13:18,007
If you don't pay the ransom, I will take legal action.

146
00:13:18,585 --> 00:13:20,804
He is so selfish

147
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:25,155
He sent this to you and he's so angry

148
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,358
If Yoko is free, I am willing to pay him alimony.

149
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:31,518
But 5 million yen is too high

150
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:34,065
Does she know about this?

151
00:13:34,823 --> 00:13:37,752
He also sent Yoko this same copy.
She told me to meet him once

152
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:52,407
Excuse me

153
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:54,993
Excuse me

154
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,059
It's been a whole

155
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:02,918
Yoko

156
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,278
I never thought my child would betray me

157
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:21,473
Relatives are very cold to me. When the money runs out, everyone goes away

158
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:25,911
Shinsuke has left me too

159
00:14:26,903 --> 00:14:28,997
I'm alone and lonely

160
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:31,403
I know how you feel

161
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:34,582
Thank you for coming

162
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:38,777
i know what you are good at now

163
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:41,994
Will you live here with me from today onwards?

164
00:14:42,143 --> 00:14:44,674
I don't mean that

165
00:14:44,979 --> 00:14:48,377
you came here because you were worried about me?

166
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:52,603
I'm here to talk to Shinsuke

167
00:14:53,087 --> 00:14:54,158
To shinsuke?

168
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,785
What for?

169
00:14:58,589 --> 00:15:03,230
He is claiming compensation from Mr. Sugano for me.

170
00:15:04,555 --> 00:15:05,235
He is claiming compensation?

171
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,712
he didn't tell me about it

172
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,923
How much?

173
00:15:12,571 --> 00:15:15,063
It's not your business

174
00:15:15,368 --> 00:15:17,938
tell me everything

175
00:15:18,722 --> 00:15:19,808
How much?

176
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:27,011
If you were a lawyer, you would have checked to see if there was any effort on his part to pay me the $5 million.

177
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:32,472
I have no problem going to trial.

178
00:15:33,214 --> 00:15:39,011
If you want to go to trial, I don't need to be here.

179
00:15:39,551 --> 00:15:41,098
Why you've come here?

180
00:15:42,887 --> 00:15:47,395
i think money solves everything

181
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,942
What do you mean?

182
00:15:49,395 --> 00:15:53,848
I think you can reduce the price by 5 million yen.

183
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,445
Do you think the alimony should be reduced?

184
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:58,544
Kind of

185
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:10,458
If I pay the money, can Yoko get a divorce?

186
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,075
You can put that in the condition too

187
00:16:20,614 --> 00:16:21,521
Hold on

188
00:16:21,974 --> 00:16:23,435
We need to talk more

189
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:25,974
money is no good for anyone

190
00:16:26,021 --> 00:16:26,521
I don't mean that

191
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:28,747
don't make excuses.
i will give you this room

192
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,709
are you guys quarreling?

193
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:38,264
What can I do for you?

194
00:16:38,491 --> 00:16:42,280
I'm here for that alimony.
he wants to negotiate

195
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,428
How much?

196
00:16:43,522 --> 00:16:47,569
If you go to court, you can only get about 500,000 yen at most.

197
00:16:48,772 --> 00:16:50,467
he knows that too

198
00:16:50,819 --> 00:16:52,202
So How much?

199
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,280
How about 1 million?

200
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:55,780
1 million?

201
00:16:55,975 --> 00:16:57,202
I think that's fair

202
00:16:57,397 --> 00:17:01,233
you can ask him for alimony many times

203
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:02,897
It's too cheap

204
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,428
Here's the 1 million yen

205
00:17:07,405 --> 00:17:09,655
I thought it would be better to pay early

206
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,045
are you going to Hokkaido soon?

207
00:17:13,452 --> 00:17:17,194
I borrowed this money in the form of an advance payment for work.

208
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,256
Don't be sad

209
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:26,341
If I deliver this money tomorrow, you will be free.

210
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:28,191
But I worry

211
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,027
Does it work well?

212
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:35,316
If you are worried, you can ask someone to be present.

213
00:17:36,816 --> 00:17:38,543
You're lawyer...

214
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,004
kanzaki?

215
00:17:41,184 --> 00:17:43,832
I think he can help you

216
00:17:45,305 --> 00:17:48,789
It would be great if he helps me

217
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,883
Yoko

218
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:57,625
Please come to Hokkaido when the divorce issue is resolved.

219
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:03,883
We can start new life

220
00:18:07,438 --> 00:18:09,860
I drunk too much last night

221
00:18:10,227 --> 00:18:12,243
Did you celebrate Tokyo giants won?

222
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:17,016
you say nice things to me

223
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:22,345
Everyone knows you are big fan of Giants

224
00:18:22,423 --> 00:18:24,251
Are you sure?

225
00:18:24,322 --> 00:18:25,634
This is the invoice

226
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:27,493
Please submit the money

227
00:18:30,206 --> 00:18:31,354
Let me check

228
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,175
Hold on

229
00:18:32,628 --> 00:18:33,785
Where is Sawano's divorce papers?

230
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,257
I'll give it to you later

231
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,820
I won't give you this money until you give it to us.

232
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,382
Do you still want to go to court?

233
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,179
It's not what you promised us

234
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:53,086
If you go to court, you can settle it for less than 1 million yen

235
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,187
3,400000yen at most

236
00:18:55,726 --> 00:18:58,750
i have heard a lot of rumors about you

237
00:18:59,367 --> 00:19:01,601
The trial won't go well like last time.

238
00:19:03,818 --> 00:19:05,482
That was nice

239
00:19:06,372 --> 00:19:10,263
To be honest,he needs money too

240
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,605
I'll see you in a few days

241
00:19:20,371 --> 00:19:22,957
i was thinking too easily

242
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:29,136
Kanzaki-san is by my side, so I think things will go well this time.

243
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,377
Thank you in advance

244
00:19:33,486 --> 00:19:34,510
Don't worry

245
00:19:35,963 --> 00:19:39,093
See you guys in Hokkaido

246
00:19:39,117 --> 00:19:41,789
Don't worry.
See you

247
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:47,453
Have a safe trip

248
00:19:51,252 --> 00:19:53,018
Long time no see

249
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:57,518
How are you?

250
00:19:57,543 --> 00:19:58,583
Thanks

251
00:20:06,445 --> 00:20:08,320
Does it look good on me?

252
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:16,172
From now on, I should pay for summer clothes in cash.

253
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:20,731
Thank you for doing business with us for a long time but...

254
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:23,004
Why you have come here?

255
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,324
Because I don't have cash

256
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:28,561
he said he would come to my house but

257
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:33,928
I heard that you will pay this money.
It costs 180000 yen

258
00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:39,374
How do you know I have that money?

259
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:43,092
I heard from Tashiro that you have money.

260
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,217
1 million yen

261
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:49,131
Shinsuke will take the money later

262
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:54,967
I can't pay this, sorry

263
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:58,374
You decline?
Ok

264
00:20:59,022 --> 00:21:02,944
I have no money so please call the police

265
00:21:15,077 --> 00:21:18,413
Will they bring the alimony tomorrow?

266
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,819
they declined it

267
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:23,491
I want them to suffer mentally

268
00:21:23,702 --> 00:21:25,241
For about 1 million yen, they...

269
00:21:25,405 --> 00:21:27,491
But her mother-in-law received it

270
00:21:27,725 --> 00:21:29,069
Eh? really?

271
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:32,765
She received 200,000 yen as a deposit from Yoko.

272
00:21:44,623 --> 00:21:48,709
What's wrong about money, Mom

273
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:55,779
You are very bad for taking money from Yoko.

274
00:21:56,162 --> 00:21:58,436
How did you know about Palimony?

275
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,139
A god tell me

276
00:22:05,831 --> 00:22:06,846
Oh welcome

277
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,213
You are really great for making up your mind!

278
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:13,268
I thought that would be better

279
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:14,901
when will they bring the money?

280
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,409
they bring around noon

281
00:22:18,346 --> 00:22:19,628
Then I'll wait here

282
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,565
Please sign this form before they arrive.

283
00:22:27,057 --> 00:22:29,643
this is divorce papers

284
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,283
These are the terms of our deal with them.

285
00:22:32,923 --> 00:22:33,720
No way

286
00:22:34,213 --> 00:22:38,127
Clam down.
I did not want to go to trial.

287
00:22:39,088 --> 00:22:41,104
I thought a settlement would make more money

288
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,854
you were going to trick me from the beginning

289
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:49,953
If you don't like it, change lawyers.

290
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,289
But No one want to handle this work

291
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:58,203
my father took care of you

292
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,976
What the hell you are talking about?
I was just getting paid as a lawyer

293
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:08,828
I do this kind of work for you.

294
00:23:10,078 --> 00:23:12,203
i can't do this job anymore

295
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,422
Stop it

296
00:23:15,917 --> 00:23:23,277
If I reveal your cheating, you will be charged for alimony.

297
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:26,271
do you speak it in court?

298
00:23:26,591 --> 00:23:30,084
I'm going to do something with you

299
00:23:54,743 --> 00:24:03,643
To Mitsuharu,
Shinsuke is missing, I'm looking for him

300
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:07,252
I have no means of doing anything

301
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:14,737
I haven't seen you in two months.
I should be there

302
00:24:16,073 --> 00:24:20,682
I think he ran away because he hurt Lawyer Tashiro.

303
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:27,417
he is cautious.
I feel sorry about him

304
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:33,424
But the matter of divorce with him was postponed

305
00:24:34,533 --> 00:24:38,174
I feel sorry about it

306
00:24:39,248 --> 00:24:42,358
To Yoko.
I have happy news for you

307
00:24:43,327 --> 00:24:45,584
We are likely to find Chikako's grandfather soon.

308
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:51,780
We visited a farmhouse in Ishikari where we used to live

309
00:24:52,412 --> 00:24:55,178
We found something about him

310
00:24:56,077 --> 00:25:00,623
He currently lives in a fishing village near Hakodate.

311
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:03,342
We'll go there to see him

312
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:11,619
how was the train trip?

313
00:25:11,697 --> 00:25:13,971
I came by sleeper so I slept.

314
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:18,561
How long does it take from here to the fishing village?

315
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:20,241
About 2 hours

316
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:29,098
I'm confused

317
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:30,418
Why?

318
00:25:30,691 --> 00:25:33,512
what should i do if i meet him?

319
00:25:34,184 --> 00:25:36,598
you really don't know what he looks like?

320
00:25:37,941 --> 00:25:41,495
i remember him hugging me

321
00:25:51,079 --> 00:25:55,750
Grandfather lives in such a beautiful place

322
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,452
Is Sugano from Tokyo?

323
00:26:13,054 --> 00:26:14,788
He must be my grand dad

324
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:20,411
are you my grandfather?

325
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,114
You're the Chikako?

326
00:26:22,388 --> 00:26:25,505
Do you remember what I look?

327
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:30,005
I'm not your grand father.
He is over there

328
00:26:30,304 --> 00:26:33,140
Oh you are not

329
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:40,609
You're the Sugano.
I'm Gosuke who lives with Yoshida

330
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:46,562
After receiving a telegram from you, he suddenly said that he did not want to see his grandson.

331
00:26:46,846 --> 00:26:47,611
He doesn't wanna meet?

332
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,189
I have been arguing with him about that since yesterday.
But never mind

333
00:26:58,257 --> 00:27:00,023
Are you there?

334
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,976
Where has he gone?

335
00:27:05,687 --> 00:27:08,148
why doesn't he want to see me?

336
00:27:08,554 --> 00:27:13,882
he is ashamed that he has no money.
he has a difficult personality

337
00:27:14,562 --> 00:27:15,460
I'll check it out

338
00:27:18,609 --> 00:27:20,609
he has a difficult personality

339
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,656
Don't think too much

340
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:28,719
I think he will be relieved when he sees you

341
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,196
You're my granddad?

342
00:28:18,999 --> 00:28:21,905
I remembered how you looked

343
00:28:23,116 --> 00:28:27,234
Do you remember what I look?

344
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:31,741
she is your grandson

345
00:28:32,069 --> 00:28:36,866
She is the grandson you were always talking about.

346
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,296
Really?

347
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:44,484
Chikako

348
00:28:45,219 --> 00:28:46,508
Granddad!

349
00:28:51,743 --> 00:28:54,899
I live in poverty and I'm ashamed

350
00:28:55,626 --> 00:28:58,071
It's very rural here

351
00:28:59,149 --> 00:29:03,415
i always worried about you

352
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,561
let's go to Tokyo with me

353
00:29:09,217 --> 00:29:16,326
I won't leave him and go to Tokyo.
I worry about him

354
00:29:16,729 --> 00:29:20,417
I’ve been taking care of you

355
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:23,463
I’ve been taking care of you!

356
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:27,034
don't you want to live with me?

357
00:29:27,096 --> 00:29:29,159
Don't get me wrong

358
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:32,681
Please discuss that with her later.

359
00:29:37,882 --> 00:29:43,968
He has a very difficult personality and worries about small things.

360
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,249
Don't you think so?

361
00:30:04,571 --> 00:30:06,610
I feel sorry for her, she's all alone.

362
00:30:08,626 --> 00:30:12,782
It can't be helped.
Her grandfather doesn't want to be in Tokyo yet.

363
00:30:14,217 --> 00:30:17,662
I think they will live together after she graduates.

364
00:30:20,459 --> 00:30:23,357
Fujikawa takes care of her, so no worries

365
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,959
let's talk about us

366
00:30:33,983 --> 00:30:36,178
Are you still worried about SAWANO-san?

367
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:41,811
I don't mean that

368
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,100
Cheer up

369
00:30:46,733 --> 00:30:49,936
We will start a new life in Sapporo from tomorrow.

370
00:31:11,395 --> 00:31:12,817
What's wrong?

371
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,051
Nothing

372
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,457
Let's go

373
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,260
What's wrong?

374
00:31:26,035 --> 00:31:26,981
Are you tired

375
00:31:31,402 --> 00:31:32,832
i go to the building site and be back soon

376
00:31:37,362 --> 00:31:40,776
Let's have party tonight

377
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,924
Was that person driving our car?

378
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:06,916
Yes

379
00:32:08,221 --> 00:32:10,213
he may have a different name

380
00:32:10,893 --> 00:32:12,111
He must be Noguchi

381
00:32:12,447 --> 00:32:14,361
He is a new employee from Tokyo.

382
00:32:14,541 --> 00:32:15,674
Let me check

383
00:32:20,125 --> 00:32:21,383
Is he?

384
00:32:24,727 --> 00:32:25,860
He is

385
00:32:26,281 --> 00:32:26,953
Yes

386
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,125
he won't come back to the office until night

387
00:32:29,375 --> 00:32:31,789
But he always comes home for lunch

388
00:32:32,586 --> 00:32:34,453
You can see him at his home if you are in hurry

389
00:32:38,018 --> 00:32:43,464
Mr. Noguchi always says that his wife's home cooking is delicious.

390
00:32:43,831 --> 00:32:44,589
His wife?

391
00:32:45,292 --> 00:32:49,073
he's been married for a month

392
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:51,817
He comes home at noon every day to eat her cooking.

393
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:54,496
Madam

394
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:59,341
Has your husband returned yet?

395
00:32:59,669 --> 00:33:01,161
Not yet

396
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:02,825
You have a guest

397
00:33:08,326 --> 00:33:08,943
See you

398
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:33,406
You think he got another new woman

399
00:33:34,101 --> 00:33:35,570
Don't get me wrong

400
00:33:35,726 --> 00:33:38,031
But I'm serious

401
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:41,585
I understood his situation and get together with him.

402
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,675
He promised to divorce his wife and marry me.

403
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:53,676
You don't seem to believe me

404
00:33:55,379 --> 00:34:01,473
No way.
I have suffered a lot over the last two years about my divorce.

405
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:05,183
it's hard to believe your story

406
00:34:05,855 --> 00:34:11,659
As you know, he caused an incident in Tokyo.
That's why he couldn't contact you

407
00:34:13,556 --> 00:34:18,189
But the lawyer didn't sue, so there was no case.

408
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,275
He doesn't worry about going to jail

409
00:34:24,084 --> 00:34:26,201
It would have been better if you had let us know that earlier.

410
00:34:28,201 --> 00:34:30,552
i can't believe he changed

411
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,087
I’m afraid he is cheating on you

412
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:38,993
Please don't speak ill of him.

413
00:34:41,522 --> 00:34:45,920
He's back.
You'll know if I am cheated or not

414
00:34:53,152 --> 00:34:54,222
Yoko

415
00:34:55,534 --> 00:34:57,253
I'm sorry

416
00:34:57,894 --> 00:35:01,128
i suddenly have a headache

417
00:35:03,792 --> 00:35:04,971
Are you Ok,Yoko?

418
00:35:05,026 --> 00:35:06,167
Yoko!

419
00:35:06,823 --> 00:35:07,753
Yoko!

420
00:35:21,066 --> 00:35:22,613
What does doctor say?

421
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,215
he says she's fine

422
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:33,363
her headache is better.
She will feel better if she sleeps

423
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:39,365
If the same symptoms appear, she needs a thorough examination at a large hospital.

424
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:42,716
i was relieved to hear that

425
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:47,752
This

426
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:49,705
What's this?

427
00:35:50,103 --> 00:35:52,720
This is Yoko and I's divorce papers

428
00:35:55,017 --> 00:35:57,861
Please give this to Yoko

429
00:36:00,034 --> 00:36:05,940
I left Tokyo and now live in Sapporo.

430
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:09,222
I found out how I am stupid

431
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:15,939
I only love the woman called Tokiko

432
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:19,824
I'll be here for a while

433
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,886
I see

434
00:36:25,172 --> 00:36:27,001
I hear you work in Sapporo

435
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:31,626
If possible, I don't want to see you very much

436
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:40,320
Please look after Yoko

437
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,386
I was surprised

438
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:07,253
We finally get married

439
00:37:11,402 --> 00:37:12,511
Don't cry

440
00:37:13,956 --> 00:37:16,253
i feel dreamy

441
00:37:17,956 --> 00:37:23,566
I can't see anything,Mitsuharu

442
00:37:24,694 --> 00:37:26,788
Because you are crying

443
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:28,710
No

444
00:37:29,569 --> 00:37:33,811
I can't see your face

445
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,399
Flowers..and Neon..

446
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:47,264
I can't see anything,

447
00:37:48,871 --> 00:37:50,567
I can't see anything,

448
00:37:51,293 --> 00:37:52,606
Yoko!

449
00:38:48,011 --> 00:38:50,589
Don't worry

450
00:39:17,293 --> 00:39:18,754
Toki..when did you come?

451
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,739
Since 1 week ago

452
00:39:22,926 --> 00:39:24,871
I decided to work in Tokyo again

453
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:28,603
she has a brain tumor

454
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:33,955
I was surprised to hear that from Mr. Fujikawa.

455
00:39:35,188 --> 00:39:42,381
But since it was discovered so quickly, I don't think she has anything to worry about.

456
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:47,929
Toki,he has had brain surgery

457
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:51,019
I forgot it

458
00:39:51,862 --> 00:39:52,620
She'll be  fine

459
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:54,433
Don't worry

460
00:39:55,011 --> 00:39:57,066
you always worry us

461
00:40:29,415 --> 00:40:31,673
Who are Yoko Sawano's relatives?

462
00:40:33,157 --> 00:40:34,657
Please come with me

463
00:40:40,374 --> 00:40:41,288
Please come in

464
00:40:47,562 --> 00:40:49,570
her surgery went well

465
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:58,406
I think her headaches and numbness in her limbs will go away.

466
00:40:58,695 --> 00:40:59,804
I see

467
00:41:02,556 --> 00:41:04,674
but it is temporary

468
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,103
her tumor was getting worse

469
00:41:13,983 --> 00:41:15,975
I couldn't get rid of them all

470
00:41:17,451 --> 00:41:21,037
does that mean it's too late?

471
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:25,064
You might be right

472
00:41:27,252 --> 00:41:30,455
she will be fine once

473
00:41:31,975 --> 00:41:36,632
but i don't think she will live long

474
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:17,591
Yoko

475
00:42:18,958 --> 00:42:19,419
Yoko

476
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,639
If the tumor adheres to the surface of the brain, it is easy to remove.

477
00:43:11,459 --> 00:43:13,107
In that case, the tumor is completely cured.

478
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:21,919
But her tumor is inside her brain, so surgery is not possible.

479
00:43:22,629 --> 00:43:24,739
what will happen to her?

480
00:43:26,207 --> 00:43:30,575
her tumor is getting bigger

481
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:32,801
Like a cancer

482
00:43:35,004 --> 00:43:36,668
I feel sorry about her

483
00:43:39,386 --> 00:43:43,902
But now she has no choice but to think this

484
00:43:45,937 --> 00:43:50,062
She will live a normal life once her surgical scars heal.

485
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:55,375
Please spend time with her happily until she dies.

486
00:43:56,948 --> 00:43:59,744
About how long?

487
00:44:00,658 --> 00:44:04,393
maybe 1 year

488
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:11,328
A year and a half later, I think she will have symptoms again.

489
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:18,265
I can't say for sure what will happen

490
00:44:20,038 --> 00:44:25,741
I think she will live in about a year and a half to two years.

491
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:27,623
2 years

492
00:44:31,209 --> 00:44:34,904
let us get married

493
00:44:36,758 --> 00:44:42,305
I don't care if you don't live long

494
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:49,819
Even if you die tomorrow, I still want to marry you

495
00:44:51,906 --> 00:44:55,890
So get better soon

496
00:45:48,134 --> 00:45:49,322
I'm like in a dream

497
00:45:51,705 --> 00:45:55,025
I gave up on getting married at that time

498
00:45:55,743 --> 00:45:56,642
Really?

499
00:45:57,642 --> 00:46:02,883
When I was told that I would have surgery at the hospital as soon as I returned from Hokkaido by plane.

500
00:46:04,218 --> 00:46:05,374
That bring me back my memory

501
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:17,311
Mitsuharu

502
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:23,709
Please be honest

503
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:31,077
will i die from a failed surgery?

504
00:46:31,974 --> 00:46:36,880
Cut out your tumor and you'll be fine

505
00:46:37,326 --> 00:46:39,138
Can I trust you?

506
00:46:41,211 --> 00:46:44,688
i want you to be honest

507
00:46:45,274 --> 00:46:47,524
Don't worry about that

508
00:47:02,718 --> 00:47:06,913
Honeymoon trip to Ise-Shima for 3 nights and 4 days

509
00:47:23,082 --> 00:47:26,238
you looked really happy

510
00:47:28,183 --> 00:47:32,137
I cried in my heart to see your smile

511
00:47:34,183 --> 00:47:38,745
i think it's too early to give up

512
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:46,988
Advances in medicine may lead to new treatments

513
00:47:50,561 --> 00:47:57,522
Our love will cure your disease

514
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:09,703
Did you get a reply from the doctor again?

515
00:48:12,258 --> 00:48:16,992
I heard that Meiji Medical University has a radiotherapy specialist.

516
00:48:17,828 --> 00:48:22,320
However, it has not reached the clinical stage yet.

517
00:48:24,825 --> 00:48:26,607
How's Yoko these day

518
00:48:27,841 --> 00:48:31,286
she is fine and has an appetite

519
00:48:34,498 --> 00:48:36,482
I lost my appetite recently

520
00:48:36,896 --> 00:48:39,873
take care of your health

521
00:48:41,951 --> 00:48:42,771
Fujikawa

522
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:49,396
I feel uneasy even at work

523
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:53,738
I worry about Yoko

524
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:13,646
You found me

525
00:49:14,021 --> 00:49:16,584
Please play the piano

526
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:20,917
I can't play now

527
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,924
you should practice the piano

528
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:27,160
I hear you are good

529
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:31,129
My late mother liked classical guitar

530
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:40,504
Brain tumors are common growths like any other child

531
00:49:41,646 --> 00:49:44,348
a brain tumor grows inside the skull

532
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:53,833
A malignant brain tumor slowly grows larger, causing the head to swell.

533
00:49:55,375 --> 00:50:01,375
Patient has body numbness headache dizziness nausea

534
00:50:02,679 --> 00:50:10,843
These are discovered by X-ray examination, etc.

535
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:15,031
tumor must be removed immediately

536
00:50:15,515 --> 00:50:19,726
The tumor is inside the skull so there is no room for it to spread

537
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:28,892
But as the tumor grows, it destroys the skull.

538
00:50:30,369 --> 00:50:31,353
Welcome back

539
00:50:32,486 --> 00:50:33,572
are you waiting for someone?

540
00:50:34,173 --> 00:50:35,525
I'm on the way of shopping

541
00:50:37,917 --> 00:50:39,269
Welcome back

542
00:50:39,301 --> 00:50:41,980
you guys are good friends and I envy you

543
00:50:44,129 --> 00:50:50,277
her brain tumor is the most malignant of all brain tumors

544
00:50:51,136 --> 00:50:55,011
The Tumors grow very fast

545
00:50:55,511 --> 00:51:00,675
It destroys brain tissue and is nearly impossible to remove.

546
00:51:01,437 --> 00:51:05,538
Most patients with this tumor die

547
00:51:06,677 --> 00:51:11,123
i wanted to take a nap on Sunday

548
00:51:11,663 --> 00:51:14,484
I was asked to make things and take out the trash

549
00:51:15,624 --> 00:51:18,257
I tried to call a carpenter to make

550
00:51:18,757 --> 00:51:24,187
she told me she didn't have the money to pay the carpenter

551
00:51:24,562 --> 00:51:28,195
Men don't understand why pregnancy is so hard

552
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:32,828
Even when he comes home, he doesn't help me at all.

553
00:51:33,109 --> 00:51:34,508
I really hate it

554
00:51:34,601 --> 00:51:35,765
You're in trouble

555
00:51:35,906 --> 00:51:39,351
my husband is very selfish

556
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,834
i want him to be like your husband

557
00:51:43,037 --> 00:51:44,154
You think too much

558
00:51:44,779 --> 00:51:47,186
Your husband a person who notices small things very much

559
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:48,592
No way

560
00:51:49,804 --> 00:51:53,429
I am going to leave home and annoy him.

561
00:51:54,804 --> 00:51:56,375
Can I stay at your house for about three days?

562
00:51:56,672 --> 00:51:58,906
But did she leave without staying?

563
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:04,476
When I prepared dinner, she started to worry about her husband.

564
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:11,070
She was worried about what was in the refrigerator.

565
00:52:12,101 --> 00:52:14,344
she suddenly decided to go home

566
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:16,000
That's funny

567
00:52:16,765 --> 00:52:23,554
He also told me that marrying her was a mistake.

568
00:52:23,969 --> 00:52:29,375
But the next day he bought a souvenir for his wife.

569
00:52:30,451 --> 00:52:34,966
At work, my colleagues say they fight once every two days.

570
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:42,085
What's wrong, Yoko?

571
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:49,046
What's wrong?

572
00:52:50,741 --> 00:52:52,038
I'm sorry

573
00:52:53,046 --> 00:52:54,624
I feel lonely

574
00:52:55,077 --> 00:52:56,225
Are you?

575
00:52:56,444 --> 00:52:59,046
we have never had a fight

576
00:53:03,687 --> 00:53:05,601
i think we have different personalities

577
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:11,812
they honestly say anything but we are...

578
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,783
Yoko

579
00:53:16,901 --> 00:53:17,737
I'm sorry

580
00:53:19,197 --> 00:53:20,994
You take care of me too much

581
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:24,713
I'm too happy

582
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,302
At the hospital where I work, there is a doctor named Tachibana who came back from America last year.

583
00:53:42,505 --> 00:53:48,856
He's doing research to cure brain tumors by something gas

584
00:53:49,339 --> 00:53:52,214
I think it's mustard gas

585
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:56,144
I talked with Yoko about that

586
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:01,066
The doctor wanted to visit the hospital with the data

587
00:54:04,754 --> 00:54:08,785
I also called the doctor who was in charge of your operation.

588
00:54:09,982 --> 00:54:17,404
In your wife's case, I don't think the treatment I'm researching will be very effective.

589
00:54:18,653 --> 00:54:19,872
I'm sorry

590
00:54:19,897 --> 00:54:23,239
You should give it try

591
00:54:23,264 --> 00:54:26,716
This treatment is not possible because of the risks involved.

592
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:29,833
but there is no other way

593
00:54:31,778 --> 00:54:34,692
I think you should take the risk and try treatment.

594
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:38,060
But it's too risky

595
00:54:38,919 --> 00:54:40,661
We can't do that under the current circumstances.

596
00:54:43,052 --> 00:54:43,888
I see

597
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:50,645
But in your wife's case she is very presently symptom free.

598
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:58,825
She currently has no headaches or numbness in her limbs.

599
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,645
she may have hope

600
00:55:05,442 --> 00:55:09,247
Please consult with Dr. Aoki and don't give up until the end.

601
00:55:10,768 --> 00:55:12,901
That's all what I cab say now

602
00:55:15,081 --> 00:55:18,620
Lately, there have been times when I feel like telling Yoko everything honestly.

603
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:19,995
Why?

604
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,245
I lie to her all day long

605
00:55:26,331 --> 00:55:28,425
I'm frustrated about it

606
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:33,097
would you tell her she has no life?

607
00:55:43,283 --> 00:55:47,033
I think I should tell her the truth

608
00:55:49,252 --> 00:55:51,924
we live a life of lies

609
00:55:54,166 --> 00:55:59,330
It's sad that Yoko died without knowing the truth.

610
00:56:02,603 --> 00:56:04,751
I know how you feel

611
00:56:07,705 --> 00:56:13,540
I I were her, I trust you

612
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:17,281
And go to die without knowing the truth.

613
00:56:26,779 --> 00:56:29,920
About the piano that I gave Yoko as a present

614
00:56:30,935 --> 00:56:34,678
I regret that recently

615
00:56:35,912 --> 00:56:36,709
Why?

616
00:56:38,123 --> 00:56:42,967
According to the doctor, it's been a year and a half since the operation, so it's just now.

617
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:46,732
she starts to go numb in her limbs

618
00:56:47,443 --> 00:56:50,201
If her hands start to go numb

619
00:56:51,786 --> 00:56:58,075
I think she will suffer a lot if she can't play the piano.

620
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:02,176
her hands can still move

621
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:05,895
Really?
She can play the piano?

622
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:10,575
Well, okay then, I was worried.

623
00:57:10,903 --> 00:57:14,801
she won't let me hear her play

624
00:57:15,114 --> 00:57:21,395
I see.
i made you worry

625
00:58:41,193 --> 00:58:42,451
Welcome back

626
00:58:45,139 --> 00:58:46,662
You got wet

627
00:58:47,162 --> 00:58:49,686
You've improved

628
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:53,865
I practiced the piano a lot

629
00:58:54,881 --> 00:58:56,733
You're great

630
00:58:57,584 --> 00:58:59,404
You make me wetting

631
00:59:00,967 --> 00:59:02,138
I feel cold

632
00:59:05,998 --> 00:59:10,138
she looks at me and smiles

633
00:59:10,641 --> 00:59:15,648
i can't believe she has malignancy

634
00:59:17,435 --> 00:59:21,208
there are no signs that she is progressing

635
00:59:22,193 --> 00:59:23,411
She's fine

636
00:59:25,236 --> 00:59:26,978
Little by little I'm starting to hope

637
00:59:27,861 --> 00:59:28,431
Hope?

638
00:59:30,384 --> 00:59:36,439
Doctors are also misdiagnosed.
The doctor I met the other day said it's too early to give up

639
00:59:39,548 --> 00:59:43,236
There are many cases of terminal cancer miraculously cured.

640
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,415
I hope it make happens to Yoko

641
00:59:47,001 --> 00:59:48,743
Great if so

642
00:59:49,290 --> 00:59:55,704
If she's healthy in the fall, I'll stop believing the doctor's diagnosis.

643
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:58,134
The fall

644
00:59:58,258 --> 00:59:59,008
Madam

645
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:02,345
What a lovely!

646
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:04,720
i made sweets

647
01:00:05,611 --> 01:00:09,025
I want to eat so I'll make you some tea right now

648
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:11,470
thank you for your hospitality

649
01:00:12,126 --> 01:00:17,665
It is very surprising that she is healthy

650
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,314
But it's too early to be optimistic

651
01:00:22,392 --> 01:00:26,431
You said she'll start having headaches and dizzy symptoms by summer

652
01:00:26,533 --> 01:00:30,415
I didn't mean to tell you the exact time

653
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:34,611
In her case, I think the tumor is slow to develop.

654
01:00:35,845 --> 01:00:40,829
The anti-cancer drugs used in her treatment may have been very effective.

655
01:00:41,094 --> 01:00:44,938
But there have been cases of brain tumors miraculously recovering.

656
01:00:45,485 --> 01:00:47,657
I can show you

657
01:00:49,375 --> 01:00:54,680
You may be right.
But I'm a doctor, so I don't believe in miracles.

658
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,173
but i want to believe it

659
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:04,921
I'm sorry I'm excited

660
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:15,980
Why don't you take a medical examination by Dr. Tezuka of the University of Tokyo?

661
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,472
Do you know of him?

662
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:19,730
I know his name

663
01:01:20,417 --> 01:01:26,003
He is famous for his brain surgery. i will introduce you next time

664
01:01:27,701 --> 01:01:29,841
I know how you worry

665
01:01:30,724 --> 01:01:35,419
I can't say that my diagnosis is correct.

666
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:41,779
my mom who died loved this

667
01:01:42,234 --> 01:01:43,937
What disease did she die of?

668
01:01:44,726 --> 01:01:46,515
Cancer

669
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,180
It was hard time

670
01:01:50,820 --> 01:01:54,750
she didn't know about her illness

671
01:01:56,124 --> 01:02:01,452
i cared too much for her.
I remember it every time I make sweets

672
01:02:02,946 --> 01:02:07,235
I think she may have known about her illness

673
01:02:09,071 --> 01:02:12,289
Excuse me for talking about this during dinner.

674
01:02:12,314 --> 01:02:14,766
Please eat

675
01:02:23,942 --> 01:02:24,856
I'm home

676
01:02:28,637 --> 01:02:29,247
Yoko?

677
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:34,622
Yoko?

678
01:02:40,747 --> 01:02:41,380
Yoko?

679
01:02:44,067 --> 01:02:44,716
Yoko?

680
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,817
i got surprised

681
01:02:55,849 --> 01:02:58,240
You are childish

682
01:03:00,482 --> 01:03:01,560
were you surprised?

683
01:03:05,802 --> 01:03:06,794
Yes I was

684
01:03:09,646 --> 01:03:11,287
i bought this for you

685
01:03:14,996 --> 01:03:16,590
Ticket for musical academy

686
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,488
I'm so glad

687
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:22,738
Good seat

688
01:03:23,207 --> 01:03:25,269
It's been a long time since I went to a concert

689
01:03:26,301 --> 01:03:28,918
In return, Yoko?

690
01:03:30,371 --> 01:03:32,980
Let's go to the hospital together before going to the concert

691
01:03:34,285 --> 01:03:34,910
Why?

692
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:41,519
Let's do a thorough examination once a year as the doctor said

693
01:03:44,121 --> 01:03:45,183
I see

694
01:03:46,441 --> 01:03:48,589
It's just in the case

695
01:03:51,347 --> 01:03:52,738
OK I get it

696
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,848
But I worry

697
01:03:57,083 --> 01:04:00,536
you're fine so don't worry

698
01:04:06,321 --> 01:04:07,290
Take care

699
01:04:16,197 --> 01:04:19,619
I was relieved that you were fine

700
01:04:19,674 --> 01:04:23,635
From the beginning you told me not to worry

701
01:04:24,096 --> 01:04:26,252
Yes but

702
01:04:26,955 --> 01:04:29,166
You are right but

703
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:41,446
to be honest i was worried

704
01:04:41,587 --> 01:04:42,360
For what?

705
01:04:42,454 --> 01:04:43,571
About Detailed examination

706
01:04:45,634 --> 01:04:49,219
I was worried that you had some bad disease

707
01:04:50,805 --> 01:04:51,852
Is that so?

708
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:53,680
I can't say that in front of you

709
01:04:54,719 --> 01:05:00,352
I was really happy when Dr. Tezuka didn't worry about us.

710
01:05:09,813 --> 01:05:12,454
today is such a wonderful day!

711
01:05:13,376 --> 01:05:17,555
Let's take a break from work, eat, and go to a concert.

712
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,153
how is her sick?

713
01:05:24,309 --> 01:05:28,856
She went to Dr. Tezuka's for a thorough examination.

714
01:05:30,145 --> 01:05:31,020
So?

715
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,608
it was the same as my diagnosis

716
01:05:38,261 --> 01:05:42,995
So her brain tumor is getting worse

717
01:05:52,193 --> 01:06:01,702
After consulting with Dr.Tetsuka, I decided not to tell the truth.

718
01:06:02,983 --> 01:06:05,163
I also worried about my husband Sugano

719
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:11,101
i lied to them

720
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:15,147
I see.
how was he?

721
01:06:15,843 --> 01:06:17,460
He was so glad

722
01:06:21,994 --> 01:06:27,377
Does he find it difficult for him to make a facial expression in front of his wife.but He was so glad

723
01:06:28,747 --> 01:06:33,254
How long can Yoko live?

724
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:42,111
Until next spring when the cherry blossoms are beautiful

725
01:06:44,152 --> 01:06:45,848
cherry blossoms season...

726
01:08:22,666 --> 01:08:25,416
Let's have a wedding anniversary party together next spring

727
01:08:25,963 --> 01:08:29,893
we should thank our friends

728
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:35,266
It must be cherry blossom season

729
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,680
Later

730
01:08:45,102 --> 01:08:47,704
Spring's come

731
01:08:49,987 --> 01:08:50,612
Dr.

732
01:08:51,979 --> 01:08:53,808
It's been a age

733
01:08:54,409 --> 01:08:55,300
Are you coming too?

734
01:08:56,675 --> 01:08:57,909
I've been invited

735
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:13,188
The cherry blossoms have bloomed

736
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,953
Please come in

737
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,461
Welcome!

738
01:09:19,636 --> 01:09:22,113
Please make yourself at home

739
01:09:23,402 --> 01:09:25,308
Welcome

740
01:09:26,444 --> 01:09:28,608
where is she?

741
01:09:29,272 --> 01:09:31,554
What is she doing?
Hey,Yoko

742
01:09:32,702 --> 01:09:33,272
Yoko?

743
01:09:33,929 --> 01:09:35,186
What's wrong?

744
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:39,194
she is dressing up

745
01:09:39,421 --> 01:09:39,975
She needs my help?

746
01:09:40,069 --> 01:09:40,874
I'm going

747
01:09:45,135 --> 01:09:47,080
you look very difficult

748
01:09:53,238 --> 01:09:54,949
Sorry to have kept you wait

749
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:03,481
You are very beautiful

750
01:10:06,418 --> 01:10:07,637
Welcome

751
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:15,469
I'm sorry for being so rude

752
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,383
Thanks to you she became very well

753
01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:19,492
That's good for you

754
01:10:20,188 --> 01:10:21,742
You became very well too

755
01:10:22,211 --> 01:10:26,875
i want to hear you play the piano

756
01:10:27,063 --> 01:10:28,117
I can't

757
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,735
Please play the piano

758
01:10:31,196 --> 01:10:33,367
Please

759
01:10:36,413 --> 01:10:38,077
Oh my god

760
01:10:44,059 --> 01:10:48,106
I wonder if I can play well.
My fingers are not feeling well these days.

761
01:11:38,117 --> 01:11:42,672
she is so beautiful,right?

762
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,375
Look at her fingers

763
01:12:42,919 --> 01:12:46,833
i can't believe she is seriously ill

764
01:12:47,489 --> 01:12:55,078
I think there's something in her body that's stopping the disease from progressing.

765
01:12:56,656 --> 01:12:58,461
I can't say anything

766
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:03,406
If so, it's a miracle

767
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:04,961
it's a miracle

768
01:13:05,430 --> 01:13:08,914
that's the power of their love

769
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,524
Even doctors don't know

770
01:13:31,736 --> 01:13:32,510
Sugano

771
01:13:33,525 --> 01:13:35,150
Phone call from your wife

772
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:37,072
Thanks

773
01:13:43,527 --> 01:13:45,628
Hi,it's me

774
01:13:46,644 --> 01:13:48,878
Mitsuharu..I am..

775
01:13:48,903 --> 01:13:50,363
You sounds bad

776
01:13:50,878 --> 01:13:52,894
i have a headache

777
01:13:53,269 --> 01:13:57,605
and my one hand is numb

778
01:14:00,537 --> 01:14:04,162
i have a headache

779
01:14:05,982 --> 01:14:07,545
Are you OK?

780
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:08,568
What's wrong?

781
01:14:10,255 --> 01:14:11,536
Mitsuharu.

782
01:14:12,981 --> 01:14:15,388
Yoko!

783
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:47,045
I wanna see Dr.Oki

784
01:14:47,123 --> 01:14:48,810
he is in surgery

785
01:14:48,849 --> 01:14:51,709
Dr.Oki see her health

786
01:14:56,162 --> 01:14:57,303
Which room?

787
01:14:57,328 --> 01:14:58,084
No.8

788
01:14:58,109 --> 01:14:59,795
That room is currently occupied by another patient.

789
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,186
No. we transferred him

790
01:15:09,168 --> 01:15:10,473
prepare for blood transfusion

791
01:15:17,797 --> 01:15:18,680
breathing is weak

792
01:15:19,016 --> 01:15:21,313
Give me Mitakan

793
01:15:34,415 --> 01:15:34,993
how is her blood pressure

794
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:35,735
It doesn't go up

795
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,079
Add to Karinigen

796
01:17:28,351 --> 01:17:33,140
When her father wanted to build her grave here, I objected.

797
01:17:34,134 --> 01:17:39,134
I wanted to build her grave in Tokyo.
But I'm glad they made it here

798
01:17:39,868 --> 01:17:42,532
this is a very good place for her

799
01:17:43,470 --> 01:17:48,040
Actually, that was Yoko's intention.

800
01:17:50,343 --> 01:17:51,062
Really?

801
01:17:53,929 --> 01:17:56,539
she wanted to build her grave here

802
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:01,304
when did she say that?

803
01:18:01,773 --> 01:18:05,695
this might not be telling you

804
01:18:06,632 --> 01:18:10,390
she visited me before you got married

805
01:18:11,281 --> 01:18:15,546
The two of us came here to visit a grave

806
01:18:17,103 --> 01:18:22,532
She said she wanted to enter this tomb when she died.

807
01:18:23,736 --> 01:18:30,095
i told her i will die before you

808
01:18:30,892 --> 01:18:33,728
we laughed together

809
01:18:35,759 --> 01:18:40,814
That night I woke up in the middle of the night

810
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:43,759
Yoko was not at home

811
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:51,771
i couldn't understand anything

812
01:18:53,474 --> 01:19:00,943
I think she knew she wouldn't live long

813
01:19:06,834 --> 01:19:10,905
she was very kind to me

814
01:19:11,444 --> 01:19:14,233
she looks different

815
01:19:35,617 --> 01:19:42,172
It's hard to feel the reality of someone's death

816
01:19:45,801 --> 01:19:49,270
i think she is still alive

817
01:19:51,418 --> 01:19:52,614
I still can't believe

818
01:19:54,012 --> 01:19:55,301
I understand

819
01:19:57,129 --> 01:20:05,848
How did she know she couldn't live long

820
01:20:07,286 --> 01:20:08,778
She knew it?

821
01:20:10,505 --> 01:20:13,841
Yes. she knew..I don't know since when

822
01:20:48,254 --> 01:20:49,394
Welcome back

823
01:20:49,715 --> 01:20:50,394
I'm home

824
01:20:51,691 --> 01:20:54,894
It's hot,right?
You are sweating

825
01:20:55,551 --> 01:20:56,238
Bath is ready?

826
01:20:56,496 --> 01:20:58,152
Yes, it's ready

827
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:03,411
It seems that Mr. Fujikawa had another fight with his wife.

828
01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:05,028
Again?

829
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:10,521
But he said their kids will support her so I can't win

830
01:21:16,780 --> 01:21:18,077
i bought a goldfish

831
01:21:18,553 --> 01:21:19,827
So cute

832
01:21:20,303 --> 01:21:21,748
The goldfish I bought last year died.

833
01:22:36,335 --> 01:22:41,929
Good evening.
You went home, but you didn't answer, so I was stumped.

834
01:22:42,460 --> 01:22:44,116
This dress was delivered by cleaning

835
01:22:44,413 --> 01:22:48,062
I paid for your newspaper out of the money you gave me.

836
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:49,239
Thanks

837
01:22:49,411 --> 01:22:51,465
Not at all

838
01:22:53,137 --> 01:22:55,419
You have a hard time

839
01:23:02,206 --> 01:23:06,800
I have been wondering about something for a while now.

840
01:23:08,659 --> 01:23:13,878
I was here last year chatting with your wife.

841
01:23:14,691 --> 01:23:18,011
I told her about my mother dying of cancer

842
01:23:19,777 --> 01:23:25,659
I was surprised that your wife died

843
01:23:26,175 --> 01:23:29,394
I regret ever telling her about it.

844
01:23:30,097 --> 01:23:35,980
Your wife didn't mind, but I feel very bad for her.

845
01:23:37,050 --> 01:23:40,995
i shouldn't have said that

846
01:23:41,886 --> 01:23:43,480
I'm really sorry

847
01:23:44,589 --> 01:23:48,378
Don't worry.
she died without knowing anything

848
01:23:50,177 --> 01:23:53,474
I feel a little better

849
01:23:54,935 --> 01:23:58,083
i wanted to tell you about this

850
01:23:59,442 --> 01:24:01,724
Excuse me

851
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,314
Madam

852
01:24:06,298 --> 01:24:07,830
when was it last year?

853
01:24:08,470 --> 01:24:09,447
In autumn

854
01:24:10,681 --> 01:24:14,150
I came here to bring sweets in September

855
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:16,196
I see

856
01:24:27,123 --> 01:24:28,764
i got surprised

857
01:24:31,647 --> 01:24:34,022
You are childish

858
01:24:37,278 --> 01:24:38,668
were you surprised?

859
01:25:07,424 --> 01:25:09,939
She read this

860
01:25:10,846 --> 01:25:14,057
she read this before i came home

861
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:21,757
I put this book on the bottom.
I never put this book at the top

862
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,945
She put this book on the top

863
01:25:54,585 --> 01:25:55,187
Yoko

864
01:25:57,898 --> 01:25:58,898
Yoko

865
01:26:06,015 --> 01:26:06,742
Yoko

866
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:23,117
Yoko

867
01:26:33,008 --> 01:26:33,656
Yoko

868
01:26:39,733 --> 01:26:42,537
You knew that

869
01:26:44,922 --> 01:26:52,781
You knew that when you went to the spring party and the concert.

870
01:26:55,329 --> 01:26:58,657
Why you didn't tell me?

871
01:27:05,817 --> 01:27:09,020
i wanted to tell you the truth

872
01:27:09,942 --> 01:27:15,106
I thought I'd tell you everything until the day you died

873
01:27:16,382 --> 01:27:19,265
i really wanted to tell you everything

874
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:26,820
I had a hard time.
You had a hard time too

875
01:27:29,022 --> 01:27:30,874
Why you didn't tell me?

876
01:27:32,217 --> 01:27:36,022
we wanted to suffer together

877
01:27:36,686 --> 01:27:38,295
it makes us happy

878
01:27:42,091 --> 01:27:47,919
You thought I would be satisfied if you died knowing nothing?

879
01:27:48,509 --> 01:27:51,993
I think it's too selfish

880
01:27:59,177 --> 01:28:00,154
What should I do?

881
01:28:01,802 --> 01:28:03,755
I can't take it back

882
01:28:21,247 --> 01:28:21,739
Yoko

883
01:28:24,948 --> 01:28:25,487
Yoko

884
01:28:27,542 --> 01:28:28,362
Yoko

885
01:28:32,832 --> 01:28:33,692
Yoko

886
01:28:35,832 --> 01:28:36,152
Yoko

887
01:28:37,895 --> 01:28:38,551
Yoko

888
01:28:43,426 --> 01:28:45,004
What's wrong?

889
01:28:46,356 --> 01:28:52,754
You has gone from my home

890
01:28:55,403 --> 01:28:58,473
Please stay strong

891
01:29:00,004 --> 01:29:02,074
You were just dreaming

892
01:29:06,219 --> 01:29:10,515
I don't care if it's a dream

893
01:29:11,359 --> 01:29:18,685
She came to see me once again.

894
01:30:01,828 --> 01:30:08,921
THE END

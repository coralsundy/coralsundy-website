2
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:59,916
Okay.
Well, I'll be in touch later.

3
00:01:00,214 --> 00:01:08,141
Is it okay if I call you at that late hour?
Thank you. Excuse me.

4
00:01:53,984 --> 00:01:54,797
Thank you.

5
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,353
Did you catch the last bullet train?

6
00:02:00,548 --> 00:02:01,201
Yes.

7
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,141
Have you decided on a place to stay?

8
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:06,214
No.
I just thought I'd walk around.

9
00:02:06,378 --> 00:02:08,165
What are you talking about?

10
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,286
It's too cold.
You'll go to die.

11
00:02:12,127 --> 00:02:14,494
I'll go to die?

12
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,494
Is this an old inn?

13
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:38,680
You don't like it?
There's only one in Yuzawa.

14
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:40,902
We left it just the way it was.

15
00:02:41,509 --> 00:02:45,923
I like it.
I've decided on the top of the house, the third floor.

16
00:02:48,348 --> 00:02:49,622
He's not back yet?

17
00:02:50,332 --> 00:02:55,339
Call me when he back, 83201911.

18
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,135
Take your time.

19
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,415
Tell him to call me.

20
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:05,269
I'm Ukiko Kawamura.

21
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:24,469
Excuse me.

22
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:25,031
<i>Hako Kirameku Hate / Beyond the Shining Sea (1986)</i>

23
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:29,733
Visiting?

24
00:05:30,614 --> 00:05:32,474
Is Tsuguro here?

25
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:54,198
My brother is out right now.
He's not here.

26
00:05:56,546 --> 00:05:58,553
I wonder where I can find him.

27
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,097
I'm Kawamura...

28
00:06:00,517 --> 00:06:01,757
Let's go.

29
00:06:05,415 --> 00:06:07,622
I'm so sorry.
You are  his sister,right?

30
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:13,060
You can't just barge in here like that.

31
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:16,769
People are watching us, and workers are listening.

32
00:06:17,637 --> 00:06:18,710
I'm embarrassed.

33
00:06:21,106 --> 00:06:24,520
My brother is taking his friend to the slopes right now.

34
00:06:24,988 --> 00:06:26,054
Please go home.

35
00:06:26,758 --> 00:06:27,865
Which ski resort?

36
00:06:29,753 --> 00:06:32,173
Joetsu Kokusai in Osawa.

37
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:35,385
I'm sorry to bother you.

38
00:06:37,255 --> 00:06:38,435
Are you going to Osawa?

39
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:41,381
Yeah, just to take a look.

40
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:46,311
I told him about the phone call, but he said he didn't want to see you.

41
00:06:48,165 --> 00:06:52,178
But he called the inn later.

42
00:06:53,124 --> 00:06:54,857
It was something wrong.

43
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,055
Good-bye.

44
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:18,725
I'd like to call for a guest.

45
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:24,713
Mr. Imaizumi from Shiozawa.

46
00:07:25,558 --> 00:07:29,084
If you are here, please come to the hotel lift.

47
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,305
Excuse me.

48
00:08:55,478 --> 00:08:56,071
Yes.

49
00:09:01,897 --> 00:09:04,831
You look so nice.

50
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:07,621
Your friends are coming.

51
00:09:08,086 --> 00:09:10,066
He's coming, for sure.

52
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:11,873
Can I ask you a favor?

53
00:09:14,364 --> 00:09:15,917
Are you drunk?

54
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,518
I feel good...

55
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,822
I need you to deliver this.

56
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,555
A letter?

57
00:09:24,892 --> 00:09:25,872
To hotel?

58
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,211
To Shiozawa.

59
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:32,241
There's a house behind the Reverend Suzuki Memorial Museum called Imaizumi.

60
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,912
Yes there is.

61
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:37,699
Tsuguro at the house.

62
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:39,277
I know of him.

63
00:09:39,587 --> 00:09:41,981
He's the second son who went to Tokyo.

64
00:09:44,512 --> 00:09:53,295
He got into a prestigious firm, went to New York or something.
But he got fired because of his girl problems.

65
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:57,307
I quit the company because of this.

66
00:10:20,609 --> 00:10:23,809
I'm going to bed.

67
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:29,691
Good night.

68
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,625
You don't have to answer her.

69
00:10:42,677 --> 00:10:44,244
Excuse me.

70
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:46,035
Hold on.

71
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:48,389
This is not a good way.

72
00:11:01,551 --> 00:11:02,231
Pills?

73
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:05,791
What kind of pills? Sleeping pills or something?

74
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,134
What was she like?

75
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:17,277
She's in her white pajamas, drunk and feeling good.

76
00:11:20,068 --> 00:11:25,288
She's asleep and waiting for you.
I took a few pills, so there's no rush.

77
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:29,466
May you be at my bedside when I wake up.

78
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:30,635
Ukiko.

79
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:35,388
A little bit of medicine... that mean she's going to kill herself.

80
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,710
I'm in trouble.

81
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:40,158
I'll call you.
tell me your number.

82
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,249
Don't do that.
If you call, you're gonna be a part of this.

83
00:11:45,234 --> 00:11:46,027
Excuse me.

84
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,623
She's completely sleeping.

85
00:11:55,669 --> 00:11:59,062
She won't wake up at all.

86
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:00,939
Police...

87
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,520
I'd better to call police.

88
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:07,597
Calm down.

89
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:11,256
Call a doctor first.
Call Dr.Fujimaki.

90
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:17,072
She might be kidding.
Don't tell anyone about this.

91
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:19,109
Don't make a fuss!

92
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:22,417
What's the hell?

93
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,669
She's so serious.

94
00:12:26,053 --> 00:12:27,560
She's going to kill herself?

95
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:28,873
Don't go.

96
00:12:29,257 --> 00:12:31,150
It's none of your business.

97
00:12:32,362 --> 00:12:34,295
This is a matter of life and death.

98
00:12:34,397 --> 00:12:35,544
Stay away from her.

99
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:40,407
Don't get involved with her and you won't even be here.

100
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,673
Should we pretend we don't know?

101
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:45,750
He does not know of her?

102
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,170
Shut up!

103
00:12:47,527 --> 00:12:48,874
I'm thinking...

104
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,483
Are you Hirono?

105
00:13:27,657 --> 00:13:28,717
Thanks for coming all the way out here.

106
00:13:29,189 --> 00:13:31,729
Is Imaizumi here?

107
00:13:31,984 --> 00:13:36,437
He's not here.

108
00:13:40,132 --> 00:13:46,413
I remember she washed out her stomach and took out everything she drank.
The doctor said she would be cured after another day and night of sleep.

109
00:13:46,961 --> 00:13:50,179
I don't wanna see her.

110
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:55,086
I came here to be responsible for her face if she die.

111
00:13:55,281 --> 00:14:01,539
Don't say that.
You said you broke up, but you were married with her at one time.

112
00:14:04,656 --> 00:14:08,632
I'm in a very difficult position.

113
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,259
Don't look at me.

114
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:45,233
Her mother's coming.

115
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:49,678
I called her before I left Tokyo.
She's coming from Tsushima.

116
00:14:50,811 --> 00:14:53,015
It's too far.

117
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:59,624
She can fly in and take the Shinkansen from Ueno and she will arrive before the evening from now on.

118
00:15:08,969 --> 00:15:12,945
Where is the Nishijin ryokan located?

119
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,985
It's at the west exit.
Behind the station.

120
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:20,422
Thank you very much.
Give me this.

121
00:15:38,599 --> 00:15:40,107
Toru.

122
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,802
She's alive.

123
00:15:43,607 --> 00:15:45,200
She's sleeping peacefully.

124
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:52,302
I see.
Snow country is warmer than I thought.

125
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,490
She's alive.

126
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:00,183
Excuse me.

127
00:16:02,871 --> 00:16:06,387
Imaizumi was not here.

128
00:16:08,816 --> 00:16:12,324
Tell her when she wake up.

129
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:38,149
These are delicious!

130
00:16:38,454 --> 00:16:43,571
Glutinous rice is the real thing, you want some?

131
00:16:46,524 --> 00:16:48,446
Can I sleep a little longer?

132
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:51,063
Go ahead.

133
00:16:51,712 --> 00:16:53,595
Get well soon.

134
00:17:19,485 --> 00:17:20,235
Mom.

135
00:17:20,946 --> 00:17:25,407
You are a pathetic woman.

136
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:30,516
It's really stupid to be with a young man like that.

137
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:39,016
In the end, he didn't come and just delivered the money to his sister here.

138
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,579
He delivered just 100,000 yen.

139
00:17:44,774 --> 00:17:53,712
You are already 30 years old.
You were dumped by your husband and went out with a younger man.

140
00:17:55,469 --> 00:17:58,688
I'm so frustrated.

141
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:02,704
Your life is trash.

142
00:18:03,532 --> 00:18:08,040
You'd be better off just dying like this.

143
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,266
No way.

144
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:13,040
I didn't mean that.

145
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:18,998
You can't what?

146
00:18:23,896 --> 00:18:29,794
Let's go back to the island together and live

147
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,439
I still have a headache.

148
00:18:39,064 --> 00:18:46,291
Living on a small island might not be so bad.

149
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:49,400
You're not child anymore.

150
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:54,120
Your brother is waiting at the restaurant.

151
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,901
Mom, I'm going for a walk.

152
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:00,417
I'm trying to figure out how to say hello.

153
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,210
Hello.

154
00:20:42,607 --> 00:20:45,365
Shota.
How did you know it was here?

155
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:49,585
I heard you're in a high place.

156
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,077
Thank you very much.

157
00:20:51,468 --> 00:20:53,655
You've grown up.

158
00:20:53,858 --> 00:20:56,007
I saw you two years ago.

159
00:20:56,272 --> 00:20:58,647
How long are you going to be here?

160
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:00,936
You'll have to stay with Grandpa's family.

161
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:07,975
I don't remember such a big broadcast.

162
00:21:08,054 --> 00:21:11,288
This is music at 6pm, and it's different music in the morning and at night.

163
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:14,116
What song is the morning one?

164
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:16,093
Well.

165
00:21:16,118 --> 00:21:16,741
Tell me.

166
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:22,655
The song like this.

167
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,707
Are you still there?

168
00:22:32,379 --> 00:22:36,801
That was supposed to be the 4:00 ferry.
Our father left with that intention, too.

169
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:40,840
Can you visit me?

170
00:22:42,137 --> 00:22:44,527
I've got some more work to do.

171
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,863
I need to go?

172
00:22:57,769 --> 00:22:59,027
I get it.

173
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:17,011
Sorry I'm late.

174
00:23:17,636 --> 00:23:20,808
Shota said he went to Grandpa's first.

175
00:23:24,206 --> 00:23:25,862
Auntie, it's been a while.

176
00:23:28,112 --> 00:23:35,558
Last time you came, you were with your husband.
Is he fine?

177
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:38,526
Yes.

178
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:42,433
Take your time.

179
00:24:05,093 --> 00:24:13,437
I'm sorry to inform you that I've caused something stupid and I'm going to be taken care of by you.

180
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,718
Please accept my best regards.

181
00:24:22,343 --> 00:24:26,312
I've just seen the sunset sea here.

182
00:24:35,093 --> 00:24:35,890
Bros.

183
00:24:41,374 --> 00:24:42,202
Ok.

184
00:24:44,335 --> 00:24:53,561
If your voice sounded muffled, clingy, or pathetic...
I would not have let you in the house.

185
00:24:54,405 --> 00:24:55,687
Well, thank you.

186
00:24:56,327 --> 00:25:03,624
I'm relieved.
You look nice.

187
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:08,423
Let's live together.

188
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:16,759
If he wasn't good, we were going to kick you out.

189
00:25:17,118 --> 00:25:22,790
You saved my life.
If you'd gotten rid of me, I'd have jumped into the ocean this time.

190
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,798
What's the hell?

191
00:25:28,142 --> 00:25:32,954
You haven't changed since you were in college.

192
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:38,611
Anyway have a meal.

193
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:46,392
Eat fish, breathe in the sea air, and your blood and body fluids are replaced with pure water.

194
00:25:52,465 --> 00:25:53,847
It tastes good?

195
00:25:55,199 --> 00:26:01,363
When you're alive, the first thing that comes to your mind is how good food tastes.
That's happiness.

196
00:26:01,738 --> 00:26:04,207
Then what will be the next happiness?

197
00:26:04,232 --> 00:26:10,644
That's what Ukiko came to find out.

198
00:26:16,789 --> 00:26:20,898
The word “rough” is written “rough” in the kinetic word “rough

199
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:25,984
Is this fish really that scary?

200
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:29,789
This fish doesn't move all day.

201
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:34,195
I feel sorry for him.

202
00:26:36,086 --> 00:26:38,961
I'll bring this tank when an important guest comes.

203
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:42,601
I am taking care of this fish.

204
00:26:42,828 --> 00:26:47,375
You gonna eat this fish?

205
00:26:53,546 --> 00:26:54,976
Hiroko.

206
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:07,851
Why didn't you call me before you came?

207
00:27:10,109 --> 00:27:11,890
What's the hell?

208
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:20,632
But that is how you are.

209
00:27:21,241 --> 00:27:23,890
You are very stubborn.

210
00:27:23,984 --> 00:27:24,906
Bros.

211
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:32,601
Her personality is completely different from Ukiko's.

212
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:37,515
Dad, you're comparing me to Uki.

213
00:27:38,453 --> 00:27:42,835
Now that you compared me to Hiroko, I'm a zero.
I'm less than zero.

214
00:27:43,554 --> 00:27:44,937
Oh no.

215
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:50,742
This was my room before I was married.

216
00:27:50,976 --> 00:27:54,062
I thought the bed would be better, so I cleaned it up.

217
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,707
I'm sorry... to thank you for everything.

218
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,184
Thank you very much.

219
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:12,551
Since my father collapsed, you've been taking care of him, and you've been a big help for me.

220
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:23,488
I understand you've been through a lot.
It must have been hard for you.

221
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,746
I know how you feel.

222
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:57,414
Good evening.
I've come to pick you up.

223
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:01,664
Oh, Mr. Atsumi?
Please, come in.

224
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,469
It will be a long journey.

225
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:09,805
We have prepared a meal for you.
Come in.

226
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:11,516
Hiroko.

227
00:29:25,343 --> 00:29:27,702
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

228
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,103
Hiroko.

229
00:29:40,657 --> 00:29:44,110
Did you really not want to see her face?

230
00:29:47,103 --> 00:29:48,165
I know.

231
00:29:49,314 --> 00:29:54,814
Since you didn't have any work, you worked overtime and then killed time at a coffee shop.

232
00:29:55,907 --> 00:29:58,821
I didn't know how to greet.

233
00:30:00,196 --> 00:30:02,501
You were good just the way you were.

234
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,415
I can't.

235
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:10,821
What happened to that bright, innocent person she used to be?

236
00:30:12,953 --> 00:30:16,914
Do you remember?
We used to go to the beach in the summer with her and her husband.

237
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,675
Tsukue Island?

238
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,747
We went on a boat.

239
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:27,514
There were only us.

240
00:30:27,973 --> 00:30:33,020
It's been a little while since Shota was born... seven years ago, I think.

241
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:42,849
We were returning to the pier after a day of play.
Ukiko suddenly said she had to pee.

242
00:30:44,853 --> 00:30:45,766
Oh yeah.

243
00:30:46,268 --> 00:30:49,221
I pulled her hand and told her to go to the grass.

244
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:54,111
She walked right into the water right in front of us.

245
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:57,090
She sat down.

246
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:06,552
She was so close, I could hear the sound of pee.

247
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,793
She seemed to be embarrassed.

248
00:31:09,622 --> 00:31:12,808
She laughed about how great it was to pee in the ocean.

249
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,120
I was so envious of Uki back then, she was so carefree.

250
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:22,788
She said it was thrilling, like having her ass licked by a whisper.

251
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,940
May I have some?

252
00:32:02,555 --> 00:32:05,588
Our dad are too glad.
I kind of worry.

253
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:13,863
He'll show you how he can change Uki by himself.

254
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,565
No matter what you do, human nature will never change

255
00:32:30,497 --> 00:32:33,550
We can't do this.
Uki has just arrived.

256
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:44,239
Stop it....

257
00:33:08,646 --> 00:33:09,753
Where are you going?

258
00:33:10,525 --> 00:33:11,812
To the fish market.

259
00:33:12,067 --> 00:33:15,727
I heard that fish from all the fishing ports gather here at the market.

260
00:33:15,877 --> 00:33:17,738
Don't go there.

261
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:22,651
It's not a place for people like you to hang around.

262
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:25,647
What do you mean?

263
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:33,972
As long as you live here, there are certain things you must refrain from.

264
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:37,237
By “refrain” do you mean forbid?

265
00:33:37,326 --> 00:33:39,272
Yes,that's it.

266
00:33:40,313 --> 00:33:44,920
Do not walk the streets in your house clothes.
No loitering around aimlessly.

267
00:33:46,175 --> 00:33:48,508
Do not behave in a conspicuous manner

268
00:33:50,114 --> 00:33:51,214
Is that all?

269
00:33:52,353 --> 00:33:53,966
And one more.

270
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,979
Do not contact past acquaintances by phone, letter, etc.

271
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,588
You have to keep up with them at least.

272
00:34:03,478 --> 00:34:06,038
Are you saying that you are doing this like a fish?

273
00:34:06,084 --> 00:34:09,884
I won't ask how it happened.

274
00:34:10,789 --> 00:34:17,689
It's not a good idea for a person who is a homemaker to fornicate with another man.

275
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:24,420
You have extra time to waste, you do it.

276
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:26,430
OK.

277
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:32,416
You, however, end up having secret times, secret actions.

278
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:35,562
And the result of that is that you end up in trouble with a young man.

279
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:40,850
Something like that.

280
00:34:42,058 --> 00:34:44,898
That's what I think.

281
00:34:46,193 --> 00:34:47,200
I get it.

282
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,447
I'm sure that's all that matters to you.

283
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:01,350
The coldness of your hands

284
00:35:25,637 --> 00:35:26,657
Excuse me.

285
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,293
Uncle.
I've found my purpose, albeit a small one.

286
00:35:37,883 --> 00:35:39,943
May I come into town?

287
00:35:41,146 --> 00:35:42,839
I don't understand a word you're saying.

288
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:46,848
I'm going to buy some inconspicuous everyday clothes.

289
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,292
That's good.

290
00:35:49,337 --> 00:35:53,704
I also found some of Hiroko's old oil painting tools.

291
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:57,054
So I want to buy some paints and brushes.

292
00:35:57,171 --> 00:35:59,716
Do you do oil paintings?

293
00:36:00,474 --> 00:36:01,607
I have no idea.

294
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,918
Maybe I'll paint my uncle's face one of these days.

295
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:06,886
I'm going to go now.

296
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:07,957
Hold on.

297
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:16,824
I'm off to the weekly Saturday town council meeting in half an hour.
Come with me.

298
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:24,281
There is not a single house or factory in this area.

299
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,961
Not a single yakuza out of a population of 41,000.

300
00:36:28,694 --> 00:36:31,287
Really?
Not even a gang of yakuza?

301
00:36:31,312 --> 00:36:36,644
They always fought them off at the water's edge and never let them take a step ashore.

302
00:36:38,127 --> 00:36:39,714
It's as if you fought them.

303
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:41,873
I fought them.

304
00:36:45,486 --> 00:36:48,873
After I work in Kyoto,

305
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,683
I worked at a youth office in Nagasaki Prefecture.

306
00:36:56,596 --> 00:36:59,236
It was hard work.

307
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:03,500
Thanks for taking care of them.

308
00:37:19,751 --> 00:37:20,484
Welcome.

309
00:39:01,741 --> 00:39:02,721
That's what I thought.
You are here.

310
00:39:06,818 --> 00:39:08,845
You work here?

311
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:14,265
I hear strange woman is watching our student.

312
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:20,477
You don't feel comfortable to live?

313
00:39:21,254 --> 00:39:24,007
Well, we've made our peace with it.

314
00:39:24,733 --> 00:39:27,000
He let me out for shopping or something.

315
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:30,146
I can show you around if you like.
By car.

316
00:39:30,511 --> 00:39:31,277
For a change.

317
00:39:32,261 --> 00:39:34,195
Are you sure you want to do that?

318
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:36,356
You worry about your uncle?

319
00:39:36,849 --> 00:39:37,629
No.

320
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,679
You didn't say anything to me when I got there.
I think you were trying to avoid me.

321
00:39:48,301 --> 00:39:52,008
That's because if I said anything...
I would've said something really strong.

322
00:39:53,027 --> 00:39:54,614
What do you mean, “something strong”?

323
00:39:57,338 --> 00:40:00,484
Where would you like to go? Anywhere you want to see.

324
00:40:01,892 --> 00:40:02,832
Well.

325
00:40:03,716 --> 00:40:11,572
I already know about the setting sun, so where the sun rises.
If that's not possible, I'd like to go to the cape to the east of you.

326
00:40:12,407 --> 00:40:14,147
You miss the mainland already?

327
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,573
I don't think so.

328
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:03,906
Hello? This is Omi.

329
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,196
It's me.

330
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:09,822
Are you sure?

331
00:41:15,138 --> 00:41:16,444
Yes I know.

332
00:41:18,472 --> 00:41:19,998
Who was it?

333
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:23,756
My friend from Hakata is here.

334
00:41:48,471 --> 00:41:51,457
I lied to my mother and came out.

335
00:41:52,912 --> 00:41:55,039
It can't be helped. Your uncle is very strict.

336
00:41:56,071 --> 00:41:59,658
How about you with Hiroko?

337
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:05,705
I didn't say anything.
I go straight away from school.

338
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:37,873
I wonder which way the sun rises?

339
00:42:38,955 --> 00:42:40,642
That area is east.

340
00:42:41,637 --> 00:42:43,585
Have you ever seen a sunrise?

341
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:43,885
No.

342
00:42:45,325 --> 00:42:46,465
Hakata is that way.

343
00:42:48,408 --> 00:42:51,441
Can we see Higashimatsuura Peninsula today?

344
00:42:53,831 --> 00:42:55,371
Let's go further out.

345
00:42:56,268 --> 00:42:57,701
Watch out.

346
00:42:58,719 --> 00:42:59,492
Don't worry.

347
00:43:02,122 --> 00:43:03,209
Watch out.

348
00:43:13,912 --> 00:43:14,818
You scared me.

349
00:43:15,272 --> 00:43:15,978
Why?

350
00:43:19,069 --> 00:43:20,729
You thought I'd jump in?

351
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:23,821
No.

352
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:02,969
Is this screen cliff?

353
00:44:03,569 --> 00:44:05,602
No.
Sakyobana.

354
00:44:06,214 --> 00:44:09,868
Oh, why? That cliff looks like a folding screen.

355
00:44:10,136 --> 00:44:11,489
You see, it's a black folding screen.

356
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,266
But it's not.

357
00:44:20,739 --> 00:44:22,459
Oh, it's beautiful.

358
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:26,929
The only time I get to do this is on Saturday afternoons when my uncle's not around.

359
00:44:27,783 --> 00:44:28,837
Here it is.

360
00:44:29,976 --> 00:44:30,743
screen cliff

361
00:44:31,243 --> 00:44:32,216
Where?

362
00:44:33,345 --> 00:44:36,405
That white cliff.
I'm pretty sure it's because it's crumbling in the middle.

363
00:44:37,179 --> 00:44:38,305
Are you sure?

364
00:44:39,205 --> 00:44:41,832
It's kind of disappointing, isn't it?

365
00:44:42,795 --> 00:44:49,035
But what's interesting is that the fossil from there is apparently a freshwater fish.

366
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:51,483
right in the middle of the ocean?

367
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:52,342
Yeah.

368
00:44:53,107 --> 00:45:04,614
An American paleontologist discovered it in Taisho,
He named the fish Ikius nipponicus after a living creature.

369
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:06,795
Ikius nipponicus?

370
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:14,576
It's like being a Japanese living on a living island, just like Atsumi.

371
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,615
People try to avoid me.

372
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:26,983
No, they don't.
I'm not like that.

373
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:31,561
I'm a teacher.
My father is a teacher too.

374
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,881
My wife's father is a teacher too.

375
00:45:35,451 --> 00:45:42,725
On this island, retired teachers...
They all buy boats and go fishing every day while living off their benefits.

376
00:45:44,612 --> 00:45:46,557
That's where I'm headed

377
00:45:49,612 --> 00:45:55,409
To someone like that, you seem like you're from another world.

378
00:45:57,268 --> 00:46:00,854
You do what you want, when you want, wherever you want.

379
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:10,057
I don't know how to put it.
You always make me feel like I'm in a good mood.

380
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,862
And I betrayed it myself?

381
00:46:17,104 --> 00:46:19,347
Yes you did.

382
00:46:20,643 --> 00:46:22,276
You have betrayed us in a way that cannot be undone.

383
00:46:29,026 --> 00:46:30,511
That's all.

384
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:34,300
I said, in my strangely logical, teacherly way.

385
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:41,862
You haven't changed.

386
00:46:43,136 --> 00:46:46,557
You think so?

387
00:46:49,136 --> 00:46:51,722
I'm glad I came with you today.

388
00:46:54,276 --> 00:46:55,237
Thank you.

389
00:46:57,643 --> 00:47:01,284
I feel like I have an ally for the first time.

390
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:03,987
Ally?

391
00:47:07,862 --> 00:47:09,401
What would you do for me?

392
00:47:09,909 --> 00:47:11,214
What do you want from me?

393
00:47:11,417 --> 00:47:12,823
Would you do anything for me?

394
00:47:12,886 --> 00:47:14,409
Not anything.

395
00:47:15,205 --> 00:47:16,916
I'm kidding.

396
00:47:17,073 --> 00:47:18,675
I don't need you to do anything.

397
00:47:19,682 --> 00:47:22,886
I just need to know that there's someone out there for me.
That's all I need.

398
00:47:27,989 --> 00:47:31,707
I wish I could do something for you.

399
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:32,520
It's okay.

400
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:36,793
If I can't help it, I'll become someone else's mistress.

401
00:47:36,818 --> 00:47:38,043
No.

402
00:47:39,129 --> 00:47:42,418
You should be more firm.

403
00:47:43,723 --> 00:47:45,864
You look like a schoolteacher.

404
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:49,246
I'm a teacher.

405
00:47:50,934 --> 00:47:52,293
Now too?

406
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:57,059
Yes I am.

407
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:00,801
Which part of you is a teacher?

408
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,489
Stand up straight.

409
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,278
It's important to restart your life.

410
00:52:00,942 --> 00:52:06,270
Stay strong and live on such a small island.

411
00:52:07,098 --> 00:52:09,434
People on the island think you are strange.

412
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:18,591
Uki.

413
00:52:19,106 --> 00:52:21,028
Where will you go?

414
00:52:21,114 --> 00:52:23,091
We'll go to shopping.

415
00:52:23,552 --> 00:52:26,560
Atsumi told us to go there.

416
00:52:27,764 --> 00:52:29,654
Good for you.

417
00:52:30,983 --> 00:52:31,951
Let's go together.

418
00:52:32,178 --> 00:52:34,373
Shota.
We're going..

419
00:52:40,256 --> 00:52:43,467
Their families were good friends.

420
00:56:32,979 --> 00:56:35,198
Where have you been?

421
00:56:48,727 --> 00:56:49,352
I'm home.

422
00:56:49,578 --> 00:56:50,844
Welcome home.

423
00:56:52,469 --> 00:56:53,805
Fish?

424
00:56:54,930 --> 00:57:00,180
I went with a young guy named Arai.
He's new here, and he likes to fish.

425
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:06,820
Nice turnip fish.

426
00:57:07,117 --> 00:57:09,500
it's not rare.
Please give it to our neighbors

427
00:57:09,898 --> 00:57:12,664
What a waste!
I'll take it to my uncle's house.

428
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:14,859
I told you it's not rare.

429
00:57:15,289 --> 00:57:23,202
I think I gave Uki some turnip miso soup when I was there

430
00:57:24,859 --> 00:57:28,172
I'm tried.

431
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:33,914
I'll go by scooter.
I haven't seen their faces lately.

432
00:57:43,589 --> 00:57:44,683
I'm off.

433
00:58:03,884 --> 00:58:05,071
Good evening.

434
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:08,024
Fish delivery.

435
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:09,766
They're heavy.

436
00:58:09,962 --> 00:58:11,618
They are for you.

437
00:58:11,643 --> 00:58:12,524
Thanks.

438
00:58:12,549 --> 00:58:13,126
How are you?

439
00:58:13,305 --> 00:58:14,384
I'm fine.

440
00:58:14,907 --> 00:58:17,040
This is nice fish.

441
00:58:17,072 --> 00:58:19,805
Atsumi went to sea.

442
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,790
Let's cook miso soup.

443
00:58:22,118 --> 00:58:25,477
I'll cook for you.

444
00:58:26,784 --> 00:58:32,456
In the past, when a child was born, everyone drank this miso soup.

445
00:58:33,073 --> 00:58:35,800
In other words, it's a fish for women.

446
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:58,382
Where's dad?

447
00:58:58,671 --> 00:59:01,851
He went to Saturday Council Meeting.
He'll be back soon.

448
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:03,405
Where's Atsumi?

449
00:59:04,655 --> 00:59:07,304
He went to the sea and is tired and drinking alcohol.

450
00:59:09,686 --> 00:59:10,451
My mistake.

451
00:59:19,318 --> 00:59:21,982
Did I make you feel bad?

452
00:59:22,388 --> 00:59:24,576
I'm sorry.
I feel bad.

453
00:59:41,013 --> 00:59:41,895
Dad.

454
00:59:42,677 --> 00:59:43,372
You're here.

455
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:45,606
Don't bully her.

456
00:59:46,231 --> 00:59:47,669
She's not fine.

457
00:59:47,694 --> 00:59:49,013
What?

458
00:59:51,013 --> 00:59:56,270
At first I taught her the rules, but recently she's started to recover.

459
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:58,497
She's not complaining about anything.

460
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:04,419
She seems to be a sick person.

461
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:06,606
She seems to be a sick person?

462
01:00:40,644 --> 01:00:41,886
I worry.

463
01:00:45,487 --> 01:00:46,339
Ukiko?

464
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:47,378
Yes.

465
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:51,292
Ukiko?

466
01:00:54,971 --> 01:00:56,471
Stay like that.

467
01:00:57,307 --> 01:00:59,479
I made a milk tea for you.

468
01:01:00,971 --> 01:01:04,549
You didn't even eat dinner so I was worried.

469
01:01:05,963 --> 01:01:07,042
Thanks.

470
01:01:12,303 --> 01:01:13,491
How are you feeling?

471
01:01:14,030 --> 01:01:16,616
I got better after I went to bed.

472
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:20,069
Do you see anyone?

473
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:22,139
No.

474
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:28,170
That is not pure-hearted

475
01:01:30,155 --> 01:01:31,303
What do you mean?

476
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:35,795
I'm just worried about you.
I thought you were pregnant.

477
01:01:36,623 --> 01:01:37,702
What?

478
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:44,553
That's a natural thing when a man and a woman are together.

479
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:50,358
Of course, I have no idea who that man is.

480
01:01:51,998 --> 01:01:53,780
Just in case.

481
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:59,561
I'm glad you're not like that.

482
01:02:00,733 --> 01:02:02,022
Have a drink.

483
01:02:08,117 --> 01:02:09,437
Watch out.

484
01:02:17,203 --> 01:02:20,469
Let me go to Hakata once.

485
01:02:21,883 --> 01:02:24,352
I feel like I'm suffocating in here.

486
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:29,070
Ok Go ahead.

487
01:02:52,752 --> 01:02:54,041
Kawamura.

488
01:02:59,494 --> 01:03:00,564
Shiomi.

489
01:03:01,963 --> 01:03:05,095
You looked a little different. I thought I had mistaken you for someone else.

490
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,814
Are you still in the Steel Department?

491
01:03:09,306 --> 01:03:12,486
I am currently working as a secretary.

492
01:03:13,978 --> 01:03:16,142
I thought you were in Tokyo, but you're here?

493
01:03:17,431 --> 01:03:22,181
I've been through a lot, but now I'm on the island of Iki.

494
01:03:25,088 --> 01:03:26,197
the island of Iki?

495
01:03:27,423 --> 01:03:30,158
Really?

496
01:03:36,736 --> 01:03:37,931
Four?

497
01:03:38,119 --> 01:03:38,658
Four what?

498
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:41,181
Fork fingers.

499
01:03:42,556 --> 01:03:44,939
I wonder if it's the same all over the world.

500
01:03:45,588 --> 01:03:48,463
You have a five-fingered fork?

501
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:56,775
I stare at it and the tip looks like a human fingernail.

502
01:03:56,931 --> 01:03:59,658
I'm gonna stab something with it.

503
01:04:07,439 --> 01:04:13,642
I'll scratch you with a fork

504
01:04:13,939 --> 01:04:15,486
Don't do that.

505
01:04:16,681 --> 01:04:18,916
Ok I won't.

506
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:24,439
I'll be gentle like this.

507
01:05:55,205 --> 01:05:57,650
I've never felt this way before.

508
01:06:32,701 --> 01:06:35,022
You've never felt this way before?

509
01:06:36,741 --> 01:06:39,756
You just said it.
What's the first time?

510
01:06:40,522 --> 01:06:42,061
Do I have to tell you?

511
01:06:42,086 --> 01:06:43,436
I want you to tell me.

512
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,069
I'm thinking of Hiroko.

513
01:06:47,366 --> 01:06:48,475
I don't care.

514
01:06:51,381 --> 01:06:53,936
You and Hiroko are cousins.

515
01:06:55,233 --> 01:07:00,076
I don't want to compare them, but I do.

516
01:07:02,264 --> 01:07:03,459
That's enough.

517
01:07:04,178 --> 01:07:06,553
How did you tell Hiroko?

518
01:07:07,709 --> 01:07:11,912
I told her I was going home for a drink after the workshop because some of my college buddies were with me.

519
01:07:13,616 --> 01:07:16,420
I can't stay here. I'm frustrated.

520
01:07:17,709 --> 01:07:19,287
Don't miss the last ferry.

521
01:07:20,194 --> 01:07:23,061
I don't wanna go home.

522
01:07:42,718 --> 01:07:44,929
Mom.
I'm not a child.

523
01:07:45,453 --> 01:07:49,851
But your uncle asked me to come here.

524
01:08:08,341 --> 01:08:12,193
Today is Shota's 7th birthday.

525
01:08:12,218 --> 01:08:19,333
Let's celebrate and give thanks to God.

526
01:08:21,966 --> 01:08:23,599
Congratulations.

527
01:08:23,943 --> 01:08:25,052
Congratulations.

528
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:26,771
Congratulations.

529
01:08:26,796 --> 01:08:28,872
Let's get started.

530
01:08:32,146 --> 01:08:36,474
Come to think of it, Sho is the only one who doesn't have the Omi family bloodline.

531
01:08:37,240 --> 01:08:39,513
I feel sorry for you.

532
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:47,513
If Ukiko had three children, there would be no problem.

533
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:48,771
Uncle.

534
01:08:50,021 --> 01:08:54,685
I'm talking about after you get married.

535
01:08:55,068 --> 01:08:58,052
Just in case,right?

536
01:08:58,693 --> 01:09:03,083
He is looking for you to marry into the family.

537
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:04,818
Seriously.

538
01:09:09,185 --> 01:09:12,185
That's good.

539
01:09:12,794 --> 01:09:15,169
Uncle, is that really true?

540
01:09:15,833 --> 01:09:17,771
You don't like it?

541
01:09:18,443 --> 01:09:22,552
I've been very reluctant to do so for the past year or two.

542
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:36,629
You.

543
01:09:42,145 --> 01:09:44,496
Mom, you're wearing a ring today.

544
01:09:45,043 --> 01:09:46,879
It's a wedding ring.

545
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:54,379
It's Shota's birthday.
Your father and mother got married and Shota was born.

546
01:09:54,965 --> 01:09:56,348
So I'm wearing it.

547
01:10:00,004 --> 01:10:01,473
I'll drink a lot tonight.

548
01:10:02,762 --> 01:10:04,934
You are already drunk.

549
01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:16,965
What's wrong?

550
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:19,746
It's about your remarriage.

551
01:10:20,262 --> 01:10:23,660
That noisy father said he'd take care of you.

552
01:10:23,902 --> 01:10:27,215
A woman like me can't just get married.

553
01:10:27,645 --> 01:10:33,660
You were and still are a good woman
Too good to be true.

554
01:10:36,824 --> 01:10:38,488
I'll help you clean up.

555
01:10:39,746 --> 01:10:42,925
Serve tea for Atsumi and mom.

556
01:10:45,457 --> 01:10:47,559
This tea ok?

557
01:10:48,059 --> 01:10:50,137
Serve caffeine-free hot tea for Atsumi.

558
01:10:50,715 --> 01:10:54,504
He can't sleep at night when he drinks tea.

559
01:10:56,051 --> 01:11:00,270
When a man can't sleep, he wants to have sex.

560
01:11:03,445 --> 01:11:08,031
Sleeping pills weren't enough for him.
My body is made to have sleeping pills.

561
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:12,124
You know what I mean.

562
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:28,240
Take care.

563
01:11:28,725 --> 01:11:31,069
You're drunk.

564
01:11:42,805 --> 01:11:46,009
Is it true you drink strong tea and can't sleep at night?

565
01:11:46,712 --> 01:11:47,501
what are you talking about?

566
01:11:47,907 --> 01:11:51,079
If you can't sleep, don't have sex with Hiroko.

567
01:11:52,321 --> 01:11:53,524
She said that?

568
01:11:53,907 --> 01:11:56,704
What's wrong?

569
01:11:57,024 --> 01:11:59,227
Don't have sex with Hiroko tonight.

570
01:11:59,641 --> 01:12:00,837
Good night.

571
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:17,922
Did you talk to UKI-chan today?

572
01:12:18,461 --> 01:12:20,696
Not really.

573
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:41,665
You were so excited after seeing her before.

574
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:44,882
I get it.

575
01:13:53,699 --> 01:13:54,645
What are you doing?

576
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:06,339
I'm trying this because I think this abalone will still be alive if I remove it from its shell.

577
01:14:08,924 --> 01:14:10,463
It's impossible.

578
01:14:13,439 --> 01:14:18,494
I don't think the shells have anything to do with this life.

579
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:23,033
I think I can do that if I take it slow.

580
01:14:53,352 --> 01:14:54,399
see what's happened.

581
01:14:58,665 --> 01:14:59,188
Oh.

582
01:15:00,962 --> 01:15:02,305
I get it.

583
01:15:03,673 --> 01:15:07,813
The only reason he died was because of the pain he was stripped of.

584
01:15:08,892 --> 01:15:13,165
The slow, slow, slow way the pain multiplied.

585
01:15:14,312 --> 01:15:18,606
If I strip him down all at once, maybe he'll live longer than I thought.

586
01:15:19,436 --> 01:15:20,015
Look.

587
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,667
If you strip him down all at once, maybe he'll live longer?

588
01:15:23,381 --> 01:15:24,601
She said like that.

589
01:15:25,820 --> 01:15:27,980
Then she'd start over with another abalone.

590
01:15:28,005 --> 01:15:28,595
Stop it.

591
01:15:30,833 --> 01:15:31,513
I feel scary.

592
01:15:49,504 --> 01:15:51,111
Why are you telling me this?

593
01:15:53,539 --> 01:15:55,513
It's been on my mind.

594
01:16:01,469 --> 01:16:03,202
I'm leaving today.

595
01:16:05,590 --> 01:16:07,816
Drop me at Katsumoto.
I'll take the bus home.

596
01:16:25,566 --> 01:16:27,666
I'm glad you back home.

597
01:16:28,001 --> 01:16:29,881
What's going on the fish?

598
01:16:30,153 --> 01:16:35,093
We asked people to take out this fish.

599
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:36,432
Why?

600
01:16:37,373 --> 01:16:41,273
Hirono will visit us.

601
01:16:43,008 --> 01:16:44,315
Why is he coming?

602
01:16:50,034 --> 01:16:51,074
Where have you been?

603
01:16:51,905 --> 01:16:54,852
I've been waiting for you.

604
01:17:00,630 --> 01:17:05,977
Why is Hirono coming?

605
01:17:06,004 --> 01:17:07,344
I asked him to come here.

606
01:17:07,649 --> 01:17:09,062
Is that bad?

607
01:17:10,230 --> 01:17:12,183
I hate you.

608
01:17:12,208 --> 01:17:13,707
I don't care.

609
01:17:14,289 --> 01:17:16,935
No matter how you hate me, Hirono is coming.

610
01:17:17,059 --> 01:17:18,779
Then it's okay if I don't see him.

611
01:17:19,438 --> 01:17:20,892
What?

612
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:24,933
Hirono-kun said he wanted to see you.

613
01:17:28,122 --> 01:17:30,042
I think he miss you.

614
01:17:33,072 --> 01:17:34,359
He really said that?

615
01:17:37,484 --> 01:17:43,537
I think it means he wants to see you.

616
01:18:54,965 --> 01:18:58,519
I feel sorry about the fish.

617
01:19:03,946 --> 01:19:04,953
Uncle.

618
01:19:07,181 --> 01:19:09,048
Don't ask me.

619
01:19:10,558 --> 01:19:12,478
I'm busy.

620
01:19:13,445 --> 01:19:14,898
I'll meet him.

621
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,813
I'll see him... pleasantly.

622
01:19:44,427 --> 01:19:48,494
Hi, sorry if I bother you.

623
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:52,903
How long will you stay?

624
01:19:53,251 --> 01:19:55,178
I only have 3 hours.

625
01:19:55,726 --> 01:19:58,753
You'll have only 2 hours.
You have to drive to airport.

626
01:20:00,563 --> 01:20:01,570
You look fine.

627
01:20:03,414 --> 01:20:05,540
Are you going on a business trip to Hakata?

628
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:10,542
So Shiomi from the secretarial section over here told me about you yesterday.

629
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:13,199
Sorry if I bother you.

630
01:20:15,099 --> 01:20:17,326
I thought you'd been forgotten.

631
01:20:23,261 --> 01:20:24,408
He's here.

632
01:20:25,508 --> 01:20:28,915
Come in.

633
01:20:33,071 --> 01:20:34,124
Uncle.

634
01:20:34,418 --> 01:20:37,631
You don't have time.
You don't need to greet me.

635
01:20:40,912 --> 01:20:42,052
Excuse me.

636
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:49,622
Where shall we start?
We had an appointment over the phone.

637
01:20:51,181 --> 01:20:53,601
It's an old story, so I'll tell you.

638
01:20:53,875 --> 01:20:54,875
Please.

639
01:20:55,594 --> 01:20:59,667
Ukiko is keeping her mouth shut.
And her mother is clueless.

640
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:03,888
Well, let me tell you in a nutshell.

641
01:21:07,222 --> 01:21:15,531
It was my direct subordinate who got into a strange relationship with Ukiko.

642
01:21:16,697 --> 01:21:20,024
That Echigo guy?

643
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,376
I let him come in and out of my house freely, and we have a meal together.

644
01:21:26,696 --> 01:21:33,096
He was the kind of guy who would sometimes do Ukiko's chores for her.

645
01:21:34,163 --> 01:21:35,590
With him..

646
01:21:35,703 --> 01:21:41,203
I understand that your dog bit you on the hand.

647
01:21:41,393 --> 01:21:42,413
You're right.

648
01:21:43,602 --> 01:21:48,569
As a company man, it's not a good position to be in if my subordinate cuckolded my wife.

649
01:21:49,949 --> 01:21:53,076
I understand about your position.

650
01:21:54,821 --> 01:22:03,315
In exchange, I'll give you my wife, but you have to quit your job.

651
01:22:04,261 --> 01:22:08,141
The man quit his job, went back to the country, and Ukiko and I got divorced.

652
01:22:08,862 --> 01:22:10,082
I’m sorry.

653
01:22:11,854 --> 01:22:13,541
I get it.

654
01:22:14,322 --> 01:22:16,369
And you know the rest.

655
01:22:17,886 --> 01:22:19,653
Get out.

656
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:28,962
The man didn't have the guts to take Ukiko on.
He was involved in that incident in Yuzawa.

657
01:22:29,892 --> 01:22:31,932
I get it.

658
01:22:33,972 --> 01:22:36,579
Hiroko, it's been a while.

659
01:22:36,927 --> 01:22:39,500
Stay here.

660
01:22:40,770 --> 01:22:43,663
We can eat all of this fish.

661
01:22:44,065 --> 01:22:46,792
Enjoy this fish.

662
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:52,437
I kind of feel like I'm surrounded by all your relatives when I do this.

663
01:22:53,742 --> 01:22:57,715
Hirono will be living abroad by the end of this year

664
01:22:59,082 --> 01:23:03,229
He's looking for a wife.

665
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:05,830
Uncle.

666
01:23:06,258 --> 01:23:07,665
We don't have to talk about it.

667
01:23:08,107 --> 01:23:13,713
Please get Uki off this island.

668
01:23:15,054 --> 01:23:16,487
It's for Uki's own good.

669
01:23:18,474 --> 01:23:19,501
Please.

670
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:33,959
I have very mixed feelings about this.

671
01:23:34,866 --> 01:23:37,366
I'm in trouble.

672
01:23:58,894 --> 01:24:00,068
We've got a little time.

673
01:24:00,914 --> 01:24:05,494
Half an hour.
Would you like him to take you around to some of the more scenic spots?

674
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:11,180
I'd like to talk.
Can you pick a place for us to go?

675
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,165
Driver, go to Bamboo Street, please.

676
01:24:27,992 --> 01:24:29,352
Thank you so much for hanging out with me today.

677
01:24:29,645 --> 01:24:35,199
Thanks for coming.
My uncle force you to come here.

678
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:38,208
I'll be brief because we don't have time.

679
01:24:39,778 --> 01:24:44,552
He was right about me being stationed overseas and about wanting to get married.

680
01:24:45,684 --> 01:24:47,372
What do you think?

681
01:24:48,192 --> 01:24:52,341
It's so sudden.

682
01:24:54,911 --> 01:24:56,294
Just tell me what you feel.

683
01:24:58,481 --> 01:25:03,544
If you were to choose me, I'd say it's too good for me.

684
01:25:04,325 --> 01:25:07,349
I'll ask you straight out... are you seeing a guy right now?

685
01:25:10,875 --> 01:25:12,281
Why do you say that?

686
01:25:13,735 --> 01:25:21,274
Hiroko looked me straight in the eye and told me to get you off this island.

687
01:25:22,508 --> 01:25:24,110
I knew intuitively that something was up

688
01:25:26,141 --> 01:25:27,063
Tell me.

689
01:25:28,789 --> 01:25:32,633
I don't want to make a mistake, and neither do you

690
01:25:37,180 --> 01:25:38,344
I see a guy.

691
01:25:43,825 --> 01:25:44,427
I see.

692
01:25:46,443 --> 01:25:47,896
I'm sorry.

693
01:25:51,099 --> 01:25:56,685
Even if you have a boyfriend, you should say you don't.

694
01:25:59,224 --> 01:26:03,755
I can tell other people, but I don't want to lie to Toru-san.

695
01:26:04,255 --> 01:26:05,200
You are stupid.

696
01:26:07,028 --> 01:26:11,763
You embarrassed me with your honest confession about Imaizumi before.

697
01:26:13,325 --> 01:26:14,575
And now you'll do it again.

698
01:26:17,950 --> 01:26:20,911
It's hard for me, too.

699
01:26:24,216 --> 01:26:25,020
I can't believe it.

700
01:26:28,333 --> 01:26:29,184
I can't believe it.

701
01:26:31,944 --> 01:26:34,897
You might think you're a sinful woman.

702
01:26:36,101 --> 01:26:42,757
I hate these words after all.

703
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:52,624
Your body wants men.

704
01:27:29,330 --> 01:27:30,689
You're early.

705
01:27:31,728 --> 01:27:33,548
Didn't you take him to the airport?

706
01:27:34,494 --> 01:27:37,048
I thought you were going to follow him to Hakata.

707
01:27:40,134 --> 01:27:44,533
We talked, and then we left.

708
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:46,501
You left?

709
01:27:50,603 --> 01:27:52,845
Will you two never meet again?

710
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:56,416
No.

711
01:28:04,919 --> 01:28:11,325
What's the reason?
He liked you, but why did that happen?

712
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:13,172
What's the reason?

713
01:28:13,984 --> 01:28:14,765
I can't tell you.

714
01:28:15,476 --> 01:28:19,054
You broke up with him for some reason.

715
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:24,398
Did you selfishly refuse it?

716
01:28:24,914 --> 01:28:26,172
I think you might be right.

717
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:28,992
Let me go.

718
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:31,273
Do as you please

719
01:28:48,347 --> 01:28:50,301
You are stupid.
Why you didn't stop.

720
01:28:52,058 --> 01:28:53,097
Are you alright?

721
01:28:53,122 --> 01:28:54,832
I'm alright.

722
01:31:46,772 --> 01:31:49,749
Which hospital is it? Where is she?

723
01:31:50,077 --> 01:31:53,640
She's at Futsukaichi Central Hospital.
She's going to be okay.

724
01:31:53,897 --> 01:31:57,062
Dad says I should wait here until she calls.

725
01:31:57,632 --> 01:31:58,390
Where's Atsumi?

726
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,601
He took the first flight.

727
01:32:01,382 --> 01:32:04,358
What's the hell?

728
01:32:06,007 --> 01:32:07,601
I am Hiroko's father.

729
01:32:08,054 --> 01:32:10,577
Why didn't she call me?

730
01:32:11,194 --> 01:32:13,054
Calm down.

731
01:32:13,079 --> 01:32:14,905
I'm going.

732
01:32:16,476 --> 01:32:19,819
You stay with Ukiko here.

733
01:32:19,929 --> 01:32:21,194
I'm going too.

734
01:32:21,219 --> 01:32:22,382
Shut up!

735
01:32:26,818 --> 01:32:30,193
If you receive a phone call, respond promptly.

736
01:32:56,815 --> 01:32:57,956
Why?

737
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:02,683
Why?

738
01:33:09,758 --> 01:33:13,719
Why did you go to Futsukaichi station?

739
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:26,766
I was going to kuno-san's house in Takamiya, but I was dawdling and suddenly my foot slipped.

740
01:33:35,717 --> 01:33:36,670
What's wrong?

741
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,311
It was pulled by a rubber band or something and slowly settled down.

742
01:33:41,514 --> 01:33:42,881
What's the hell?

743
01:33:44,233 --> 01:33:46,061
I have no idea.

744
01:33:46,725 --> 01:33:49,194
Why did it happened?

745
01:33:49,219 --> 01:33:50,389
I have no idea.

746
01:33:52,969 --> 01:33:55,203
Where are you going?

747
01:33:56,133 --> 01:33:57,391
Hold on.

748
01:33:58,514 --> 01:34:05,076
No one really knows what happened.

749
01:34:06,437 --> 01:34:11,367
She had an accident and is feeling very bad for us.

750
01:34:11,392 --> 01:34:12,398
By any chance,Hiroko..

751
01:34:12,609 --> 01:34:14,211
She's not like you.

752
01:34:16,133 --> 01:34:23,266
Your divorce from Hirono was a huge shock to her.

753
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:32,320
She came out despite her bad leg.
Please understand her.

754
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:43,039
You'll be fine.

755
01:34:43,976 --> 01:34:47,883
Thank you for taking time off work to look after me.

756
01:34:48,922 --> 01:34:50,422
Stay strong.

757
01:34:51,945 --> 01:34:54,851
We all support you.

758
01:34:59,070 --> 01:35:00,586
I'll be back.

759
01:35:08,441 --> 01:35:09,222
Uki.

760
01:35:10,417 --> 01:35:11,081
Thank you very much.

761
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:15,886
I'm sorry you had to come all the way out here.

762
01:35:18,371 --> 01:35:20,847
You want some fruit?

763
01:35:21,136 --> 01:35:23,886
I don't need it now.
I'd rather talk.

764
01:35:25,445 --> 01:35:26,640
Have a seat.

765
01:35:27,788 --> 01:35:29,499
No, don't be quiet, okay?

766
01:35:30,507 --> 01:35:31,710
Do you remember?

767
01:35:33,124 --> 01:35:37,070
The summer of my sophomore year in high school, when Uki came to Iki by herself.

768
01:35:37,640 --> 01:35:38,773
I wonder what happened.

769
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:44,851
You got an appendectomy and were admitted to Akagi Hospital.

770
01:35:47,390 --> 01:35:49,890
Hiroko accompanied me.

771
01:35:50,741 --> 01:36:00,640
We chatted till midnight.
The young teacher got angry.

772
01:36:01,101 --> 01:36:02,507
I forgot.

773
01:36:03,765 --> 01:36:04,554
Yeah.

774
01:36:06,726 --> 01:36:09,585
I remember everything about Uki.

775
01:36:17,960 --> 01:36:19,570
Stay over tonight.

776
01:36:23,421 --> 01:36:24,663
Stay with me.

777
01:36:39,029 --> 01:36:42,138
Yuki-chan,still awake?

778
01:36:43,396 --> 01:36:46,427
Does it hurt?
If it hurts, I'll get you some medicine.

779
01:36:46,528 --> 01:36:50,856
Don't worry.
I like the darkness.

780
01:36:55,529 --> 01:36:57,451
I'll get you some medicine.

781
01:36:58,396 --> 01:36:59,060
Don't worry.

782
01:37:02,232 --> 01:37:08,896
It's more about Yuzawa.
Tell me about Echigo-Yuzawa.

783
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:13,271
Why now?

784
01:37:14,349 --> 01:37:16,084
Tell me about Echigo-Yuzawa.

785
01:37:16,349 --> 01:37:19,052
Let's not do that.
We'll only make us feel worse.

786
01:37:19,077 --> 01:37:19,842
Don't worry.

787
01:37:21,240 --> 01:37:22,842
Tell me about Echigo-Yuzawa.

788
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:25,631
Oh my god.

789
01:37:34,076 --> 01:37:39,271
I wasn't that serious.
I didn't really think about dying.

790
01:37:40,318 --> 01:37:49,943
But I wanted him to respond to my feelings a little.
I was being frivolous.

791
01:37:55,709 --> 01:37:57,131
You were not.

792
01:38:02,295 --> 01:38:05,849
I feel sorry for you.

793
01:38:50,206 --> 01:38:51,496
Hiroko!

794
01:38:53,542 --> 01:38:56,300
Don't look at me.

795
01:39:06,036 --> 01:39:09,669
Nurse!
Call doctor!

796
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:16,567
Atsumi?
It's me.

797
01:39:17,622 --> 01:39:20,559
Hiroko just fell off the bed.

798
01:39:20,661 --> 01:39:21,411
What do you mean?

799
01:39:23,122 --> 01:39:26,309
She kind of rolled over like she did it on purpose.

800
01:39:29,051 --> 01:39:31,247
The doctor says it's nothing.

801
01:39:31,895 --> 01:39:33,833
I'll be right there.

802
01:39:34,442 --> 01:39:35,192
Come here soon.

803
01:39:36,403 --> 01:39:39,919
Don't come near her anymore.

804
01:39:40,887 --> 01:39:45,309
Leave her alone.
There's nothing more to do for Hiroko.

805
01:39:46,708 --> 01:39:47,372
Ok?

806
01:39:48,387 --> 01:39:48,864
Yes.

807
01:40:23,650 --> 01:40:24,556
Get the ferry?

808
01:40:24,837 --> 01:40:25,814
Later is fine.

809
01:40:29,212 --> 01:40:31,868
I heard you turned down Hirono-san.

810
01:40:33,681 --> 01:40:35,689
You don't have to worry about that.

811
01:40:38,134 --> 01:40:39,126
I know.

812
01:40:41,259 --> 01:40:44,736
My uncle hasn't spoken to me since then.

813
01:40:45,986 --> 01:40:49,954
Nobody is on my side anymore.

814
01:40:50,197 --> 01:40:52,697
Can you be patient with me for a little while longer?

815
01:40:54,150 --> 01:40:56,837
I have a lot of important things on my mind right now.

816
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:03,532
But I don't want to cause Hiroko any more pain.

817
01:41:04,056 --> 01:41:07,868
There's also Shota.
Can't you wait a little longer?

818
01:41:14,429 --> 01:41:15,382
I have to go.

819
01:41:17,898 --> 01:41:20,718
I can't run away.

820
01:41:40,316 --> 01:41:41,581
Are you going out?

821
01:41:44,042 --> 01:41:45,605
Of course.

822
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:04,097
You dragged Hiroko off the bed.

823
01:42:05,401 --> 01:42:06,292
Mother.

824
01:42:07,284 --> 01:42:12,690
That's why Hiroko has to stay in the hospital for two more weeks.

825
01:42:16,034 --> 01:42:20,549
Your uncle talks bad about you.

826
01:42:23,448 --> 01:42:28,940
I should've left you at Echigo-Yuzawa.

827
01:42:45,847 --> 01:42:52,416
This is a truly slanderous letter.

828
01:42:53,104 --> 01:42:55,932
Thank you for letting me know.

829
01:42:57,167 --> 01:43:00,292
This is really bad.

830
01:43:00,807 --> 01:43:04,143
This is full of malice.

831
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:07,838
You don't need to worry about this letter.

832
01:43:09,096 --> 01:43:11,276
But you always get this kind of letters.

833
01:43:11,377 --> 01:43:15,198
I couldn't just ignore it, could I?

834
01:43:21,233 --> 01:43:22,929
I'm so embarrassed.

835
01:43:35,582 --> 01:43:36,856
What can I do for you?

836
01:43:38,348 --> 01:43:40,434
Nothing.

837
01:43:42,278 --> 01:43:46,286
You can leave now.

838
01:43:47,215 --> 01:43:51,153
Don't worry.
I have permission from the school.

839
01:43:53,129 --> 01:43:56,661
Shota... I've been asked to keep him at uncle's house.

840
01:43:58,887 --> 01:44:01,262
It's easier for me too.

841
01:44:02,856 --> 01:44:05,348
I don't want you to worry about me.

842
01:44:06,715 --> 01:44:08,590
I'm sure everything will be fine now.

843
01:44:11,536 --> 01:44:13,793
I feel sorry.

844
01:44:16,043 --> 01:44:17,473
You feel sorry?

845
01:44:19,309 --> 01:44:20,614
I don't want you to say that.

846
01:44:28,293 --> 01:44:29,160
Hiroko?

847
01:44:29,645 --> 01:44:34,715
If you're going to talk like that.
I don't want you here.

848
01:44:36,950 --> 01:44:39,114
I don't want you here.

849
01:44:42,762 --> 01:44:44,418
I don't want you to stay.

850
01:45:04,498 --> 01:45:05,287
Come in.

851
01:45:08,849 --> 01:45:11,006
I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

852
01:45:12,795 --> 01:45:14,334
Have a seat.

853
01:45:16,607 --> 01:45:19,779
I have something to talk to you about.

854
01:45:22,099 --> 01:45:23,779
How's your wife?

855
01:45:24,537 --> 01:45:27,318
Her shoulder's better now.
The cast is still in place.

856
01:45:28,701 --> 01:45:32,576
She just twisted her neck a little bit, so she's got tingling in her arms and legs.

857
01:45:33,467 --> 01:45:35,490
How about her face?

858
01:45:35,615 --> 01:45:38,412
She got a little cut above her eye, but she'll be fine.

859
01:45:39,076 --> 01:45:40,076
Will it leave a scar?

860
01:45:40,412 --> 01:45:41,295
I think she'll be fine.

861
01:45:41,881 --> 01:45:44,592
I'm worried about your wife.

862
01:45:48,302 --> 01:45:51,717
By the way, did you just build a house over here?

863
01:45:53,326 --> 01:45:53,724
Yes.

864
01:45:54,138 --> 01:45:56,904
Then I guess it's hard for you to transfer.

865
01:45:57,521 --> 01:45:58,521
Is that what you're telling me now?

866
01:45:59,138 --> 01:46:00,795
Don't be so hard on yourself.

867
01:46:01,295 --> 01:46:03,185
I've talked it over with Take.

868
01:46:03,210 --> 01:46:04,240
My father?

869
01:46:07,154 --> 01:46:09,842
I got this letter.

870
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:12,544
This.

871
01:46:13,709 --> 01:46:16,256
It's a small island here.

872
01:46:17,240 --> 01:46:20,342
There's nothing more interesting than rumors about a man and a woman.
You want to read it?

873
01:46:23,383 --> 01:46:24,781
No thanks.

874
01:46:25,422 --> 01:46:30,836
Your wife and Take's niece had an argument in Sakyobana.

875
01:46:31,437 --> 01:46:34,937
I heard your wife was almost pushed off a cliff.

876
01:46:36,391 --> 01:46:41,250
I don't think that's true.
Do you think this letter speaks for your wife?

877
01:47:30,370 --> 01:47:32,245
I'm off.

878
01:48:07,532 --> 01:48:09,212
Thank you for the food.

879
01:48:16,720 --> 01:48:17,775
Sit there.

880
01:48:25,704 --> 01:48:27,743
Hiroko will be released from the hospital soon.

881
01:48:29,282 --> 01:48:34,743
I'm going to take care of her and Shota.

882
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:44,041
Even with you here, I think this is a big house.

883
01:48:45,595 --> 01:48:49,033
But I think it would be difficult for you and her to live together.

884
01:48:51,220 --> 01:48:54,306
Hiroko is suffering and so are you.

885
01:48:59,408 --> 01:49:00,595
I don't tell the reason

886
01:49:02,330 --> 01:49:05,705
I think you understand that very well.

887
01:49:06,931 --> 01:49:09,963
Please apologize to him.

888
01:49:11,150 --> 01:49:13,611
You brought this all on yourself.

889
01:49:13,636 --> 01:49:14,728
Shut up!

890
01:49:17,402 --> 01:49:20,160
I'm not emotional.

891
01:49:23,074 --> 01:49:25,293
It's up to you.

892
01:49:26,863 --> 01:49:30,012
Think about it, please.

893
01:49:33,504 --> 01:49:35,910
I'm leaving today.

894
01:49:37,332 --> 01:49:40,918
No, I don't mean today or tomorrow.

895
01:49:42,067 --> 01:49:44,918
Think about it, please.

896
01:49:46,684 --> 01:49:48,699
But I'm leaving today.

897
01:49:49,793 --> 01:49:51,770
You can have her back anytime.

898
01:49:54,629 --> 01:49:57,465
I don't have anywhere to go, but I'll be fine.

899
01:49:59,011 --> 01:50:03,191
But my mother doesn't mind if she stay here, does she?

900
01:50:03,527 --> 01:50:05,160
That's a given.

901
01:50:05,910 --> 01:50:08,660
You don't need to worry about her.

902
01:50:09,848 --> 01:50:12,199
It's not worth it for you to say that.

903
01:50:16,881 --> 01:50:19,849
If I fail, I'll come back somehow.

904
01:50:21,295 --> 01:50:34,896
But your heart is so polluted that I don't think you'll ever be able to recover.

905
01:51:01,418 --> 01:51:04,191
Are you really leaving out today?

906
01:51:05,535 --> 01:51:06,855
Because we made a promise.

907
01:51:08,683 --> 01:51:10,777
It's starting to rain.

908
01:51:11,121 --> 01:51:12,418
Are you alright?

909
01:51:12,443 --> 01:51:13,683
I'm alright.

910
01:51:15,191 --> 01:51:18,738
I'm not alright.

911
01:51:22,418 --> 01:51:24,473
I feel pain.

912
01:51:26,504 --> 01:51:33,918
I want you to be happy more than anyone else.

913
01:52:45,364 --> 01:52:48,794
She is not good at greeting.

914
01:52:51,067 --> 01:52:57,302
I will greet you on her behalf.
Thank you for all your help.

915
01:53:00,192 --> 01:53:01,130
Tomoe.

916
01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:11,809
Do you want to go with her?

917
01:53:14,323 --> 01:53:15,590
Tell me.

918
01:53:21,275 --> 01:53:25,213
To be honest, it's 50-50.

919
01:53:27,018 --> 01:53:32,736
If Hiroko comes back, I won't be needed in this house.

920
01:53:34,291 --> 01:53:35,064
So.

921
01:53:35,893 --> 01:53:37,228
Stop it....

922
01:53:38,807 --> 01:53:44,486
And if you go with them, you will perish, too.

923
01:53:47,705 --> 01:53:51,525
Only she can go to hell.

924
01:53:53,166 --> 01:53:53,963
Bros.

925
01:54:00,045 --> 01:54:06,170
My heart is gone too.

926
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:18,654
People who are related to me thought I could change.

927
01:54:20,431 --> 01:54:22,962
But I couldn't do that.

928
01:54:27,454 --> 01:54:35,407
I am a really terrible teacher.

929
01:54:37,381 --> 01:54:39,413
I feel bad.

930
01:55:36,092 --> 01:55:36,874
What's wrong?

931
01:55:37,061 --> 01:55:39,647
I'm sorry.
I left the house.

932
01:55:39,836 --> 01:55:40,923
Come in.

933
01:55:42,426 --> 01:55:45,246
I just brought some personal stuff with me for now.

934
01:55:46,028 --> 01:55:46,895
You have nothing.

935
01:55:47,439 --> 01:55:48,845
I left it at the inn.

936
01:55:49,266 --> 01:55:49,746
Inn?

937
01:55:56,970 --> 01:55:58,544
I'm evil.

938
01:56:00,004 --> 01:56:01,557
For you and Hiroko.

939
01:56:02,274 --> 01:56:04,401
I mess up with your life.

940
01:56:13,753 --> 01:56:14,573
So what?

941
01:56:18,341 --> 01:56:21,335
I knew this would happen.

942
01:56:36,459 --> 01:56:38,392
Hiroko called the school.

943
01:56:39,894 --> 01:56:43,087
She said she wouldn't be back here for a while after she got out of the hospital.

944
01:56:53,946 --> 01:56:56,146
It's time for me to do something.

945
01:56:56,589 --> 01:56:58,129
Something I could do.

946
01:57:02,457 --> 01:57:12,079
I need to make a decision about Hiroko, about Shota, and about my teaching career here.

947
01:57:13,185 --> 01:57:14,198
Are you quitting?

948
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:18,713
I don't know if I can transfer when I move next.

949
01:57:19,898 --> 01:57:23,625
If I go to Hakata, I think I'll do some cramming.

950
01:57:24,459 --> 01:57:27,106
But I need time.

951
01:57:28,171 --> 01:57:31,871
You can live alone in Hakata until then.

952
01:57:34,852 --> 01:57:39,352
I'm going to get kicked out of here one way or another.

953
01:57:41,957 --> 01:57:44,371
You doubt me?

954
01:59:34,323 --> 01:59:37,523
I let my guard down.

955
01:59:38,569 --> 01:59:39,942
What do you mean?

956
01:59:42,232 --> 01:59:48,865
I thought I'd made it this far, that I could meditate the rest of the way and still make it to the end of my life.

957
01:59:51,352 --> 01:59:54,705
I thought I'd hit something this hard.

958
01:59:56,068 --> 01:59:59,175
Atsumi,Please turn back.

959
02:00:01,471 --> 02:00:05,898
I know how far I can go on my own.

960
02:00:06,148 --> 02:00:07,455
What are you talking about?

961
02:00:08,178 --> 02:00:11,071
Why don't you just leave me alone and do that?

962
02:00:14,239 --> 02:00:16,059
You can go back to being you.

963
02:00:21,222 --> 02:00:26,197
To tell you the truth, I'm still scared.

964
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:30,594
I'm up to you...

965
02:03:14,341 --> 02:03:14,761
Hi.

966
02:03:15,081 --> 02:03:17,901
Can you take me to Byobu...Well..Sakyobana.

967
02:03:18,630 --> 02:03:19,536
Now?

968
02:03:19,893 --> 02:03:22,013
I'm sorry.
I want to see the sunrise.

969
02:03:22,155 --> 02:03:23,735
That's the farthest east.

970
02:03:23,842 --> 02:03:24,548
No problem.

971
02:04:08,498 --> 02:04:11,518
Watch your step.
There's a precipice below.

972
02:04:11,705 --> 02:04:12,499
I know.

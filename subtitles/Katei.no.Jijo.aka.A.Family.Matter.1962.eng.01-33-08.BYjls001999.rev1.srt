<i>Katei no Jijo / A Family Matter (1962)</i>

3
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,318
I wish I had 500,000 yen

4
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:29,723
I have 50,000 yen in my bank account.

5
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:36,014
50,000 yen... that's 1/10.

6
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:37,598
Do you have it?

7
00:01:37,976 --> 00:01:38,456
No.

8
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,264
Not at all?

9
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:41,708
Just little bit, 10,000 yen? But if this is the case,

10
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,105
Just 10000yen?

11
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:46,434
we might not be able to get married for a while

12
00:01:46,459 --> 00:01:47,856
For the time being?

13
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,761
Maybe a year from now?

14
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,337
It may be two years

15
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,161
or maybe never

16
00:01:54,186 --> 00:01:55,474
I don't like that.

17
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:58,603
I've been saying that for a while.

18
00:01:59,266 --> 00:02:02,945
My older brother who paid for my college education like a parent

19
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:04,792
Now he's  trying to issue a dishonored bill.

20
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:05,862
Is the problem different?

21
00:02:05,886 --> 00:02:07,031
It's the same

22
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:09,636
My brother's family is in such a difficult situation

23
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:12,060
I'm not going to get married with a cool face

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,051
Can I say that?

25
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,327
Please use my 50000yen for him.

26
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,345
Thank you.

27
00:02:18,685 --> 00:02:20,545
But He needs 500,000 yen

28
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,857
It'll help a little, right?

29
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:23,750
It's like a drop in the bucket .

30
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,860
And I don't want to cause you any trouble

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,686
Don't worry.

32
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:33,760
Ah, I've come to your neighborhood. Let's say goodbye

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,846
I'll bring it to you tomorrow

34
00:02:36,362 --> 00:02:37,562
I feel sorry.

35
00:02:38,227 --> 00:02:40,236
You don't like me?

36
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,983
No way.

37
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:41,829
Really?

38
00:02:41,854 --> 00:02:42,370
Really.

39
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,843
Fumi is late.

40
00:03:10,957 --> 00:03:15,025
Oh, maybe she is working overtime?

41
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,830
or maybe she is at bar with a guy now.

42
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,537
You shouldn't talk it carelessly.

43
00:03:18,561 --> 00:03:19,880
It's not lie.

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,130
I saw the scene properly.

45
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,614
What's he like?

46
00:03:21,638 --> 00:03:24,000
Well, I guess I could say he's handsome

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,260
But he's not really to my taste

48
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,193
What's he like?

49
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:29,304
What should I say?

50
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:30,840
You know,like Ginnan.

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,350
Ginshio?

52
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,817
No...

53
00:03:32,842 --> 00:03:33,478
Gin-nagashi?

54
00:03:33,515 --> 00:03:34,533
Yes,that's it.

55
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:35,127
What's that?

56
00:03:35,227 --> 00:03:37,280
You know the old words.

57
00:03:38,132 --> 00:03:41,868
It was nice bath.
I washed all my body.

58
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,350
Oh...

59
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,170
I was charged 500 yen.

60
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:51,645
This wine is the finest from France,

61
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,070
so I'll have to split the cost

62
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,752
Yes..

63
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,510
You don't have to pay.

64
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,658
You are a customer.

65
00:04:01,467 --> 00:04:04,074
Welcome back, Fumiko.

66
00:04:04,186 --> 00:04:05,154
She's late.

67
00:04:06,626 --> 00:04:07,648
I'm home.

68
00:04:07,673 --> 00:04:08,482
What were you doing

69
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:09,713
You're fined

70
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,439
I’m sorry.

71
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:33,714
Happy birthday to you

72
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:37,757
Happy birthday to you

73
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:45,665
Happy birthday to you

74
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:49,180
Blow out the candles.

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,373
One breath.

76
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,296
Dad? Are you alright?

77
00:05:03,523 --> 00:05:04,297
I'm alright.

78
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:07,675
Turn it on.

79
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:09,175
let's have a toast.

80
00:05:12,956 --> 00:05:16,470
Thank you for all your hard work, Dad

81
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:17,384
Thanks.

82
00:05:20,647 --> 00:05:22,066
This is delicious.

83
00:05:22,509 --> 00:05:24,323
Let's eat

84
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,275
It's ironic that the day of my retirement is my birthday.

85
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,270
But they all became good girls

86
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:39,640
Seven years ago I was at a loss as to what to do when your mother died,

87
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,794
But they all grew really well

88
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:54,379
I have retired, but luckily my next job has been decided

89
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,858
I'll work at a real estate company.

90
00:05:57,255 --> 00:06:00,936
He says the monthly salary is 30,000 yen, so it's not bad.

91
00:06:01,055 --> 00:06:02,915
That's fine

92
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:06,285
By the way, I received 1.5 million yen after tax as a severance pay.

93
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:08,183
Oh, 1.5 million yen!

94
00:06:08,255 --> 00:06:11,159
Of this,I have 1 million yen in deposits, for a total of 2.5 million yen

95
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:13,442
Oh yeah.

96
00:06:19,258 --> 00:06:20,024
Yes, this is it

97
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,768
Hey everyone, come here.

98
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:37,726
Wow, there aren't many 1 million yen.

99
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:40,380
What are you talking about? It's 98 times your salary

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,609
You do a lot of calculations.

101
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:42,411
I work at accounting department.

102
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:45,065
You're probably about 90 times

103
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,443
The problem is how to use the 2.5 million yen

104
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:52,002
The easiest thing to do is to deposit it in a bank or put it in a loan trust

105
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,674
I think that's a good idea, but I have another idea

106
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:59,620
The 2.5 million yen will be divided equally among the five people, including me.

107
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:01,037
with 500,000 yen each.

108
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,896
I agree.

109
00:07:02,921 --> 00:07:03,537
I'm against it.

110
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:04,942
Oh, why

111
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,632
This the money our dad got.

112
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:10,703
What belongs to the father belongs to the daughter, right?

113
00:07:11,174 --> 00:07:12,141
I don't think so.

114
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:14,889
What do you think, sister?

115
00:07:15,766 --> 00:07:16,743
…Well,

116
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,627
wait a minute

117
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:24,690
The reason I thought of this is that this 2.5 million
yen will end up being used to help everyone get married

118
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:27,171
So I fear it will be unfair.

119
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,070
If We spend too much on the first thing, We won't have enough for the next thing

120
00:07:31,095 --> 00:07:32,327
I hate the idea.

121
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,470
Me either.

122
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,635
I am the youngest so I will definitely have disadvantage.

123
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,305
So we're all going to share it

124
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,280
Kazuyo, give everyone 500,000 yen

125
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:40,866
But...

126
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,836
it's okay

127
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:45,580
everyone is already grown up

128
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:48,252
You can take responsibility for yourself, right?

129
00:07:50,153 --> 00:07:51,173
I'm not needed.

130
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:55,120
Miyako, don't say that

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,300
You're the only one in the house who don't work.

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,150
You have to leave this house someday and get married

133
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,560
If you don't treat me equally, I will be in trouble

134
00:08:03,429 --> 00:08:05,522
OK I will take it.

135
00:08:08,021 --> 00:08:10,560
Well, how you use this money is up to you,

136
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,343
but I want to make sure that I've just given you all your marriage money

137
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,866
Therefore, I would like to be released from my
financial obligations as a father as of today

138
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,717
Are you relieved of the pressure?

139
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,097
However, I'm happy to give advice on mental health.

140
00:08:27,122 --> 00:08:28,798
of course, you are our father after all.

141
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,290
Future living expenses...

142
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,809
As before, you will have to pay 20% of your monthly salary. I will pay 10,000 yen

143
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,440
That should be ok.

144
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,262
Your income has decreased, so it's okay if it's less

145
00:08:40,287 --> 00:08:40,524
Yes,

146
00:08:40,548 --> 00:08:43,462
I'll give it because I don't have to save money for everyone anymore

147
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,456
By the way, one last thing.

148
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:56,471
I also want a little freedom

149
00:08:56,589 --> 00:08:58,363
What's the hell?

150
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:18,611
Are you gonna for walking?

151
00:09:21,285 --> 00:09:23,699
I woke up at 6:30 like usual.

152
00:09:30,447 --> 00:09:34,380
Well...Miwako, listen to the dream I had on the night I retired

153
00:09:35,335 --> 00:09:38,243
This is a dream from 30 years ago when I was a new employee

154
00:09:38,543 --> 00:09:43,641
I made a mistake with calculation and the boss really scold me.

155
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:47,790
You couldn't forget it because you were bad about Math.

156
00:09:48,415 --> 00:09:52,175
Plus, the chief passed away 10 years ago

157
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,602
Even though I thought I had forgotten, I couldn't forget

158
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,319
Is that so?

159
00:10:04,072 --> 00:10:04,561
Welcome.

160
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:05,586
Good morning

161
00:10:07,501 --> 00:10:08,511
Is your father there?

162
00:10:09,173 --> 00:10:09,973
Yes.

163
00:10:10,845 --> 00:10:13,595
Yoshie-san's aunt is here.

164
00:10:13,675 --> 00:10:15,348
Good morning.

165
00:10:16,714 --> 00:10:22,400
Well, it's pretty clean and the flowers are in good shape

166
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,270
I'm sure Miyako-san, 'll make a great wife

167
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,710
Oh, are you eating now? Excuse me

168
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,909
From today , I am in
a comfortable position.

169
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:32,253
That's right

170
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,900
My husband is jealous of you.

171
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,180
But now that time has come,

172
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,830
it feels like my life's work is over

173
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,246
and I miss my work.

174
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,125
Retirement means basically a declaration that
from today on you are an old man.

175
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:54,938
Don't say that, your new second life is just beginning

176
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:59,100
Actually, yes, I'm talking about a matchmaking.

177
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,830
As you know, I have four girls,

178
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,010
but they are all single.

179
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,320
If you have any good men..

180
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,930
Please introduce us in a raw.

181
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:12,379
You are all really lovely ladies.

182
00:11:12,984 --> 00:11:14,910
They are picky.

183
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,820
I was raising a child on my own.

184
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,208
it must have been difficult

185
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:24,096
By the way, about the marriage proposal?

186
00:11:25,816 --> 00:11:29,352
There is a nice woman for you.

187
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,993
For me?

188
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,642
Is it okay to take this?

189
00:11:41,273 --> 00:11:41,993
I feel sorry.

190
00:11:42,144 --> 00:11:42,770
Never mind.

191
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,032
It's natural for me to devote myself to you,

192
00:11:45,057 --> 00:11:47,360
 I really appreciate your feelings.

193
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:48,614
so please use them

194
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:55,709
Really? Sorry. I'm heading home now

195
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,232
You can check out what's inside

196
00:11:58,264 --> 00:12:02,394
I don't need to look it up.
I'm sure there is 50000yen.

197
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,221
But just to be safe

198
00:12:13,486 --> 00:12:14,546
500000yen.

199
00:12:17,296 --> 00:12:19,720
What on earth is this?

200
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,531
I really want you to use it

201
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:31,947
...Oh, I'm going to call my brother

202
00:12:31,972 --> 00:12:33,500
I have to make him happy

203
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,677
Excuse me

204
00:12:48,359 --> 00:12:49,339
Are you alone?

205
00:12:49,363 --> 00:12:50,035
No.

206
00:12:50,257 --> 00:12:51,510
With a guy.

207
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:02,586
Excuse me.

208
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,552
Welcome.

209
00:13:33,435 --> 00:13:34,795
Oh you are here.

210
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,940
Welcome.

211
00:13:39,311 --> 00:13:40,684
There's no table.

212
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,283
Come on,please wait.

213
00:13:43,812 --> 00:13:45,685
Go there.

214
00:13:46,288 --> 00:13:47,981
Thanks.

215
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:57,130
Excuse me

216
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,482
I'll clean it up right away.

217
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,915
You came after all.

218
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:06,090
You retired yesterday, didn't you?

219
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,325
I thought you wouldn't come again

220
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,319
I was worry about you.

221
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:12,550
I'm glad.

222
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,893
Hey, do you want to eat somewhere with me tonight?

223
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,535
I was thinking of eating here.

224
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,935
It's boring here.

225
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,883
Thanks

226
00:14:27,363 --> 00:14:28,563
Thanks

227
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:35,390
Let's go somewhere together

228
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:36,069
We+ll be alone?

229
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:37,002
You hate it?

230
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,416
I don't mind if we're alone,

231
00:14:40,261 --> 00:14:44,165
please just have one of my feelings

232
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,010
I will tell the boss that my brother was sick,

233
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:53,114
Let's decide the time to meet.

234
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:15,740
Excuse me

235
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:16,953
Yes

236
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,240
your companion will be arriving shortly.

237
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,160
but would you like to take a bath?

238
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,473
Ok.. Yes.

239
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,371
that's right. Let's take a bath

240
00:15:44,978 --> 00:15:46,399
The bath is here

241
00:15:47,493 --> 00:15:49,327
Then, here is the toilet

242
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,189
Hi.

243
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:09,812
Sorry I'm late.

244
00:16:12,463 --> 00:16:14,248
I want to join in too

245
00:16:15,351 --> 00:16:17,924
You can't.
I'm embarrassed.

246
00:16:18,492 --> 00:16:19,959
Don't be shy.

247
00:16:22,045 --> 00:16:22,805
I wanna have a bath.

248
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,519
Hey, come on.

249
00:16:24,763 --> 00:16:25,868
give me a break.

250
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,052
Why?

251
00:16:28,898 --> 00:16:32,988
I've never taken a bath with died my ex wife either.

252
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:36,069
If I go in with a woman, it'll hurt my heart

253
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,065
Oh really? Too bad. Well, it's fine if I just want to wash your back.

254
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:47,580
Let me do it.
You're pure.

255
00:16:48,613 --> 00:16:49,694
I like you

256
00:16:49,719 --> 00:16:50,361
Thanks.

257
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:55,563
You love me?

258
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:57,298
Of course

259
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,345
How much?

260
00:16:59,425 --> 00:17:00,052
A lot.

261
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:02,718
Can you show me the evidence later?

262
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:04,580
Okay, I'll show you

263
00:17:05,085 --> 00:17:07,646
Then, say I'm a man.

264
00:17:07,752 --> 00:17:09,238
I'm a man.

265
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,006
That's great. I'm happy.

266
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,637
Have a beer.

267
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,602
what's wrong? Are you cold?

268
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:38,667
No.

269
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:41,665
Have a beer.

270
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:44,795
Thank you too

271
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,040
Please.

272
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,730
Thank you for your hard work

273
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,781
You know what?, when I get drunk,will you treat me?

274
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:59,085
I will.

275
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:01,702
I'm so happy.
Cheers.

276
00:18:07,543 --> 00:18:08,887
Instead,

277
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:13,053
When you get drunk, I'll treat you too.

278
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,440
I'm excited.

279
00:18:14,812 --> 00:18:15,785
Have a beer.

280
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:21,432
I'm a man.

281
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:29,780
If this happens, I'll never let you go

282
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:32,740
No matter who comes, I'll never let you go

283
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,818
When we're married and time has passed, this night will be a fond memory

284
00:18:37,755 --> 00:18:38,982
I'll be good wife.

285
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:39,956
I'm counting on you.

286
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,200
We can definitely get married?

287
00:18:44,854 --> 00:18:48,492
My brother won't allow us to break up even if I become hate you.

288
00:18:48,593 --> 00:18:49,553
I wanna see your brother.

289
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,246
Sure.

290
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,120
I want to get married as soon as possible

291
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:56,986
I want to do it as soon as possible too.

292
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:03,167
Let's make our memories.

293
00:19:10,702 --> 00:19:12,489
We're getting married.

294
00:19:17,884 --> 00:19:19,270
May I?

295
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,240
What's wrong?

296
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:04,400
Thank you.

297
00:20:09,535 --> 00:20:09,980
Do you know him?

298
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:11,165
No.

299
00:20:14,216 --> 00:20:15,219
Let's go.

300
00:20:17,066 --> 00:20:18,070
Hold on.

301
00:20:23,548 --> 00:20:24,675
Let's go home tonight.

302
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:26,203
Why.

303
00:20:26,717 --> 00:20:27,617
I have to go home.

304
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,294
Wait a moment

305
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,940
What just happened.

306
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:55,997
It's too late if it became bad reputation at the company,

307
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,813
so if you decide to quit, I'll find you a good company to work for

308
00:21:00,143 --> 00:21:00,950
You're selfish.

309
00:21:01,646 --> 00:21:04,507
That's for your sake and for mine too

310
00:21:05,655 --> 00:21:06,402
See you.

311
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,004
Hey.

312
00:21:21,701 --> 00:21:23,897
I hope you'll stay here for the night

313
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:27,153
I'm sorry.

314
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,225
Instead, I will put it into action as soon as possible about Atami.

315
00:21:30,512 --> 00:21:31,292
Promise me.

316
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,686
I'm a man too

317
00:21:33,068 --> 00:21:39,277
I'm so happy, You know what..

318
00:21:40,155 --> 00:21:44,135
I never dreamed you'd have such a reliable person

319
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,441
Not so much,

320
00:21:45,466 --> 00:21:46,586
You're play boy.

321
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:51,006
You've been seducing women until now.

322
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,810
No, that's not true.

323
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:53,839
Being widowed by my wife..

324
00:21:53,864 --> 00:21:57,176
I'll be your only woman from now.

325
00:21:58,465 --> 00:21:59,225
Yeah.

326
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,429
If you don't understand, I'll kill myself!

327
00:22:03,132 --> 00:22:04,402
Don't scare me

328
00:22:07,648 --> 00:22:08,441
Bros.

329
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,306
What's wrong?

330
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:18,015
The lady here's been asking me for a
while now if I should open a small restaurant

331
00:22:19,266 --> 00:22:22,106
That kind of money is difficult, isn't it?

332
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:23,176
Yeah.

333
00:22:24,169 --> 00:22:28,141
but if I had 1.5 million yen, I couldn't afford it

334
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,887
- Whew, that's about it

335
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,141
So, this lady said to me, why don't you borrow 1.5 million yen from you?

336
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:39,312
Me?

337
00:22:39,772 --> 00:22:42,186
But I told her that no matter how much it was,

338
00:22:42,211 --> 00:22:44,525
I couldn't be so bold as to ask for it

339
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,991
But I don't rely on anyone else.

340
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:52,186
Of course, since I'm borrowing it, I'll pay the interest

341
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:56,195
I wonder if 5 percent a month would be okay?
But it's 6 percent for a fixed deposit.

342
00:22:56,689 --> 00:22:59,661
I think if I had two years I could get the money back to you.

343
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,477
I'm confident that I won't cause any trouble to you.

344
00:23:07,472 --> 00:23:08,885
Say I'm a man.

345
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:13,765
Unfortunately, I don't have that much money.

346
00:23:14,443 --> 00:23:16,603
You have a retirement bonus of 1.5 million yen

347
00:23:16,725 --> 00:23:20,053
No, I gave them all to my daughters

348
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,050
Is that a lie?

349
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:21,950
it's true

350
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,990
- You can take it back under paternal rights

351
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,409
I can't do that.

352
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,230
Oh yeah.

353
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:34,308
that's the kind of person you are.

354
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:38,041
You don't seem to care about me at all.

355
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,697
I'm thinking about you

356
00:23:43,595 --> 00:23:44,335
Never mind.

357
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:52,480
Tama-chan.

358
00:23:58,399 --> 00:23:59,013
Hey.

359
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:34,217
Please excuse me

360
00:24:41,047 --> 00:24:44,228
Hey, what's up with Tamako? It's my friend.

361
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,625
Can I have the bill?

362
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:48,552
Bill?

363
00:24:49,583 --> 00:24:51,022
Please pay it

364
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:53,660
I'll pay it.

365
00:24:55,974 --> 00:24:56,680
I'll pay it.

366
00:24:57,843 --> 00:24:59,540
How much is it?

367
00:25:00,476 --> 00:25:02,104
23,000 yen

368
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,428
How much?

369
00:25:04,453 --> 00:25:06,008
It's 23,000 yen

370
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,566
Dad

371
00:25:19,264 --> 00:25:23,090
where have you been?
Isn't today your day off?

372
00:25:23,632 --> 00:25:29,603
I have some business to take care of in Shinjuku, for The bank and other places.

373
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,678
You're late.

374
00:25:32,915 --> 00:25:34,588
I had to work overtime.

375
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:38,041
You've been working a lot of overtime lately

376
00:25:38,066 --> 00:25:38,541
Yes.

377
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,796
Oh, it's Kazuyo there.

378
00:25:43,963 --> 00:25:44,830
Sis.

379
00:25:46,259 --> 00:25:47,373
We took same train.

380
00:25:47,484 --> 00:25:48,044
You're late.

381
00:25:49,228 --> 00:25:50,248
I had to work overtime.

382
00:25:50,687 --> 00:25:52,786
It's been a while since you worked overtime.

383
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:55,246
I'm busy these days.

384
00:25:57,479 --> 00:26:02,284
Recently, there is a strange woman around our dad?

385
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:04,489
I don't know where is she from

386
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:07,760
Dad immediately refused it.

387
00:26:07,998 --> 00:26:09,625
but there's no need to refuse

388
00:26:10,631 --> 00:26:12,620
It's nice to see flowers bloom on dead trees

389
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,114
Dead trees are terrible.

390
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,633
He was like "I want to be free".

391
00:26:17,846 --> 00:26:20,532
Dad want a wife?

392
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,443
He's back.

393
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:33,899
I'm back! -

394
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:35,706
Welcome back.

395
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,631
Oh, that's what I though.

396
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:46,497
It's mine.

397
00:26:47,002 --> 00:26:50,594
I found you there. you owe me.

398
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:54,427
You can buy some for yourself.
You have 500,000 yen

399
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,010
I want to eat ochazuke.

400
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,137
Yes, me too

401
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,460
This milk is expensive, so please don't use too much

402
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,264
You're stingy.

403
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:11,856
Wanna have meal.

404
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,109
I don't want.

405
00:27:18,983 --> 00:27:19,598
What's wrong?

406
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,966
Is it okay.

407
00:27:24,594 --> 00:27:25,961
I'm just a little tired

408
00:27:41,028 --> 00:27:41,881
Sis.

409
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:44,898
Our father received a marriage proposal

410
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:47,613
Oh really?

411
00:27:50,854 --> 00:27:51,687
That's good.

412
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,852
that's not good, isn't it? There were some nosy people out there

413
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:57,100
You guys have to get married before me.

414
00:27:57,125 --> 00:27:58,980
Where is she from?

415
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:00,907
Apparently  Mrs. Yoshii's accentance.

416
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,550
Apparently she's unmarried and has one son in the third grade of elementary school

417
00:28:04,714 --> 00:28:06,405
So she's taking the kid?

418
00:28:06,644 --> 00:28:08,633
No.
I'm not getting married.

419
00:28:08,658 --> 00:28:11,013
Because everyone else is going to get married anyway,

420
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:12,869
Then dad will be lonely.

421
00:28:13,666 --> 00:28:14,566
You'd better married her.

422
00:28:14,873 --> 00:28:18,806
I don't know about you but I won't get married soon

423
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,710
Well, that's fine

424
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,273
Anyway, what happened to the 500,000 yen?

425
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,407
How about you?

426
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,453
I deposited it in the bank today.

427
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,753
How about you?

428
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,358
I saved up some money too.

429
00:28:29,472 --> 00:28:30,572
How about you?

430
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:32,232
Same here.

431
00:28:33,285 --> 00:28:36,065
It's really Ochazuke

432
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,012
Thanks.

433
00:28:37,127 --> 00:28:38,915
What happened to Shina-chan?

434
00:28:39,162 --> 00:28:41,902
 I started a part-time job.
lending at high interest business.

435
00:28:42,525 --> 00:28:44,259
lending at high interest?

436
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:49,612
It's our habit to always become a poor before payday

437
00:28:49,997 --> 00:28:56,187
Sometimes it's hard to live. It's really helpful to have someone to borrow money easily.

438
00:28:56,218 --> 00:28:58,081
That's right, that's helping people.

439
00:28:58,275 --> 00:29:01,915
There is no irrecoverable debt. All we have to do is work hard at the accounting counter.

440
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:04,799
How about 1% a day?
365% per year.

441
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:08,469
OK.

442
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:13,270
But I wonder if the section chief will get angry

443
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,940
I won't get in trouble. Even the chief will come and borrow it

444
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:20,307
You have to boldly announces that you will open a money lending business to earn your wedding funds.

445
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:25,629
I think I'll give it a try

446
00:29:25,654 --> 00:29:28,284
gave me 3000 yen, 4000 yen, and 2000 yen

447
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:29,584
1000 yen fro me.

448
00:29:30,026 --> 00:29:32,781
I lent them a total of 10,000 yen

449
00:29:33,822 --> 00:29:35,835
That 10,000 yen is unavoidable,

450
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,089
but please stop doing that in the future

451
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:38,268
Why?

452
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,490
spending money like that make you a vulgar person.

453
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,240
What's the hell?

454
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,880
You know, it's not the same as investing in mutual funds or stocks

455
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,230
It's easy work.

456
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:51,990
You doesn't need to do such things to make money

457
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,556
Did not you distribute them with respect to us?

458
00:29:54,581 --> 00:29:57,392
it's better to listen to the advice as it is

459
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,570
I don't know.

460
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:03,065
I don't do it to make money,

461
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:05,440
I do it for human research

462
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:08,812
People reveal their true colors in front of money.

463
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,065
And then you write a paper?

464
00:30:11,273 --> 00:30:12,195
I won't write a paper,

465
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:15,435
but maybe I'll find a good husband.

466
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,685
That doesn't mean it's masculine

467
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,672
Whatever.

468
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:00,086
Hi.

469
00:31:00,841 --> 00:31:01,599
Good morning.

470
00:31:08,717 --> 00:31:10,150
Did you see her?

471
00:31:11,469 --> 00:31:12,076
OK.

472
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:13,963
She looks young.

473
00:31:15,095 --> 00:31:16,455
She's actually pretty good

474
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,825
She still have a lot of energy.

475
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:28,360
Good morning.

476
00:31:31,858 --> 00:31:33,276
Good morning.

477
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:39,373
Good morning.

478
00:31:39,453 --> 00:31:40,600
good morning

479
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,545
Is there anything I can help you with today?

480
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:46,280
Oh no.

481
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,023
 Good morning.

482
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:17,937
Good morning.

483
00:32:18,378 --> 00:32:19,152
Good morning.

484
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,649
Good morning.

485
00:32:21,793 --> 00:32:22,609
What is this?

486
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:25,065
I heard it's for preventing arteriosclerosis.

487
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,772
Is the working well?

488
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,118
I have no idea.

489
00:32:30,363 --> 00:32:31,767
Hey Mitsuzawa-san?

490
00:32:32,441 --> 00:32:34,254
how's your blood pressure?

491
00:32:36,202 --> 00:32:38,340
The upper number is nothing serious,

492
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:39,859
but the lower number is 98

493
00:32:40,063 --> 00:32:42,427
If the lower number is higher, it's dangerous.

494
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:43,934
I see.

495
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:46,899
Oh yeah.

496
00:32:51,435 --> 00:32:53,636
Hello, hello, Kyowa Shoji,

497
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,797
please wait a moment

498
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,203
Managing Director: Oh,
it's from Misawa-san.

499
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:07,019
Mitsuzawa? Ah, it's Mitsuzawa-san who has retired

500
00:33:09,013 --> 00:33:11,957
Hello, it's me. Mitsuzawa

501
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,390
I'm working here starting today

502
00:33:15,647 --> 00:33:18,395
I put on a ridiculous comedy this morning.

503
00:33:18,426 --> 00:33:22,274
Suddenly I realized I was standing in front of the elevator over there

504
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:25,190
Thirty years of habits are scary

505
00:33:25,215 --> 00:33:25,851
So?

506
00:33:27,164 --> 00:33:29,619
So, actually, I have something to talk to you about.
It's about my daughter

507
00:33:30,119 --> 00:33:31,790
Would you like to have lunch with me?

508
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:34,575
Yes, thank you

509
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:36,142
At 12:30

510
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,272
Thank you, I'll be waiting

511
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,373
This Endo is a friend of mine from long ago

512
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,250
I joined the company as a female employee, but he is an executive and I am retiring.

513
00:33:51,027 --> 00:33:54,790
I think that both the eldest and second daughters
will find suitable partners and get married

514
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:56,210
the youngest child's Shinako will be ok.

515
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,941
She's very mature.

516
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,020
But I have to do something about the third sister,Miyako.

517
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,885
She's a very modest girl who doesn't go to work and just runs the house all the time

518
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,954
I'll let Yoshiyuki planning to go to France

519
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,311
When?

520
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:12,797
In 4,5 days.

521
00:34:13,271 --> 00:34:15,587
So please forget about marriage with Miyako.

522
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:26,070
Apparently Yoshiyuki felt sorry for Miyako

523
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:28,190
and was thinking about marrying her

524
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,714
That would be a problem for me

525
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:33,050
Being friends is being friends

526
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,541
I want to think of my relationships beside friendship as something different.

527
00:35:02,487 --> 00:35:03,178
what?

528
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,402
Take a look at it.

529
00:35:10,345 --> 00:35:12,120
I would like to resign this company.

530
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:12,977
Are you quitting?

531
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:13,424
Yes.

532
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:16,032
Why?

533
00:35:18,042 --> 00:35:20,740
You want me to quit, don't you?

534
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:26,357
Hold on.

535
00:35:36,072 --> 00:35:37,283
Hey, do you have
other plans?

536
00:35:37,313 --> 00:35:37,709
No,

537
00:35:41,585 --> 00:35:43,620
I'll be responsible for you
for the rest of my life

538
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,935
so please marry me

539
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:46,233
I have a wife.

540
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:51,399
I too am scared of this kind of life and I can't stand it, so I'm saying goodbye today

541
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,640
You are still adult.

542
00:35:55,672 --> 00:35:58,987
You told me that you would get married  with me someday.

543
00:35:59,799 --> 00:36:01,514
What are you talking about?

544
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:03,836
No...

545
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,527
Let's meet at the hotel tonight'.

546
00:36:10,921 --> 00:36:11,674
No.

547
00:36:19,818 --> 00:36:22,118
What?, I can't accept this.

548
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:24,025
Get the invoice together.

549
00:36:34,441 --> 00:36:36,440
but it's better if you break up.

550
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,668
I wondered why you stuck with him.

551
00:36:40,278 --> 00:36:41,930
When I was heartbroken,

552
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:44,737
He said something so kind to me that I couldn't resist

553
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:45,726
I'll forget about her.

554
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,749
Come on, have a drink and put on some cake

555
00:36:55,734 --> 00:36:56,480
I can't drink.

556
00:36:56,513 --> 00:36:58,766
Alcohol is just like water so let's have a toast

557
00:37:00,693 --> 00:37:02,289
For your second life.

558
00:37:06,001 --> 00:37:09,981
What are you doing next?

559
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:12,846
I wanna do something with 1 million yen.

560
00:37:12,871 --> 00:37:15,300
The chief gave you that money for breaking up?

561
00:37:15,738 --> 00:37:18,680
No.
He didn't pay me anything.

562
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:21,310
I even paid for the hotel

563
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:24,676
My father was given 500,000
yen each when he retired.

564
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,530
He's a good dad

565
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,050
And I have 150,000 in savings

566
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:31,112
I'll get about 150,000
yen in retirement benefits,

567
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:32,714
so that'll be 800,000 yen

568
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,184
Plus I can borrow another 100,000 yen from my sister

569
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,911
My youngest sis started a loan sharking business.

570
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:45,088
Wanna be madam at cafe?

571
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:48,780
There's a place in this neighborhood that sells drinks for 700,000 yen

572
00:37:48,816 --> 00:37:53,288
Apparently she's planning to leave and get married soon

573
00:37:54,128 --> 00:37:56,245
I wonder if I can work at a coffee shop.

574
00:37:56,291 --> 00:38:01,139
Yes, it's possible, you're beautiful

575
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,741
Hurry up and go now
you still have the qualifications.

576
00:38:07,154 --> 00:38:08,533
Behind that movie theater

577
00:38:18,878 --> 00:38:19,652
Here.

578
00:38:23,257 --> 00:38:24,069
Welcome here.

579
00:38:25,554 --> 00:38:27,825
Let me introduce you
She's classmate Mizusawa Kazuyo

580
00:38:27,904 --> 00:38:29,752
Nice to meet you.

581
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:31,150
I came here about the store,

582
00:38:31,805 --> 00:38:35,019
Please come in and sit there.

583
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:36,706
I talked her about this cafe.

584
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:38,950
two coffees.

585
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:46,799
Actually, I was able to start this business with the little bit of money my husband left me and the insurance money

586
00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:48,929
it's going well.

587
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:51,720
but I didn't intend to continue it forever

588
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,330
and I was planning to remarry if I found a good partner

589
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:56,484
I was just doing it to bridge the gap until then

590
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,748
When my husband passed away, he told me to definitely remarry

591
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,482
I don't like being independent either

592
00:39:03,965 --> 00:39:07,768
I like rely on someone
like this.

593
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,349
Are you sure?

594
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,212
However, I recently heard a wonderful offer about someone I was taking care of.

595
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:15,824
Excuse me.

596
00:39:18,767 --> 00:39:20,480
Here it is.

597
00:39:22,601 --> 00:39:24,494
Are you Mitsusawa-san or something?

598
00:39:24,668 --> 00:39:26,648
I'm Mitsusawa Kazuyo.

599
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:28,851
Where do you live?

600
00:39:29,004 --> 00:39:30,250
Kichijoji

601
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,986
What is the name of that father?

602
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:32,680
Heitaro

603
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:38,363
Heitaro Oh, really?

604
00:39:40,183 --> 00:39:41,556
I see.

605
00:39:43,959 --> 00:39:45,150
Is that so?

606
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:51,010
You are Misawa-san. I understand. I will own you this shop to a cheaper one

607
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:57,409
Hey! Mizusawa-kun!

608
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:01,915
 Mizusawa-san

609
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:03,959
Is that really impossible?

610
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,970
100,000 yen is outrageous

611
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,033
Don't underestimate me.

612
00:40:07,058 --> 00:40:10,570
Whether good or bad, it's
about helping people.

613
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,934
Anyway, let's have some tea!

614
00:40:17,689 --> 00:40:22,554
Masasuke Imagami and Kiyoko Nozawa can get married with just 100,000 yen

615
00:40:23,158 --> 00:40:25,943
it really cost 100,000 yen for the apartment
deposit and the minimum wedding expenses

616
00:40:25,968 --> 00:40:27,477
They don't have to get married.

617
00:40:27,665 --> 00:40:28,615
Even if you say that

618
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,805
It's been two years since thy started dating

619
00:40:29,843 --> 00:40:31,749
It's none of my business.

620
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:33,853
I hate the calm manner.

621
00:40:34,323 --> 00:40:37,420
This is the way I do business.

622
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:38,866
I'll be their guarantor, so why not?

623
00:40:38,898 --> 00:40:40,660
You're the guarantor, so I can't trust you

624
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,190
Now I can bear the insults no matter what people say

625
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:48,268
The two of them are married and work together, Monthly income will be 30,000 yen

626
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,580
From that amount, they pay back 5,000 yen every month

627
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,730
With the bonus, they can probably get back 20,000 yen

628
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:56,657
With just your feelings, a happy couple can be born into this world

629
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,278
Your money is also important,

630
00:40:59,302 --> 00:41:01,830
so how much money can you
making by getting in between them ?

631
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,277
Am I making money? That's rude

632
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,791
You know I'm not bad guy.

633
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:08,275
Because you are too enthusiastic

634
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,012
That's because we're friends.

635
00:41:10,036 --> 00:41:12,500
Male friendship is a big thing

636
00:41:12,593 --> 00:41:16,573
There is a saying that if you see someone being kind, you are not kind

637
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,723
They are here now.

638
00:41:19,867 --> 00:41:23,274
We are here.

639
00:41:28,871 --> 00:41:29,471
Hey.

640
00:41:30,117 --> 00:41:32,281
We were supposed to meet here at 4 o'clock

641
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:40,208
This is Shinako Mizusawa.

642
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:45,631
This is Shosuke Imazeki, this is Kiyoko Noda.
Have a seat.

643
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:50,270
Now, Mizusawa-san has kindly agreed

644
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,570
I'm relieved too

645
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,622
Could you please say thank her.

646
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,106
I'm sorry for worrying you.

647
00:41:56,379 --> 00:42:01,219
That's very helpful. Thank you very much

648
00:42:01,446 --> 00:42:02,653
No at all.

649
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,730
now that it's come to this

650
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:07,133
I'll treat you to dinner tonight.

651
00:42:07,418 --> 00:42:08,580
Okay, okay, let's go out

652
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,010
Let’s talk there.

653
00:42:11,692 --> 00:42:13,238
Thank you very much.

654
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,717
I'll take 230 yen. Please wait a moment

655
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:24,016
Mitsuzawa.

656
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:26,965
What?

657
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:34,049
Sorry, I need about 2000 yen

658
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:35,453
What do you mean?

659
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:37,220
I only have 100 yen.

660
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,466
I'll write the written acknowledgment of debt tomorrow

661
00:42:43,288 --> 00:42:44,821
Thank you very much.

662
00:42:47,417 --> 00:42:50,150
 I want to meet your bros.

663
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:51,778
Yes, eventually

664
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,646
eventually?
Please meet my dad.

665
00:42:57,810 --> 00:43:01,635
I hear your sisters got 500,000 yen each, right?

666
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:03,094
Yes,

667
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,620
I wonder if one of them
could lend me 500,000 yen

668
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,576
What's wrong?

669
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,615
I just lent you 500,000 yen

670
00:43:13,443 --> 00:43:17,479
The cashier at my brother's store took it and ran away all.

671
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:25,030
I will have my brother write an IOU and pay you interest.

672
00:43:25,072 --> 00:43:26,966
I can't tell everyone that

673
00:43:26,991 --> 00:43:29,008
It's impossible, absolutely impossible,

674
00:43:29,466 --> 00:43:31,032
that's probably true

675
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,620
That would be impossible

676
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,059
Are you upset?

677
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:44,356
What should we do?

678
00:43:50,652 --> 00:43:52,092
If this is the case,

679
00:43:52,323 --> 00:43:54,967
we'll just get married without anyone to stop us

680
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,639
Or do you not love me that much?

681
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,618
Well then, that's okay?

682
00:44:16,441 --> 00:44:18,134
Good evening

683
00:44:25,676 --> 00:44:26,250
Who are you?

684
00:44:26,598 --> 00:44:27,285
It's none of my business.

685
00:44:27,858 --> 00:44:28,631
You're rude.

686
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:30,750
You've been following us.

687
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,006
Oh no, I was just taking a walk,

688
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:34,910
now go home

689
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,521
I've seen your last moments,

690
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:37,561
so I know it's none of your business.

691
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:39,395
Get out!

692
00:44:41,996 --> 00:44:43,852
Don't hit me.

693
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:49,965
Hey.
Are you alright?

694
00:44:52,273 --> 00:44:53,366
You're evil.

695
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:54,823
Sorry.

696
00:44:55,854 --> 00:44:56,707
Did it hurt?

697
00:44:57,942 --> 00:45:00,384
Are you in love with her?

698
00:45:03,982 --> 00:45:05,569
No matter how much you fall in love with her,it's pointless.

699
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:06,588
Is that so?

700
00:45:06,612 --> 00:45:08,845
Let's go home, Remember,

701
00:45:08,870 --> 00:45:11,374
oh, I'll remember It's a pleasant memory

702
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:15,240
Well then, take care of yourself. Oh, it's nothing

703
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:45,829
They are late

704
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,526
I made sweet red bean soup.

705
00:45:49,846 --> 00:45:50,886
 I'm grateful

706
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,602
I can't make it as well as my mother,

707
00:45:56,595 --> 00:45:58,195
 but it's all good

708
00:45:59,932 --> 00:46:01,931
Next month is the 7th anniversary of my mother's death

709
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:04,135
Yes.

710
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:07,592
So you're going to hold the memorial service in Kyoto?

711
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:09,600
Yes.

712
00:46:10,917 --> 00:46:13,268
I'm sorry for making you play the role of a mother for so long,

713
00:46:14,117 --> 00:46:16,202
but I like being at home.

714
00:46:16,296 --> 00:46:17,063
It tastes good.

715
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:19,092
Well, I'm glad.

716
00:46:21,545 --> 00:46:25,882
You see, I met Endo-kun today

717
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,605
I heard Yoshiki is going to France.

718
00:46:28,629 --> 00:46:31,198
I know. It's fine

719
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:32,749
I don't have anything anymore

720
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:34,661
Really?

721
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:40,067
I'm sure it's not a big deal, but it would be nice if you said that

722
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:43,085
I don't care

723
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:47,320
This is the second time I've beaten you

724
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,803
Don't lose confidence, it's not your fault

725
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:56,220
When Inaba-kun got engaged to you

726
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:59,816
I thought you were the first to be happy in this house

727
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:05,887
However, Inaba-kun unilaterally rejected  marriage the day before the wedding.He's bad

728
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:15,962
At that time, Endo's son became
close to you and sympathized with you,

729
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:17,929
It made me very happy

730
00:47:21,753 --> 00:47:25,712
Endo and I are colleagues who joined the company on the same day

731
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:31,480
One of them will be the senior managing director and I will retire as a section chief

732
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:36,250
However, as a person I don't think I was inferior to Endo

733
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,525
I thought I had walked my own path straight and proudly

734
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:40,333
Yes.

735
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,430
However, Endo doesn't like my existence

736
00:47:43,877 --> 00:47:46,260
I didn't want to marry my daughter,

737
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:48,040
who is an ordinary retired man, to their son.

738
00:47:48,276 --> 00:47:51,980
Dad, let's not talking about him.

739
00:47:55,139 --> 00:48:00,039
I don't want to be excited because my blood pressure goes up when I get excited

740
00:48:19,915 --> 00:48:21,128
Welcome

741
00:48:21,809 --> 00:48:22,949
Hello,

742
00:48:23,302 --> 00:48:26,389
I've been waiting for you. Come in

743
00:48:34,855 --> 00:48:36,041
Excuse me.

744
00:48:49,005 --> 00:48:51,389
This is 3rd sis,Miyako.

745
00:48:51,421 --> 00:48:52,609
I'm Yasuko Aizawa.

746
00:48:52,757 --> 00:48:53,948
Nice to meet you.

747
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:56,964
Hold on.

748
00:48:57,494 --> 00:48:58,429
Come with me.

749
00:49:04,356 --> 00:49:05,016
Where's Fumi?

750
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,863
She's washing.

751
00:49:06,007 --> 00:49:06,787
Call her.

752
00:49:16,073 --> 00:49:17,706
Why were you here?

753
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:21,911
I listened to Mood music,I like the atmosphere.

754
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,573
She's here.

755
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:27,523
What kind of person is she?

756
00:49:27,961 --> 00:49:29,499
She has bright personality

757
00:49:31,532 --> 00:49:33,969
Ah, I guess we need to buy a new washing machine after all

758
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,458
It's a step backwards from civilization.

759
00:49:40,778 --> 00:49:43,185
Nice to meet you, I'm the youngest, Shinako.

760
00:49:43,291 --> 00:49:44,958
I'm Yasuko Aizawa.

761
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:48,589
It's a nice Sunday

762
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:53,360
I was supposed to go to Enoshima and see the whales today,

763
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:54,750
but I got stuck there

764
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:55,470
Because

765
00:49:55,495 --> 00:49:56,763
There's an aunt here, right?

766
00:49:56,905 --> 00:49:58,218
Don't call like that.

767
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:00,737
It's ok.

768
00:50:01,503 --> 00:50:05,206
I'm not a young lady anymore, so I'm sorry for the whale.

769
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,086
Don't worry.

770
00:50:07,516 --> 00:50:10,366
You're too young to have big kids

771
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:12,220
It seems too good for daddy.

772
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,183
Oh my, maybe it's me who is the wasteful for him.

773
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,147
Have a tea.

774
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,254
Do you like jazz?

775
00:50:23,285 --> 00:50:24,201
I love it

776
00:50:24,245 --> 00:50:26,398
I played the violin when I was young

777
00:50:26,445 --> 00:50:27,222
Really?

778
00:50:29,424 --> 00:50:30,344
You were cool.

779
00:50:30,883 --> 00:50:33,876
I bought  MJC's new record, but will you listen?

780
00:50:34,143 --> 00:50:35,295
Don't say that.

781
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,715
Please call me, Dad.

782
00:50:36,962 --> 00:50:37,809
Okay

783
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:45,280
Ah, what do I have to call him?

784
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,471
we had a meeting last night, right?

785
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,765
Ah, okay

786
00:50:57,549 --> 00:50:58,361
Are you working?

787
00:51:08,646 --> 00:51:10,159
I can't write well

788
00:51:10,410 --> 00:51:11,317
What?

789
00:51:11,863 --> 00:51:15,930
I was asked to write for the in-house magazine at
my previous company, even though I was retiring

790
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:18,040
Well, let's see.

791
00:51:19,052 --> 00:51:23,280
When I looked at people who retired in my youth,

792
00:51:23,509 --> 00:51:27,914
I used to think they were an old man who reached the end of life

793
00:51:28,050 --> 00:51:31,950
but now that I'm in that position,

794
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:34,470
I don't think it's that bad at all

795
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,162
I like this phrases.

796
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,005
My son's mother said that I might get married

797
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:43,390
Then he told me what will happen to me

798
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,690
Well, of course I'll take you with me

799
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:50,028
He thinks it's better to have a dad too

800
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:52,995
She's Fumiko, the second one

801
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:55,930
Welcome, nice to meet you

802
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:58,801
I think you have good sweater.

803
00:52:00,243 --> 00:52:02,363
It's better to wash this my hand.

804
00:52:02,615 --> 00:52:05,080
It's good exercise too.

805
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:07,117
it helps to keep you in good condition

806
00:52:07,142 --> 00:52:08,895
The motor in my washing machine went out,

807
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,620
so we had to choose between buying a new one or throw it out.

808
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,322
After a month of deliberation, we decided to throw it out.

809
00:52:25,521 --> 00:52:26,145
Come on.

810
00:52:31,136 --> 00:52:32,083
Dad's here

811
00:52:39,475 --> 00:52:41,799
She's My friend, Yasuko Aizawa

812
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,339
Welcome.

813
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:47,420
Hello, I'm Yasuko Aizawa. I'm sorry to bother you

814
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:49,250
Today is Sunday so she came to play

815
00:52:49,945 --> 00:52:51,150
She helps me a lot.

816
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,305
Thank you

817
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,177
Please, please

818
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:13,327
Want a cigarette?

819
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:14,967
Thank you very much

820
00:53:20,204 --> 00:53:21,277
Thank you very much

821
00:53:27,398 --> 00:53:30,947
This area is really quiet and nice

822
00:53:34,909 --> 00:53:36,830
Sometime raccoon appeared.

823
00:53:36,830 --> 00:53:38,965
Five or six years ago.

824
00:53:39,234 --> 00:53:41,580
You talk so big.

825
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:43,255
Is that bad?

826
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:48,142
Yes, there are. It seems that there may still
be remnants of the Musashino Tanuki around here

827
00:53:48,336 --> 00:53:51,570
I have heard such a story too

828
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:53,840
That's right, even
raccoons have a desire to survive

829
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,433
I will resist civilization.

830
00:53:55,504 --> 00:53:57,700
Wanna eat apple or

831
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:58,965
persimmon?

832
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,422
Take both.

833
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:06,199
Umi-chan and Nishina-chan

834
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:13,850
How are you guys trying to attract attention?

835
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,032
It can't be helped.

836
00:54:15,057 --> 00:54:16,670
You are not good to do a play.

837
00:54:16,695 --> 00:54:17,688
Sorry

838
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,442
She looks nice.

839
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,460
She's not thick.

840
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:28,230
She is magnificent.

841
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,698
She's not arrogant at all.

842
00:54:30,841 --> 00:54:31,828
what do you think?

843
00:54:31,853 --> 00:54:33,615
I think I could like her.

844
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,026
Oh, um, would you like one more cigarette?

845
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:40,871
That's fine

846
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:42,912
Is that so?

847
00:54:45,622 --> 00:54:47,662
Well...

848
00:54:52,996 --> 00:54:53,842
Thanks.

849
00:54:59,453 --> 00:55:01,517
I feel like my life just passing by

850
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,646
It's not over yet, is it?

851
00:55:04,853 --> 00:55:05,659
It's over.

852
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,971
It's just the beginning

853
00:55:08,516 --> 00:55:10,009
People say that as a compliment.

854
00:55:10,168 --> 00:55:14,574
Apparently the age of death for men has now been extended to 70,

855
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:15,939
so is that right?

856
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:17,253
Yes.

857
00:55:26,543 --> 00:55:28,150
I'd met you before.

858
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:32,005
Oh I remember

859
00:56:19,871 --> 00:56:20,504
What?

860
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,265
He's embarrassed so

861
00:56:29,290 --> 00:56:30,703
He's pretending to be upset.

862
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:34,641
Don't you think she'd be suit for father?

863
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:36,745
But she's got a kid.

864
00:56:36,777 --> 00:56:39,152
It might be fun to have another little brother

865
00:56:39,177 --> 00:56:40,371
What about you, Miya?

866
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,109
I just want to make my dad happy

867
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:14,445
Affairs Department

868
00:57:17,301 --> 00:57:20,625
Hello, hello, this is Affairs Department

869
00:57:21,169 --> 00:57:22,088
Ishibe?

870
00:57:22,396 --> 00:57:23,463
I'm Mitsuzawa.

871
00:57:23,989 --> 00:57:26,768
I'm sorry for the other day.

872
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,750
There's something I want to talk to you about

873
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,326
Please come to the rooftop during lunch time

874
00:57:31,613 --> 00:57:33,480
Wanna have a lunch together?

875
00:57:33,832 --> 00:57:34,845
You're annoying.

876
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,553
I would like to enjoy having meal with you.

877
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,312
How about some eel?

878
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,569
First, 200 yen, 250 yen, plum, 300 yen

879
00:57:46,806 --> 00:57:48,468
There's no need to force yourself.

880
00:57:48,732 --> 00:57:50,870
Let's wait for the next one

881
00:57:50,894 --> 00:57:51,867
What do you mean?

882
00:57:52,066 --> 00:57:53,798
 I've been hoping to have more
opportunities like this with you from now on

883
00:57:53,823 --> 00:57:54,778
I'm sorry,

884
00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:56,601
I thought you'd say that.

885
00:57:56,626 --> 00:57:58,512
Why did you do that?

886
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:00,205
Because I like you.

887
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:01,172
Wait a moment

888
00:58:01,789 --> 00:58:03,900
I love you and I want to marry you

889
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:04,970
I refuse it.

890
00:58:04,970 --> 00:58:05,440
Why?

891
00:58:05,464 --> 00:58:08,150
What do you mean why?
I have someone special

892
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:12,300
That guy is a loser. He works for Sumida Industries, one of our clients

893
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:13,139
You know very much.

894
00:58:13,307 --> 00:58:14,885
I know his authorities.

895
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:16,382
Sorry, he has bad reputation.

896
00:58:16,415 --> 00:58:17,829
Excuse me. this is a human rights
issue

897
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:18,617
Thank you for waiting

898
00:58:18,642 --> 00:58:20,081
let's eat eel

899
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,690
What's so good about a guy like that?

900
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:27,190
He's kind and caring

901
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:29,940
and not at all creepy like you.

902
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,011
Please leave me alone.

903
00:58:31,035 --> 00:58:32,120
I can't leave you alone

904
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,170
Those who love have the right and the duty to protect the object of their love

905
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:36,690
it's a matter of rights and responsibilities?

906
00:58:36,749 --> 00:58:38,017
but I know it's a tough one for men

907
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:41,130
but I'm already engaged

908
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,370
But you're not married yet

909
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:45,285
I think I followed you that night and stole you.

910
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:47,020
You probably don't think

911
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,260
I go to places like that all the time?

912
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,480
I'm relieved to see you're still inexperienced,

913
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,752
so you're still a virgin

914
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:58,737
However, you seemed quite psychologically unstable

915
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,227
From now on, don't fall for that guy's words

916
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:01,794
It's none of your business.

917
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:05,519
No you can't. for your happiness and for my happiness too

918
00:59:05,579 --> 00:59:08,249
Well then, let me tell you

919
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,720
how much I fuss over your hairy heart

920
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,130
You don't want to hear it

921
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,140
No, I'll tell you

922
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,560
If you beg so much, I'll listen

923
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:18,535
I received 500,000 yen from my father and lent it to that person

924
00:59:18,653 --> 00:59:19,030
Why?

925
00:59:19,063 --> 00:59:20,135
Because I love him.

926
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,710
You see?

927
00:59:20,832 --> 00:59:24,129
You're stupid, you're such a fool

928
00:59:43,501 --> 00:59:44,510
Have you finished?

929
00:59:44,535 --> 00:59:47,577
What happened? I haven't finished yet.

930
00:59:54,293 --> 00:59:55,869
Thank you for your hard work

931
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:08,613
Yes, hello

932
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:10,167
For you.

933
01:00:16,706 --> 01:00:18,455
Hello, this is Mitsusawa

934
01:00:20,906 --> 01:00:21,291
Aizawa-san?

935
01:00:22,821 --> 01:00:24,614
Which Aizawa-san are you talking about?

936
01:00:24,883 --> 01:00:26,535
Oh, you forgot?

937
01:00:29,103 --> 01:00:33,294
Oh my god. Where did we meet?

938
01:00:33,616 --> 01:00:36,623
I'm Aizawa who visited you last Sunday.

939
01:00:39,188 --> 01:00:40,668
I'm sorry

940
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:42,751
Did you remember me?

941
01:00:43,353 --> 01:00:45,753
Thank you very much.

942
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:52,226
Could you please spare me about an hour tonight?

943
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:55,810
But what do you want?

944
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:59,780
I'll save that for when we meet so I won't tell you about it now

945
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:04,369
Please come to the cafe called "Akai Tobira" in Shibuya at 8:30

946
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:07,208
This is the cafe that opened today

947
01:01:08,910 --> 01:01:10,520
It's a red door

948
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:11,773
Please

949
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:17,095
I wonder if my dad will be angry if I
start a cafe like this without telling him

950
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:17,893
Why?

951
01:01:18,085 --> 01:01:21,459
Because it started with your own ability, so don't worry.

952
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:24,056
but I've been very grateful to you

953
01:01:24,323 --> 01:01:25,663
Same here.

954
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,293
Welcome.

955
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:30,426
You finally opened.

956
01:01:30,472 --> 01:01:33,599
You're the first customer.

957
01:01:33,727 --> 01:01:37,866
Thanks for doing the renovations so inexpensively.

958
01:01:37,933 --> 01:01:39,986
Not at all.

959
01:01:41,043 --> 01:01:43,767
We're lucky that, There's an interior designer on the second floor

960
01:01:44,055 --> 01:01:45,285
The trouble with this person is

961
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:48,676
He order curry rice at a coffee shop

962
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:50,630
Are you still eating curry rice?

963
01:01:50,837 --> 01:01:52,057
Yes please.

964
01:01:52,408 --> 01:01:53,968
That's good.

965
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:56,656
Thanks.

966
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:59,709
You should hurry up to get married.

967
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,760
I think I'll find a good man soon.

968
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:03,920
Yes?

969
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:09,020
 my daughters are encouraging me to remarry

970
01:02:09,190 --> 01:02:10,210
That would be nice

971
01:02:10,235 --> 01:02:13,235
but the woman is strangely unresponsive.

972
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,433
I wonder who she is.

973
01:02:15,576 --> 01:02:17,523
She's too open.

974
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:18,678
I think that's pretty good.

975
01:02:19,471 --> 01:02:21,622
How can you understand if you don't even see her?

976
01:02:22,815 --> 01:02:25,810
No, we are always responding to requests

977
01:02:26,147 --> 01:02:27,258
I just wanted to say something about the world

978
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:28,904
Do you have a girlfriend?

979
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:31,771
No, I'm enjoying my freedom.

980
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,790
I have a daughter after all

981
01:02:35,080 --> 01:02:36,179
Would you like to come
and hang out for a bit?

982
01:02:36,625 --> 01:02:38,664
I pretty much understand what you mean

983
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,379
Don’t they all already have a lover?

984
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:47,893
Hello, please wait a moment

985
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,470
Again, from a woman

986
01:02:51,688 --> 01:02:52,281
Again?

987
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,815
You're popular among women.

988
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:59,840
Hey, hey, you shouldn't make fun of old people

989
01:02:59,840 --> 01:03:02,020
Hello, this is Mitsusawa

990
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:06,645
Yes, Mi-san, I'm Tamako

991
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:12,075
I'm sorry for the other day.
Are you upset?

992
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:16,250
But I still like you the best.

993
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,240
I want you.

994
01:03:20,989 --> 01:03:22,562
What can I do for you?

995
01:03:23,256 --> 01:03:25,286
I wanna meet you.

996
01:03:25,875 --> 01:03:31,192
Please come over tonight, even if it's just for a little while, I'll give you a special service

997
01:03:31,670 --> 01:03:34,208
OK?
I'm happy.

998
01:03:34,585 --> 01:03:38,683
See you, oh yeah, the store has changed

999
01:03:39,090 --> 01:03:43,438
Shibuya Shibuya Touhou Fugetsu

1000
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:45,790
Eh, not Daiei?

1001
01:03:45,790 --> 01:03:48,282
Oh, I get it,

1002
01:03:49,516 --> 01:03:51,870
there are too many movie theaters

1003
01:03:51,895 --> 01:03:56,142
Seriously, let's go out together tonight.

1004
01:03:56,685 --> 01:03:58,411
Sake or anything?

1005
01:03:58,945 --> 01:03:59,585
Both.

1006
01:03:59,859 --> 01:04:01,219
That's fine.

1007
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:08,167
He's there?

1008
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,587
Welcome.

1009
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:26,970
Mi-san, it's been a while. I missed you

1010
01:04:26,970 --> 01:04:30,060
Hey, stop talking like this. It's Tatsuta from work

1011
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,980
Pleased to meet you. I was lonely

1012
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,850
Well, you know, I'll have some alcohol and food

1013
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:39,361
Yes, take it easy tonight

1014
01:04:44,911 --> 01:04:45,778
How's her?

1015
01:04:48,853 --> 01:04:51,063
Wow, she really loves you.

1016
01:04:51,130 --> 01:04:54,610
But you have to be careful with your wallet

1017
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:56,745
Do you understand why I don't want to remarry?

1018
01:04:58,209 --> 01:04:58,869
Huh? Yes,

1019
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:01,555
I don't want to remarry and have my wife be jealous.

1020
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:04,430
and I don't wanna waste time I have left of my life

1021
01:05:04,430 --> 01:05:06,400
So I don't get re-married.

1022
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,730
But isn't it okay because there is no freedom in life?

1023
01:05:09,453 --> 01:05:12,942
You're young but you have no sense, do you?

1024
01:05:12,967 --> 01:05:15,160
Open the door.

1025
01:05:18,608 --> 01:05:20,633
Please excuse me

1026
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:26,561
Your section chief is really kind,

1027
01:05:26,586 --> 01:05:28,145
he's not the section chief anymore.

1028
01:05:28,493 --> 01:05:30,313
You're so kind to other women too?

1029
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:31,585
Don't say that.

1030
01:05:31,610 --> 01:05:33,698
He all knows about me well.

1031
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:36,036
Have a sake.

1032
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:38,760
No,
Tatsuta is guest tonight, so please go ahead

1033
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,200
Oh yeah, have a sake first.

1034
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,753
Well then, please feel free to have some.

1035
01:05:52,517 --> 01:05:55,415
Hey, let me have some too.

1036
01:05:56,946 --> 01:05:58,537
Thank you so much.

1037
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:02,961
You know what?

1038
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:05,580
What's wrong?

1039
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,568
Do you know why I called you today?

1040
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:09,740
I don't know.

1041
01:06:09,764 --> 01:06:12,935
You don't know?
You're mean.

1042
01:06:12,988 --> 01:06:14,562
Stop it....

1043
01:06:15,023 --> 01:06:21,397
I saw a dream about you.

1044
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:25,350
This was a very embarrassing dream.

1045
01:06:26,071 --> 01:06:27,390
What kind of dream was it?

1046
01:06:27,422 --> 01:06:28,208
Guess that.

1047
01:06:29,582 --> 01:06:38,305
When I woke up, I missed you so much and loved
you so much.

1048
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:41,430
I called Mi-san today, prepared to be scolded

1049
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,460
Then you don't get angry at all

1050
01:06:44,485 --> 01:06:47,700
This is how you came here

1051
01:06:47,741 --> 01:06:51,100
I won't leave you from me anymore.

1052
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,715
I’m sorry.

1053
01:06:52,814 --> 01:06:53,453
What's the matter?

1054
01:06:53,987 --> 01:06:55,505
I want to go to the bathroom

1055
01:06:55,530 --> 01:06:57,362
It's okay if you go.

1056
01:06:57,387 --> 01:07:00,337
In the meantime, I want you to get as many important things done as possible

1057
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,536
Please.

1058
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:12,730
Where's is the bathroom?

1059
01:07:13,415 --> 01:07:15,154
In the back of the hallway.

1060
01:07:23,437 --> 01:07:24,237
Mi-san.

1061
01:07:25,043 --> 01:07:25,585
What?

1062
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:28,555
I can't really tell you

1063
01:07:28,580 --> 01:07:30,513
I'm embarrassed.

1064
01:08:31,653 --> 01:08:32,487
What happened?

1065
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:36,395
I'll talk to you later.

1066
01:08:36,419 --> 01:08:39,760
We'll go home then. I agree

1067
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:41,826
It's the perfect time for the Akai tobira cafe.

1068
01:08:44,265 --> 01:08:45,217
Bill please.

1069
01:08:50,386 --> 01:08:51,453
How much?

1070
01:08:51,673 --> 01:08:53,355
5,300 yen.

1071
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:56,477
It's too expensive.

1072
01:08:58,409 --> 01:08:59,302
Take your change.

1073
01:08:59,348 --> 01:09:01,718
Thank you.
Please come again.

1074
01:09:07,338 --> 01:09:08,605
What happened?

1075
01:09:09,195 --> 01:09:11,417
Tonight I finally understood the true identity of that woman

1076
01:09:11,940 --> 01:09:13,147
I must have looked pretty stupid, right?

1077
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:14,629
That's no good

1078
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:19,215
Is it true that it was a farce to discover the woman's true identity?

1079
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,704
Really?
You looked so enjoyable.

1080
01:09:22,145 --> 01:09:24,245
I wanted to find out the truth,

1081
01:09:24,275 --> 01:09:25,683
Were you able to find out?

1082
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:26,897
That's right,

1083
01:09:28,387 --> 01:09:32,861
that woman was trying to get me to pay 100,000 yen

1084
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,150
She has to do something with your wallet after all.

1085
01:09:36,358 --> 01:09:38,871
Apparently I look like a real amateur

1086
01:09:38,896 --> 01:09:40,456
I'm sure everyone can see you as nice man

1087
01:09:40,670 --> 01:09:42,366
Don't make fun of me.

1088
01:09:45,823 --> 01:09:46,643
Here?

1089
01:09:46,716 --> 01:09:47,836
Yes.

1090
01:09:48,802 --> 01:09:51,026
I see, it's a red door.

1091
01:09:51,624 --> 01:09:52,377
Welcome

1092
01:09:53,112 --> 01:09:54,285
Welcome

1093
01:09:56,022 --> 01:09:59,259
We've been waiting for you. Please come in

1094
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:05,080
Dad, you are late.
Let him sit there.

1095
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:06,169
What's wrong?

1096
01:10:06,228 --> 01:10:09,316
Everyone, today is the opening celebration.
Here's Kazuya's cafe.

1097
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,076
Kazuyo's?

1098
01:10:13,161 --> 01:10:15,115
Dad, please hurry up.

1099
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,837
He's Ryukichi Takita who work together

1100
01:10:28,075 --> 01:10:30,050
Nice to meet you.

1101
01:10:31,254 --> 01:10:33,049
Please have a seat.

1102
01:10:38,063 --> 01:10:39,935
Let me introduce you.

1103
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,821
This is Mr. Sugimoto, who owns a decoration company here

1104
01:10:44,305 --> 01:10:45,831
He helped me this time.

1105
01:10:46,317 --> 01:10:47,297
I am Sugimoto

1106
01:10:47,685 --> 01:10:48,751
I am Mitsusawa .

1107
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:50,743
So, what happened to the company?

1108
01:10:50,928 --> 01:10:51,770
I quit.

1109
01:10:51,795 --> 01:10:53,105
I didn't ask you

1110
01:10:53,410 --> 01:10:54,870
What happened to this store?

1111
01:10:55,229 --> 01:10:58,395
Um, I gave my store away to her.

1112
01:10:58,468 --> 01:10:59,340
Your store?

1113
01:10:59,823 --> 01:11:02,003
My classmate used to run a bar nearby

1114
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:05,444
And the place I was introduced to was Mr. Aizawa's shop

1115
01:11:07,266 --> 01:11:09,185
You quit your job and
started a business like this.

1116
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:11,247
That's great business.

1117
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:12,599
Shut up.

1118
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,185
Why did you quit your job?

1119
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:17,940
I think it's good to be independent

1120
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,886
You are still a stranger,

1121
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:22,141
so don't be so casual about barging into my home

1122
01:11:22,214 --> 01:11:27,786
Dad, she started the business with that 500,000 yen, so isn't that okay?

1123
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:29,543
That 500,000?

1124
01:11:30,743 --> 01:11:31,590
Yes

1125
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,640
I shouldn't have shared that money

1126
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,001
You are not being realistic.

1127
01:11:37,303 --> 01:11:39,215
 it doesn't matter if I'm not being realistic or not.

1128
01:11:39,254 --> 01:11:42,210
Anyway, tonight is a happy night, so let's have a toast.

1129
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,141
Let's do it.

1130
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:44,952
I don't have a cup

1131
01:11:44,977 --> 01:11:47,314
Sorry, Bring a cup for him.

1132
01:11:47,345 --> 01:11:48,532
Tatsuta.

1133
01:11:48,910 --> 01:11:50,272
You're going to betray me?

1134
01:11:50,296 --> 01:11:52,105
But that's not what I mean

1135
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,530
I'm sorry.

1136
01:11:53,530 --> 01:11:56,020
I think I can drink better here than the restaurant we just went before.

1137
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:58,860
Oh,Were you drinking somewhere?

1138
01:11:58,885 --> 01:11:59,442
No..

1139
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:00,848
We just had some coffee.

1140
01:12:01,268 --> 01:12:02,634
Yes.

1141
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:04,335
but that coffee was no good

1142
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,983
It's expensive and very bitter.

1143
01:12:06,434 --> 01:12:08,149
You should have come here.

1144
01:12:08,385 --> 01:12:11,624
The coffee is also very delicious, isn't it? Let's have a toast

1145
01:12:11,649 --> 01:12:15,060
Yes, let's have a toast. Congratulations

1146
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:15,822
Thank you

1147
01:12:20,193 --> 01:12:21,193
Welcome.

1148
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,455
Sorry we are closed.

1149
01:12:30,127 --> 01:12:31,947
but it seems that it's opening today.

1150
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:40,630
Good evening.

1151
01:12:40,630 --> 01:12:43,253
Sorry, we've closed the shop for the night.

1152
01:12:44,390 --> 01:12:46,511
but you have a lot of customers there.

1153
01:12:46,843 --> 01:12:48,751
They're very special people

1154
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,383
I guess I deserve some special treatment too

1155
01:12:58,606 --> 01:13:01,054
I refuse. Please go home.

1156
01:13:01,078 --> 01:13:02,468
Don't say things like that

1157
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,440
I want to drink beer too

1158
01:13:04,482 --> 01:13:05,248
Hey you.

1159
01:13:07,415 --> 01:13:08,700
If you want to drink beer,

1160
01:13:08,700 --> 01:13:10,509
there are standing bars around here

1161
01:13:10,613 --> 01:13:11,720
Mind your own business.

1162
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:13,859
You are an unnecessary customer

1163
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,567
Do you know what kind of guy I am?

1164
01:13:16,648 --> 01:13:17,648
No, not at all

1165
01:13:17,756 --> 01:13:21,102
I was the manager of the company where she worked.

1166
01:13:21,127 --> 01:13:24,327
Really? Then you must want to become a manager soon.

1167
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,140
Okay, let me say.

1168
01:13:26,340 --> 01:13:27,314
With her...

1169
01:13:29,364 --> 01:13:32,276
If you continue talking, I will charge you.

1170
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:35,224
it will affect to her.

1171
01:13:35,802 --> 01:13:36,621
Hey you.

1172
01:13:41,270 --> 01:13:43,011
That's enough now, go home

1173
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:45,018
What's the matter?

1174
01:13:45,936 --> 01:13:46,431
nothing.

1175
01:13:47,495 --> 01:13:50,023
That woman and I are...

1176
01:13:50,737 --> 01:13:52,083
What's the hell?

1177
01:13:58,585 --> 01:13:59,727
Hold on.

1178
01:14:01,898 --> 01:14:02,972
Hold on.

1179
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:25,662
I think you know the reason I left the company.

1180
01:14:35,818 --> 01:14:38,330
Congratulations Iwasaki-kun and congratulations Kiyoko-san

1181
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,630
Everyone has already congratulated them.

1182
01:14:40,655 --> 01:14:42,188
I have nothing more to say

1183
01:14:42,670 --> 01:14:45,988
I'm just jealous, he's a lucky guy

1184
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:51,525
I'll end this by confessing that I want to get married as soon as possible

1185
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:03,936
Next, I would like to ask Shinako Mitsusawa to speech.

1186
01:15:04,390 --> 01:15:06,543
Oh, I'm in trouble.

1187
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:07,451
Do it.

1188
01:15:09,030 --> 01:15:11,320
No problem, you're the sponsor

1189
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,666
We need to speech.

1190
01:15:14,766 --> 01:15:15,233
Excuse me.

1191
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:19,365
Before Ms. Misawa, I would like to say a few words

1192
01:15:22,651 --> 01:15:29,570
To be honest, the hardest part about
getting married was finding an apartment

1193
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:32,340
I was renting the second floor of my brother's house

1194
01:15:32,340 --> 01:15:35,640
This Noda guy is a little strange

1195
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:36,191
Kiyoko..

1196
01:15:36,237 --> 01:15:38,519
Don't push yourself too hard.

1197
01:15:38,556 --> 01:15:40,669
She's being looked after by her uncle

1198
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:45,004
To rent an apartment, a deposit of 100,000 yen was required

1199
01:15:45,565 --> 01:15:49,425
In other words, Nobuko Misawa lent us the 100,000 yen

1200
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,692
we needed it for our wedding

1201
01:15:57,782 --> 01:16:04,762
The 100,000 yen was something she had received
from her father's retirement pension as a wedding fund

1202
01:16:05,526 --> 01:16:09,883
We intend to pay the money back within a year

1203
01:16:10,715 --> 01:16:13,635
Please Mitsuzawa-san, please don't get married within a year

1204
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,160
That's terrible! No, no,

1205
01:16:16,176 --> 01:16:18,045
no, no! I'm not saying never

1206
01:16:18,076 --> 01:16:21,737
I ask you to take responsibility for borrowing money for your wedding funds.

1207
01:16:23,390 --> 01:16:28,310
According to Hirose-kun, the two of you plan to get married someday

1208
01:16:28,310 --> 01:16:30,750
If possible, I would like you to marry after a year

1209
01:16:35,005 --> 01:16:35,758
Hold on.

1210
01:16:39,777 --> 01:16:44,150
So, thank you so much for being so happy with my little bit of help

1211
01:16:44,150 --> 01:16:46,490
I think I did a really good thing

1212
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:53,000
But the thing about Hirose-san was a real surprise to me

1213
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,660
I will now revoke it again here

1214
01:16:56,660 --> 01:17:01,637
He drinks a lot and is the best in the world at making me snort

1215
01:17:02,223 --> 01:17:06,182
As for my opponent, He's a complete failure.

1216
01:17:08,585 --> 01:17:10,378
Chairman, please make an emergency motion.

1217
01:17:10,968 --> 01:17:13,805
I would like to give special
permission to speak.

1218
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,605
Thank you

1219
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:20,150
I would like to sue her for defamation regarding her statement just now

1220
01:17:20,150 --> 01:17:22,480
In fact, she was so embarrassed

1221
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,430
So She insulted to me.

1222
01:17:24,626 --> 01:17:26,755
and will not pursue a lawsuit

1223
01:17:28,222 --> 01:17:29,108
What's the hell?

1224
01:17:30,660 --> 01:17:34,167
We too will have a happy marriage like Imazeki-kun

1225
01:17:34,200 --> 01:17:35,380
Please look forward to it.

1226
01:17:41,033 --> 01:17:42,180
You shamed on me.

1227
01:17:42,253 --> 01:17:43,240


1228
01:17:43,493 --> 01:17:44,920
Can I not be angry about this too?

1229
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:47,650
You're trying to tear me apart?

1230
01:17:47,959 --> 01:17:49,690
You're the one who tore me apart

1231
01:17:49,844 --> 01:17:51,647
I feel like killing myself I was about to kill myself

1232
01:17:51,794 --> 01:17:55,440
Suicide?
You were exaggerating a lot.

1233
01:17:55,755 --> 01:17:57,429
Let's have a meal.
I'll treat you.

1234
01:17:57,454 --> 01:17:58,755
What's the hell?

1235
01:17:58,780 --> 01:17:59,862
You're borrowing money from me anyway,

1236
01:18:00,139 --> 01:18:01,492
It's ok because 10% daily interest.

1237
01:18:01,517 --> 01:18:02,491
I will write an IOU tomorrow.

1238
01:18:02,516 --> 01:18:03,065
I can't.

1239
01:18:03,344 --> 01:18:05,740
but if you lend it to me, you'll make money

1240
01:18:06,137 --> 01:18:08,503
I get it.
You're borrowing money from me,

1241
01:18:08,528 --> 01:18:13,771
and deceiving me, marrying me, and plotting to default on your debt in the name of marriage

1242
01:18:13,796 --> 01:18:16,086
Don't say such pathetic things

1243
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,695
Do I look like that bad man?

1244
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,810
If I have suck an idea, I'll be much more successful.

1245
01:18:19,810 --> 01:18:23,290
Anyway, I'm going to quit being a moneylender

1246
01:18:23,328 --> 01:18:24,055
You quit?

1247
01:18:24,156 --> 01:18:25,378
I'm in trouble.

1248
01:18:25,647 --> 01:18:31,847
If you want to improve your score even a little, never borrow money from me.

1249
01:18:32,728 --> 01:18:33,861
What's the hell?

1250
01:18:34,740 --> 01:18:36,133
What a shame for you to be so considerate

1251
01:18:36,198 --> 01:18:39,265
It's proof that your heart is turning to me.

1252
01:18:41,626 --> 01:18:42,493
What's wrong?

1253
01:19:05,572 --> 01:19:06,513
Hello!

1254
01:19:06,998 --> 01:19:08,391
Oh, it's you!

1255
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,967
You seem to be waiting for someone?

1256
01:19:15,690 --> 01:19:17,665
You must be waiting for Nagata-kun.

1257
01:19:21,712 --> 01:19:24,081
Could you please go to another table?

1258
01:19:24,298 --> 01:19:27,210
I get suffocated when I'm face to face with you

1259
01:19:27,246 --> 01:19:30,343
Ah, I'll leave as soon as Nagata arrives, so that's fine

1260
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,625
Ah, I'll get some coffee, bring it over there.

1261
01:19:36,820 --> 01:19:40,150
There's something I want to talk to you about regarding Nagata

1262
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,073
I don't want to hear any insults

1263
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,472
You haven't seen him lately,right?

1264
01:19:48,690 --> 01:19:50,190
He's busy for a reason.

1265
01:19:50,910 --> 01:19:52,700
He's getting married at the end of the month.

1266
01:19:52,945 --> 01:19:54,546
He's getting married?

1267
01:19:54,684 --> 01:19:55,780
That's exactly.

1268
01:19:57,354 --> 01:19:58,194
with me for sure.

1269
01:19:58,700 --> 01:19:59,980
But it's not true

1270
01:20:00,675 --> 01:20:07,325
He's going to get married with Fumiko Kimitsu, the daughter of the president of a financial trading company.

1271
01:20:07,350 --> 01:20:08,062
You're lying.

1272
01:20:08,139 --> 01:20:13,745
I did my research and he quit his current company and became the managing director of a financial trading company.

1273
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:19,209
It's a win-win situation because it helps my brother get promoted at his company and also helps me get promoted.

1274
01:20:19,663 --> 01:20:20,469
It's a lie

1275
01:20:20,630 --> 01:20:21,628
Who believe that?

1276
01:20:22,039 --> 01:20:23,986
Why you don't believe me?

1277
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:28,412
I didn't run around and investigated for you. See you later

1278
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:39,448
Did you wait long?

1279
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:42,230
more than 40 minutes.

1280
01:20:42,381 --> 01:20:43,154
I’m sorry.

1281
01:20:43,504 --> 01:20:47,357
I'm busy at work day time and take care of my bros at night.

1282
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:50,096
No matter how many times I call, you aren’t at home

1283
01:20:52,972 --> 01:20:53,612
Let's go out.

1284
01:21:05,479 --> 01:21:07,173
Thank you

1285
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:36,214
Hold on.
Let's go in　for a bit

1286
01:21:38,201 --> 01:21:39,527
That's bad.

1287
01:21:41,086 --> 01:21:41,973
 Why is that?

1288
01:21:42,324 --> 01:21:44,465
I mean,we're not married yet, right?

1289
01:21:44,710 --> 01:21:46,440
You forced on me the other day

1290
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,130
No, I regretted it a lot later

1291
01:21:49,092 --> 01:21:50,795
I'll confess like a man

1292
01:21:51,393 --> 01:21:53,893
Is there a reason you don't want to invite me to a hotel anymore?

1293
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:03,651
I invited you tonight just to try it out.

1294
01:22:04,371 --> 01:22:05,442
Well, Let's go

1295
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:09,123
I think I heard it all from Ishibe-kun

1296
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:11,628
I'm getting married with a woman at the end of this month

1297
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:13,612
What about our promise?

1298
01:22:13,945 --> 01:22:17,816
Hmm? Well, it's like it never happened.

1299
01:22:18,330 --> 01:22:19,970
You say that very frankly

1300
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:21,952
No,you know

1301
01:22:22,193 --> 01:22:26,629
If you love me, you'll understand, right? For my sake,

1302
01:22:27,126 --> 01:22:28,623
Don't you think about my happiness?

1303
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:34,170
the 500,000 yen I borrowed from you..

1304
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:36,310
Well, I'll give it back if that happens.

1305
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:38,270
I'll just throw that stuff away

1306
01:22:38,693 --> 01:22:39,813
Oh my god.

1307
01:22:44,118 --> 01:22:48,446
I'll pay you back the money I borrowed,
whether you throw it away or not

1308
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,544
Because if I keep borrowing money for no reason, I will be hindering my career advancement.

1309
01:22:53,137 --> 01:22:54,729
You're an egoistic monster.

1310
01:22:54,980 --> 01:22:56,350
Everyone is egoistic

1311
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:57,946
Everyone thinks they're cute

1312
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:02,410
This time, too, is a once in a lifetime opportunity for me

1313
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:04,040
I have to take that chance

1314
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:07,400
Is it your chance to marry the president's daughter
and become a senior managing director?

1315
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:08,393
Of course.

1316
01:23:09,260 --> 01:23:11,436
because as a salary man, you advance up the ladder

1317
01:23:12,150 --> 01:23:13,700
Just try acting like a normal person

1318
01:23:13,700 --> 01:23:17,460
I'll ride the train all my life and punch a time card, and that's how I'll grow old

1319
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:19,181
Isn't your father a good example?

1320
01:23:19,206 --> 01:23:20,997
He's a great man

1321
01:23:21,022 --> 01:23:22,784
Don't look down on him.

1322
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:23,752
Excuse me

1323
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,320
Anyway, I'll give you your money back

1324
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:31,507
Instead, One year installment payment please.

1325
01:23:31,705 --> 01:23:34,342
I will pay the interest rate be 10%.

1326
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,352
Well, I'll send it to you every month

1327
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:50,385
Hey

1328
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,676
Mitsuzawa?

1329
01:24:56,937 --> 01:24:57,970
It's raining.

1330
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:04,434
Let's go

1331
01:25:05,500 --> 01:25:06,797
You're going to catch a cold.

1332
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:08,048
You were just watching us?

1333
01:25:08,995 --> 01:25:09,622
Yes

1334
01:25:10,547 --> 01:25:11,954
Did I looked pretty stupid?

1335
01:25:13,038 --> 01:25:13,912
Kind of.

1336
01:25:14,753 --> 01:25:16,176
You can despise me.

1337
01:25:16,794 --> 01:25:18,354
I won't.

1338
01:25:19,870 --> 01:25:20,568
Let's go.

1339
01:25:22,736 --> 01:25:23,516
Ishibe.

1340
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,151
I know that, I know that,

1341
01:25:33,176 --> 01:25:34,564
Stop crying.

1342
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:38,531
It seems that I ended up to win.

1343
01:25:48,755 --> 01:25:52,910
Come on! Strike! Good ball!

1344
01:25:53,303 --> 01:25:53,997
When did you come?

1345
01:25:54,283 --> 01:25:55,210
Just right now.

1346
01:25:55,383 --> 01:25:56,523
He's only my son.

1347
01:25:56,710 --> 01:25:57,300
I know

1348
01:25:57,619 --> 01:25:58,468
Oh, why?

1349
01:25:58,493 --> 01:26:00,230
I just felt so.
Let me play with him.

1350
01:26:00,692 --> 01:26:02,611
Kazuo-chan, He's Tatsuta-san's uncle

1351
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:03,930
Hello.

1352
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:05,384
Hello.
Come on.

1353
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:09,111
Mitsuda-san and Mikako-san came to Kyoto for the her mother's 7th death memory.

1354
01:26:09,540 --> 01:26:11,360
See, you've known it many times

1355
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,720
I know that one day you will be the housewife here

1356
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:16,070
But I still don't know

1357
01:26:16,070 --> 01:26:18,320
Well, the system has already been decided

1358
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:20,860
So you're just staying around like this,

1359
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,453
You're a reliable young man, I'm counting on you to support me

1360
01:26:24,097 --> 01:26:26,282
Come on, I'm gonna hit it

1361
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,940
Both Fumiko and Shinako will be bringing their friends along

1362
01:26:30,940 --> 01:26:34,306
I know we're planning to have a drinking party in the evening

1363
01:26:34,592 --> 01:26:35,839
I wanna join you.

1364
01:26:36,312 --> 01:26:37,585
Come on.

1365
01:26:38,979 --> 01:26:41,294
That's not the way to swing a bat,

1366
01:26:41,467 --> 01:26:43,691
I'll hit like Nagashima.

1367
01:26:48,485 --> 01:26:50,326
Whoa.

1368
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:53,297
who's that?

1369
01:26:53,402 --> 01:26:55,124
You can't play baseball in a place like that.

1370
01:26:55,149 --> 01:26:55,611
Shit.

1371
01:26:56,985 --> 01:26:57,691
Mom.

1372
01:27:58,576 --> 01:28:01,967
Hey, our mom grave is around there.

1373
01:28:08,429 --> 01:28:10,824
The valley is Mt. Toribe

1374
01:28:12,848 --> 01:28:16,368
Dad, if you ask that person to come to our house?

1375
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:17,689
that person?

1376
01:28:20,106 --> 01:28:21,367
She's a nice person

1377
01:28:21,392 --> 01:28:23,682
I feel bad for my died wife.

1378
01:28:24,350 --> 01:28:29,080
It feels like we're close now, and I'm sure that will be a joy for your mother too

1379
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:29,928
But...

1380
01:28:30,742 --> 01:28:32,950
Dad needs to stabilize his behavior

1381
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:35,090
Everyone can't go to their wedding in peace, right?

1382
01:28:35,090 --> 01:28:37,305
If I get married, will you get married too?

1383
01:28:37,755 --> 01:28:38,808
Yes, I will

1384
01:28:40,031 --> 01:28:41,871
If I find someone nice.

1385
01:28:43,085 --> 01:28:44,538
how about Tatsuta-kun? Eh?

1386
01:28:51,518 --> 01:28:53,748
I think he is a good young man

1387
01:28:56,010 --> 01:28:57,885
I wonder if I'll be rejected again.

1388
01:28:57,909 --> 01:28:59,080
Not at all

1389
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,282
Because Tatsuta said so

1390
01:29:02,275 --> 01:29:04,325
I'll leave it to your father

1391
01:29:04,640 --> 01:29:08,470
Well then, I guess I should make a decision too.

1392
01:29:17,031 --> 01:29:19,146
You can take your time, right? Huh?

1393
01:29:19,170 --> 01:29:20,026
Well, yeah

1394
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,945
I feel sorry for an old lady like me,

1395
01:29:22,970 --> 01:29:24,545
I feel so honored

1396
01:29:25,529 --> 01:29:28,929
I think you and Miyoko are well matched.

1397
01:29:28,982 --> 01:29:30,300
Why you push me?

1398
01:29:30,394 --> 01:29:34,769
Once everyone's is married, I will naturally be married with someone.

1399
01:29:34,794 --> 01:29:36,546
Let's have a toast.

1400
01:29:37,267 --> 01:29:38,426
For our happiness.

1401
01:29:38,627 --> 01:29:39,620
Thank you.

1402
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,727
Oh? It must be Kazuo.

1403
01:29:57,947 --> 01:29:58,957
Oh, that's right.

1404
01:29:59,368 --> 01:30:00,595
Did you forget something?

1405
01:30:00,769 --> 01:30:01,142
Yeah.

1406
01:30:03,540 --> 01:30:04,114
This.

1407
01:30:22,308 --> 01:30:23,338
See you later.

1408
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:25,607
Well...

1409
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:31,413
Sorry I made you surprise.

1410
01:30:32,119 --> 01:30:33,337
I love you.

1411
01:30:44,554 --> 01:30:45,241
Thanks for waiting.

1412
01:30:45,266 --> 01:30:47,891
What do you want to eat?
western food? Japanese food?

1413
01:30:48,174 --> 01:30:49,642
I wanna eat a steak.

1414
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:50,455
Okay.

1415
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:56,381
Don't push me.

1416
01:32:58,803 --> 01:33:03,809
THE END

00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:27,222
Sensei

00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:39,460
<i>Onsen Joi / Hot Springs Lady (1964)</i>

5
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,180
Thank you very much for coming.

6
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,700
Welcome.

7
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,052
I'll show you around

8
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,457
Hey.

9
00:03:18,237 --> 00:03:20,432
Dear!

10
00:03:21,478 --> 00:03:23,138
Where is the doctor?

11
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:25,589
I think he's coming soon.

12
00:03:25,614 --> 00:03:27,752
A customer fainted.

13
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,640
I'll call him.

14
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:34,259
What's the hell?

15
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:36,303
She has high blood pressure.

16
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:39,228
hello, doctor, this is Matsunoe Ryokan

17
00:03:39,372 --> 00:03:42,271
Is there a doctor?
Thank you very much.

18
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,844
Hana-chan, come on.

19
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:46,878
what happened?

20
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,036
What happened?

21
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:50,469
Newlywed bride collapses in the bathtub.

22
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,977
So she's naked then

23
00:03:52,002 --> 00:03:53,852
She's totally naked,

24
00:03:57,891 --> 00:04:00,513
hey, where are you going?

25
00:04:01,864 --> 00:04:03,137
Sense is coming.

26
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,456
Madam, the

27
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:08,864
It's true. he's come here leisurely

28
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:13,516
Here's fine.

29
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:18,016
Where's doctor?

30
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:20,907
I'm checking out.

31
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:22,770
Come on.

32
00:04:23,315 --> 00:04:25,332
What's the hell?

33
00:04:26,407 --> 00:04:28,187
Come on

34
00:04:30,547 --> 00:04:31,988
Wake up.

35
00:04:32,887 --> 00:04:33,687
Oh no.

36
00:04:34,634 --> 00:04:35,747
Doctor.

37
00:04:36,207 --> 00:04:38,067
This way.

38
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:43,450
Water.

39
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,566
Thank you so much, doctor

40
00:04:45,884 --> 00:04:47,644
Doctor is here.

41
00:04:47,911 --> 00:04:49,299
Pleases see her.

42
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,617
Have a water.

43
00:04:51,984 --> 00:04:54,024
You are still drinking water.

44
00:04:55,706 --> 00:04:57,132
Let me see.

45
00:04:57,363 --> 00:04:58,044
what are you doing?

46
00:04:58,069 --> 00:04:59,360
Stay away.

47
00:04:59,559 --> 00:05:00,241
It's cold when she's naked

48
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,411
Stay away.

49
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,268
Pleases see her.

50
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:04,748
Hurry up.

51
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:06,520
please hurry up

52
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,520
doctor is here.

53
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,245
Don't worry

54
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,199
Don't stay in bath too long.

55
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,656
It's no big deal.

56
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:15,521
She's the patient.

57
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:16,865
Oh her.

58
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:18,738
Calm down

59
00:05:22,165 --> 00:05:23,425
Don't look at it.

60
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,651
Hey you.

61
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:27,924
Stay strong.

62
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,130
what's wrong with you?

63
00:05:31,307 --> 00:05:32,407
Secchan

64
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,198
Give me another water.

65
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:37,950
I need to see a doctor too.

66
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:39,674
Hurry up.

67
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:47,537
These pills are 3 years old.
I wonder it works.

68
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,720
Medicine for high blood pressure is nothing more than a placebo

69
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:57,914
But you can't take urgent doctor's visit anymore.

70
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,872
I'm too old.

71
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,935
Telling me to work any more is the same as telling me to die

72
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,940
Don't say that.
We need you.

73
00:06:07,965 --> 00:06:09,856
There's no doctor else in this town

74
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:11,730
It's none of my business.

75
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:18,120
Even though it's a hot spring town, there isn't a single doctor here even though there are 70 or 80 people employed here

76
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,802
If you suddenly died at any moment, the local hospital would be in trouble, so it would be a disaster

77
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:26,550
It might be happening.

78
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:28,356
Bring dishes for no.8 table.

79
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:32,060
What about the story we talked about before?

80
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,378
so I asked a friend in Tokyo

81
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,706
I received a postcard from this friend saying he found a substitute and will be coming over in a couple of days

82
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,010
Well, he's not coming

83
00:06:44,207 --> 00:06:45,751
Here's too boring.

84
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,238
Because he hates me.

85
00:06:47,597 --> 00:06:49,019
What are you talking about?

86
00:06:49,618 --> 00:06:53,530
Doctor get paid, so someone will come.

87
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,495
Doctor

88
00:06:56,085 --> 00:06:57,735
Is there a more effective medicine?

89
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,566
Well, why don't you quit smoking?

90
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,115
No I mean..

91
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:04,765
There's no medicine for that

92
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,482
Your wife is too young.

93
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,864
If you push yourself too hard, you'll end up falling over

94
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,319
There's still a lot of life ahead of me.

95
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,960
Customer number six would like to receive an injection

96
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,470
Another mahjong customer?

97
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,078
Yes, he's been up all night since yesterday and he's lacking vitamins,

98
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:25,051
Say him if he sleeps, he'll get better right away,

99
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,617
so don't say that, just go and see him

100
00:07:28,452 --> 00:07:30,158
Hey you know who I am?

101
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,250
but at times like this

102
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,841
If only your son Masaki would be here.

103
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,790
He's not to be trusted

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,373
He was born as the only son of a doctor, but he hates doctors

105
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:44,218
doctor, if you keep fighting around forever

106
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,931
You have to made up

107
00:07:47,115 --> 00:07:48,402
We are no longer fighting

108
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,523
He loves bees

109
00:07:50,809 --> 00:07:52,949
He let home and keep them.

110
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,977
But even though he went to medical school,

111
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,520
he was only able to live with bees

112
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,021
I guess he's better than people here

113
00:08:04,413 --> 00:08:06,783
Are you home, doctor?

114
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,033
Whenever I'm here, I stay long.

115
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:12,686
Sorry I didn't take care of you.

116
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:18,000
So, Mrs., your husband...

117
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,450
He’s getting older, so please take care of him from now on

118
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,046
customers from union has not come yet?

119
00:08:27,212 --> 00:08:29,416
They hasn't come yet.

120
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:31,446
Something might be happened about bus

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,267
Oh my god.

122
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,271
We need more hands.

123
00:08:47,935 --> 00:08:49,895
Push the bus.

124
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:53,419
Let's push it together.

125
00:08:54,065 --> 00:08:55,940
I'll try it again.

126
00:08:56,359 --> 00:08:57,710
Please cooperate

127
00:09:11,435 --> 00:09:13,782
Damn it.
It's close.

128
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:16,889
Sorry

129
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,180
I would like to ask everyone

130
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,929
Please help us.

131
00:09:26,058 --> 00:09:27,478
Please.

132
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:37,217
I would like to ask all customers to please go outside and help out

133
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,978
It can't be helped.
Let's go.

134
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,772
Well, I guess we'll push this bus and make a leisurely lunch later

135
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:48,433
Hey wake up.

136
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,637
This person was leaning on me

137
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,996
What?
We haven't arrived yet?

138
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,740
Bus got troubled.

139
00:10:05,912 --> 00:10:07,699
I see. I'll go out.

140
00:10:30,257 --> 00:10:31,940
Oh, I see. sorry

141
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,243
Thank you very much.

142
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:45,745
Please get on the bus

143
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,500
thank you

144
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,883
Everyone wait, the
condition of the engine is bad.

145
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,030
This happens once in 3 days these days

146
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,220
After all, it's a luxury car for transfers

147
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,911
It's just a showy car.

148
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:59,044
Our company won't buy it

149
00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:06,980
What's wrong?

150
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,702
What's wrong with your face?

151
00:11:17,225 --> 00:11:18,905
Clean your face.

152
00:11:26,047 --> 00:11:27,589
you're actually quite kind.

153
00:11:27,676 --> 00:11:29,355
I just can't bear to watch you

154
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,747
Are you alone?

155
00:11:33,255 --> 00:11:34,852
The car isn't moving yet.

156
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:35,975
Sorry

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,930
Please wait a little longer

158
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,130
It seems like you're in a hurry

159
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:40,830
Will I walk?

160
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:42,020
There must be hot springs.

161
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,549
Why don't you take your time?

162
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,176
Please have some.

163
00:11:49,285 --> 00:11:51,152
Don't be hesitate.

164
00:11:52,737 --> 00:11:54,217
Please have some.

165
00:11:54,252 --> 00:11:55,475
Thank you very much.

166
00:11:56,772 --> 00:11:59,020
Well, I guess I had one too

167
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:24,983
Excuse me.

168
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,048
The doctor is here?

169
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
Yes he's here.

170
00:12:31,225 --> 00:12:33,644
but it's your first visit?

171
00:12:33,724 --> 00:12:37,534
I got pregnant.

172
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,705
Take it.

173
00:12:41,242 --> 00:12:42,742
Take care.

174
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:45,047
I got pregnant.

175
00:12:45,412 --> 00:12:47,492
Do you wanna see a doctor?

176
00:12:47,711 --> 00:12:50,082
Before that, I have something to discuss with Doctor.

177
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,100
Please,

178
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,026
it looks like a patient is here

179
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,290
Don't pretend you can't hear.

180
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,530
Doctor,please.

181
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,013
She's first visiting.

182
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,717
Hold her wait.

183
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:39,120
Doctor, it seems like you have another patient

184
00:13:39,489 --> 00:13:40,935
Hold on

185
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:42,588
Doctor?

186
00:13:42,628 --> 00:13:43,688
What's wrong?

187
00:13:43,834 --> 00:13:46,830
the visit doctor has just arrived

188
00:13:46,855 --> 00:13:47,551
Really?

189
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:50,405
Apparently, He left Tokyo in this morning.

190
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:52,483
He must be tried.

191
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:55,812
doctor, hurry up, doctor,

192
00:13:55,972 --> 00:13:57,702
that's good

193
00:14:03,235 --> 00:14:06,401
Please be polite.

194
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:08,653
He's not a customer, so this is fine

195
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:10,295
That's true, but this is not good.

196
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,665
I don't have to change.

197
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,254
Make sure you wear a jacket.

198
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,661
He left Tokyo in this morning.

199
00:14:18,346 --> 00:14:23,313
So now They found a doctor soon.

200
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,166
I thought no one might come.

201
00:14:25,466 --> 00:14:27,155
What kind of doctor was he?

202
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,880
I can't say anything extravagant

203
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,506
I'm sure the doctor is an elderly man who doesn't mind a country bumpkin doctor.

204
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,020
Sorry for keeping wait

205
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,460
I'm Isao shiozuki

206
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,825
Nice to meet you,

207
00:14:57,137 --> 00:15:01,254
Are you the substance doctor?

208
00:15:03,204 --> 00:15:05,971
Please use it.

209
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,755
it's nostalgic and Shota has bad writing.

210
00:15:11,765 --> 00:15:14,735
Long time no see.

211
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:21,829
Let me introduce Shiotsuki Isao right away.
As you can see, she is a beautiful doctor

212
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,610
doctor

213
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:30,350
As you can see, she is a beautiful woman, and if I had to mention one flaw,

214
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,020
She hates men.

215
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,947
That's not much.

216
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:39,625
Please ask her academic history and career history

217
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,156
Nice to meet you.

218
00:15:41,345 --> 00:15:42,172
Same here.

219
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:44,988
Well, what are you doing, doctor? Anyway,

220
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:46,899
please come in.

221
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,670
Umm,  Omura and Kosaka

222
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:49,440
Bring her luggage.

223
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:52,790
I thought old doctor would come.

224
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,083
I'm just a beginner,

225
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:57,035
I'm glad you came here.

226
00:15:57,205 --> 00:15:59,615
Please finish your chat and make some tea

227
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,960
please come in.

228
00:16:02,369 --> 00:16:03,456
Make some tea.

229
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:04,102
I know.

230
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,167
Hurry up.

231
00:16:08,587 --> 00:16:10,438
What about me?

232
00:16:10,756 --> 00:16:12,213
Are you a patient?

233
00:16:12,238 --> 00:16:14,606
You made me wait

234
00:16:14,913 --> 00:16:17,141
Anyway, let's have a look

235
00:16:17,317 --> 00:16:18,277
Please.

236
00:16:23,454 --> 00:16:27,536
even though it's a welcome party, this
is the only thing we can do around here,

237
00:16:28,036 --> 00:16:29,964
the vegetables are very fresh

238
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:32,933
Our doctor makes everything by hand

239
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,584
I'm more farmer than doctor.

240
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,470
Please have a drink.

241
00:16:40,096 --> 00:16:42,933
She can't drink.

242
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:44,302
Just little.

243
00:16:44,468 --> 00:16:46,282
He wants to drink.

244
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,130
What's the hell?

245
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,420
Don't drink anymore.

246
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,888
You've already had 3 bottles.

247
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:52,881
four bottle.

248
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:55,087
You've drunk four bottles.

249
00:16:55,112 --> 00:16:58,008
Should I take your blood pressure?

250
00:16:58,542 --> 00:16:59,735
You're drunk.

251
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:05,297
It's okay

252
00:17:06,305 --> 00:17:14,207
Actually I think There's no good substance doctor.

253
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:15,706
Don't say that.

254
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:18,758
Old doctor or female doctor

255
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:21,316
or someone else.

256
00:17:21,515 --> 00:17:23,890
so which one am I?

257
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,840
doctor, let's take a little rest here

258
00:17:29,871 --> 00:17:31,727
I want another one.

259
00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:35,200
you'll get scolded by your wife.

260
00:17:35,225 --> 00:17:36,415
Where's his wife?

261
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,352
His wife passed away more than ten years ago

262
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:43,635
She worries about his drinking until the day she died

263
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,264
She told me to take care of him.

264
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,672
Don't say bullshit.

265
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,280
Osaka-san, no, no, it's fine

266
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:53,715
Serve me.

267
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:55,290
If that's the case, then leave it.

268
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,624
Aren't you my friend?

269
00:18:05,676 --> 00:18:07,389
Stay strong.

270
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,123
Please have some.

271
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,974
Well then, I can not drink.

272
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:13,934
Me?
Thanks.

273
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,287
When it comes to alcohol, She can't resist it

274
00:18:16,312 --> 00:18:18,334
You know about me so much.

275
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,495
please take care of us

276
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:23,821
I am working here on and off.

277
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:24,988
Who?

278
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:26,321
Shut up!

279
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:35,511
I wondered who it was, maybe it was a thief, but it was you

280
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,440
Masahiko?

281
00:18:37,861 --> 00:18:39,560
It's gotten pretty cold

282
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:40,826
so I came to get some clothes,

283
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,493
I told you no to come home

284
00:18:43,716 --> 00:18:45,590
Don't say that.

285
00:18:46,502 --> 00:18:48,222
I don't wanna see him

286
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,280
I thought I would be thin again, but I wanted to see my father's face

287
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:57,797
Oh?

288
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,894
He's my son,Masahiko.

289
00:19:25,246 --> 00:19:26,975
My face is really funny?

290
00:19:27,301 --> 00:19:28,610
I'm not saying it's weird

291
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,634
As for the level?

292
00:19:29,747 --> 00:19:33,986
It's kind of funny.

293
00:19:34,153 --> 00:19:34,920
What score?

294
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:35,993
40

295
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:38,732
Okay then your face is 20 points

296
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:44,228
Did you sell my honey?

297
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:47,796
It's no good, we can't sell it at all

298
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:50,097
If it's easy to buy as a souvenir.

299
00:19:50,221 --> 00:19:51,613
What are you talking about?

300
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,421
This is good as a souvenir

301
00:19:53,963 --> 00:19:58,455
Yokan and Manju are too common as souvenir

302
00:19:58,555 --> 00:20:00,060
No matter how you say

303
00:20:00,085 --> 00:20:01,378
We can't sell it.

304
00:20:01,493 --> 00:20:03,417
OK, have a drink.

305
00:20:04,348 --> 00:20:04,882
Treat me?

306
00:20:05,042 --> 00:20:05,862
No way

307
00:20:07,692 --> 00:20:10,290
Well, I'm busy for a bit now, so take a bath before that

308
00:20:10,479 --> 00:20:11,135
I took bath.

309
00:20:11,421 --> 00:20:11,805
When?

310
00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:12,787
last month

311
00:20:13,421 --> 00:20:14,568
You're crazy

312
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:18,580
Let's have fun.
Your friend has visit you.

313
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:20,560
What a friend

314
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,114
Hey you

315
00:20:23,528 --> 00:20:25,449
We'll have drink.
Why don't you join us?

316
00:20:26,028 --> 00:20:26,852
Really?

317
00:20:26,877 --> 00:20:28,927
You guys should go upstairs

318
00:20:30,213 --> 00:20:31,260
I think one person is fine.

319
00:20:31,673 --> 00:20:32,567
It can't be helped.

320
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:35,270
Hey you please stay here.

321
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,501
Thanks.

322
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,469
You're awesome.

323
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:41,895
Thanks.

324
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:43,836
What's your name?

325
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:47,098
Don't ask my name.

326
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,573
Why?

327
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:52,904
She’s cool.

328
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,462
Hime-chan, that's rude

329
00:20:54,702 --> 00:20:56,341
She's Yabuuchi's substance doctor.

330
00:20:58,096 --> 00:20:59,903
Hello?

331
00:21:00,998 --> 00:21:03,685
Nice to meet you.

332
00:21:04,483 --> 00:21:06,188
When we met on the bus,

333
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:09,013
I never expected that you would be visiting us.

334
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,185
I didn't expect too.

335
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:13,257
I'm Yabuuchi's son.

336
00:21:13,303 --> 00:21:14,763
Sister.

337
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:16,777
Where's patient's room?

338
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,772
It's over there.

339
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,860
Actually, I wanna ask you about the patient.

340
00:21:22,421 --> 00:21:24,314
I'll talk to you after

341
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,562
I'm sorry

342
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,503
Doctor is here?

343
00:21:37,703 --> 00:21:39,050
I'm sorry

344
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,573
I wonder what happened

345
00:21:42,876 --> 00:21:44,396
Thanks for your hard work.

346
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,824
If you had come a little earlier...

347
00:21:48,117 --> 00:21:49,475
She would have died?

348
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:50,742
No.

349
00:21:51,076 --> 00:21:53,705
Up until now, she's been sitting on my lap

350
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,330
Now she is finally sleeping soundly

351
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,800
Anyway, let's have a look

352
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,600
Is she here?

353
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,507
She's troublesome.

354
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:05,990
Is she your daughter?

355
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:12,075
Oh you are awake?

356
00:22:14,368 --> 00:22:17,196
Well, Lili-chan, she'll see you

357
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,762
She's the patient?

358
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:21,981
Yes

359
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:25,745
She can't poo these days

360
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:26,455
So,

361
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,975
I thinking that maybe if I put her in this hot spring,

362
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,260
she would improve a little,

363
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,920
but that was a big mistake

364
00:22:31,946 --> 00:22:33,985
If that's the case,ask veterinarian.

365
00:22:34,738 --> 00:22:37,229
I don't care if you see her.

366
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,159
That would be a problem for me

367
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,156
Hey, are you going back?

368
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,022
But I'm not veterinarian

369
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:45,234
But listen to me.

370
00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:46,792
What's the hell?

371
00:22:46,979 --> 00:22:50,152
I don't care if you see her.

372
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:52,459
so I wonder how many times I have to tell you.
But I'm not veterinarian

373
00:22:52,652 --> 00:22:53,573
Does that mean

374
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,700
You let my daughter die?

375
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,140
No, that is different matter.

376
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,420
What's different?

377
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:03,752
I'm going to kill this dog?

378
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:11,986
What's the hell about her.

379
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,107
This is the first time I've ever been insulted like this.

380
00:23:15,718 --> 00:23:18,801
I wish you had made it clear from the beginning that it was the other person's dog

381
00:23:19,827 --> 00:23:21,510
Sorry, that's what we thought

382
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:24,280
Well, please, she is our regular customer.

383
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,508
Why don't you leave common sense?

384
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:26,942
Don't get mad.

385
00:23:27,254 --> 00:23:27,741
No

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,410
I don't think it's a big deal.
even if it's just over a dog

387
00:23:30,435 --> 00:23:31,957
It's a huge insult.

388
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,120
I wonder what doctors is.

389
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,120
I don't think you need to think so seriously

390
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,740
I don't want to do it at all

391
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,074
Doctor.

392
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:43,280
She's leaving.

393
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,360
what should we do?

394
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:47,379
Oh my god. Hey you, go away

395
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:49,006
Me?

396
00:24:02,095 --> 00:24:03,148
Okamura.

397
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:21,140
it seems you're in a lot of pain.

398
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:23,048
That's right.

399
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,963
Whatever happened, Painful rashes on buttocks

400
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,727
There is also a slight fever

401
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:36,589
Are you a doctor?

402
00:24:38,354 --> 00:24:43,409
Genkichi Okamura, 50 years old, fishmonger. you drink alcohol

403
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,057
Okay, let's take a look

404
00:24:53,259 --> 00:24:55,897
Where to take a look?

405
00:24:56,024 --> 00:24:57,237
Painful rashes?

406
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:00,467
But that's the place isn't good.

407
00:25:00,492 --> 00:25:02,436
Don't worry.

408
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,086
well...I'm embarrassed.

409
00:25:06,257 --> 00:25:07,824
Let me see.

410
00:25:12,134 --> 00:25:13,966
this is a common tumor

411
00:25:14,701 --> 00:25:16,161
I'm embarrassed.

412
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:20,022
I can take care of this.

413
00:25:20,545 --> 00:25:22,485
Omura-san, help me

414
00:25:23,492 --> 00:25:24,992
You'll cut it off?

415
00:25:25,498 --> 00:25:28,059
There's no scalpel.

416
00:25:28,084 --> 00:25:29,243
I think there are some.

417
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:32,193
But this is damaged.

418
00:25:32,394 --> 00:25:33,427
Oh yeah.

419
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:34,683
This is all we have.

420
00:25:34,989 --> 00:25:36,382
it's fine even if it's just a little cut.

421
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:41,997
please wait over there for a bit and we'll sterilize it right away

422
00:25:50,706 --> 00:25:52,539
He is here?

423
00:25:53,471 --> 00:25:54,297
Who?

424
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:55,731
Doctor.

425
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:59,344
Injection, injection, it's the usual one

426
00:25:59,825 --> 00:26:01,941
Anyway, please showed me

427
00:26:03,323 --> 00:26:06,691
Tell him about that.

428
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,945
Oh boss, why are you showing your butt?

429
00:26:11,694 --> 00:26:13,180
She's a doctor.

430
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:16,666
I thought she was a nurse.

431
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,869
That's true, she's being cool.

432
00:26:21,021 --> 00:26:23,241
It's just a little prick.

433
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:26,265
You cut up the fish.

434
00:26:31,996 --> 00:26:33,627
Ok done.

435
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:40,794
Oh, you don't have to be so arrogant

436
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,865
Because I'm always like that.

437
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,801
Oh, I see. Mimi-san from the nude studio

438
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:50,467
Don't drink a lot.

439
00:26:51,331 --> 00:26:52,966
I don't drink that much

440
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:55,749
Wait.

441
00:26:56,161 --> 00:26:57,659
What's the hell?

442
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,044
No

443
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,037
But you are lucky.

444
00:27:15,231 --> 00:27:15,944
For what?

445
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:18,414
You found good substance doctor.

446
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:23,775
Is it because of that substitute doctor that we can play Go like this

447
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,716
And she's pretty beautiful too

448
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,048
She's never had this?

449
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:32,430
Don't worry about that.

450
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:40,306
If I was younger, I would seduce her.

451
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:41,517
Welcome home.

452
00:27:42,281 --> 00:27:43,194
Was it cold?

453
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:47,117
What are you talking about?
You would seduce her?

454
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:55,205
Yeah, there's no other option than this

455
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,774
Please reconsider.

456
00:28:03,832 --> 00:28:04,840
If I was going to reconsider,

457
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,810
I wouldn't bother coming

458
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,257
But it's three-month-old baby.
Thinking about the abortion.

459
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:14,150
I don't want baby.
I'm realistic.

460
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:17,365
If I give birth to a child , I will be no longer Geisha.

461
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,959
But that's a different matter.

462
00:28:19,343 --> 00:28:21,050
I won't ask you again

463
00:28:22,107 --> 00:28:23,214
What do you mean?

464
00:28:23,415 --> 00:28:24,960
I don't need to rely on doctors anymore.

465
00:28:25,354 --> 00:28:26,367
Decided that

466
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,383
There are more doctors than just here

467
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:33,529
Mamefuku.

468
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:38,943
God gave you this baby

469
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,861
So before that, think about it once more

470
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,114
I have nothing to do with God.

471
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,002
I became a hot spring geisha

472
00:28:50,715 --> 00:28:52,669
My body is all I need

473
00:29:27,451 --> 00:29:29,591
Hello?
This is Yabuuchi clinic.

474
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,778
Your doctor collapsed

475
00:29:32,352 --> 00:29:33,513
Our doctor collapsed?

476
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,377
Is it true that our doctor collapsed?

477
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:39,026
What's wrong?

478
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,386
Our doctor collapsed.

479
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,870
Is he dying?

480
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:03,020
It's not a big deal

481
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,662
Does he have blood pressure?

482
00:30:05,002 --> 00:30:06,627
Acute alcohol toxicity

483
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,920
That means he drank too much

484
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,918
That's why I said.

485
00:30:10,948 --> 00:30:12,326
I know I'll get scolded

486
00:30:26,206 --> 00:30:28,218
Hey, hey, that was the doctor we talked about

487
00:30:28,372 --> 00:30:29,785
Oh she.

488
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,898
I see,

489
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:34,398
Why you are impressed?

490
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,460
My boss is into her lately and he always talk about her.

491
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,431
Hello?

492
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:03,805
What's wrong?

493
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:08,134
She's Kichiya.
Nice to meet you.

494
00:31:08,334 --> 00:31:09,514
Nice to meet you.

495
00:31:09,872 --> 00:31:10,739
Nice to meet you.

496
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,470
Oh Kichiya.

497
00:31:13,365 --> 00:31:14,845
You're so cute

498
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,138
She's doctor.

499
00:31:17,302 --> 00:31:18,606
Nice to meet you.

500
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:20,622
Let's go

501
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,410
Doctor.

502
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:29,129
Don't talk about it

503
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:33,650
Oh, but don't push yourself

504
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,598
I understand.

505
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,200
Is it ok to wake up?
The doctor told you to sleep.

506
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:49,067
Omura has taken over this month's accounting

507
00:31:49,396 --> 00:31:50,981
How was the Results?

508
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,638
Sales have doubled

509
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:56,215
The income has almost doubled.

510
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,333
But you know, that's not too big deal.

511
00:31:59,786 --> 00:32:00,614
Why?

512
00:32:01,778 --> 00:32:03,668
It's because of how bad are you.

513
00:32:04,012 --> 00:32:07,168
Shiotsuki is how skilled she is

514
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,559
I see, that may be the case

515
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:15,050
doctor, why don't you make her your wife?

516
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:19,083
I think you make a good couple.

517
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:22,254
It would be silly

518
00:32:22,668 --> 00:32:24,637
if I married someone young like her,

519
00:32:24,872 --> 00:32:28,512
The public would laugh at me.

520
00:32:28,537 --> 00:32:29,569
Don't get me wrong.

521
00:32:29,944 --> 00:32:31,178
I mean,

522
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,631
What do you think about Masahiko's wife?

523
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,412
Oh for Masahiko

524
00:32:36,638 --> 00:32:39,896
It's about time for Masahiko to get married.

525
00:32:40,513 --> 00:32:41,581
Grandma

526
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,470
Masahiko has nothing to do with us.

527
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,162
I remember it well,

528
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,263
so don't say things like that in front of me.

529
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:52,451
I'm annoyed,

530
00:32:52,476 --> 00:32:55,502
He's better than you.

531
00:32:55,731 --> 00:32:59,763
What?
I am a decent person.

532
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:02,935
He's totally idiot.

533
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,990
Why she makes Red rice?

534
00:33:09,897 --> 00:33:11,256
We don't have time.

535
00:33:11,381 --> 00:33:12,655
Do I need to put this in?

536
00:33:35,356 --> 00:33:35,814
Oh,

537
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,928
Who is it?

538
00:33:57,356 --> 00:33:59,310
Today is your son's birthday

539
00:33:59,842 --> 00:34:02,920
He's not here.

540
00:34:03,785 --> 00:34:06,295
Why you cook red rice for?

541
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,299
hurry up.

542
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:15,186
Are you alright?

543
00:34:15,975 --> 00:34:18,819
Don't eat too much at once

544
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:21,296
By the way

545
00:34:24,093 --> 00:34:24,632
Oh baby?

546
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:27,233
I wonder if that many folding boxes

547
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:30,944
Make some rice balls, Bring some water.

548
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,951
What are you doing?

549
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,319
Don't do anything like that.

550
00:34:40,687 --> 00:34:42,640
I don't do that

551
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,202
Your blood pressure is rising again

552
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,023
he's coming.

553
00:34:53,531 --> 00:34:57,171
What do you have?

554
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:01,577
I'll give everyone one onigiri

555
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:02,882
It's delicious.

556
00:35:03,078 --> 00:35:04,828
Give me.

557
00:35:05,749 --> 00:35:07,070
It's delicious?

558
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,406
It's delicious.

559
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,787
I know.

560
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,593
it's definitely tasty.

561
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:17,618
Don't fight.
Enjoy eating.

562
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:23,430
Get along.
Oh she's coming!

563
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:56,230
It's 5 days, playing Mahjong.

564
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,890
So, what should I do?

565
00:35:57,998 --> 00:35:59,433
Here it is.

566
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,910
Sorry, please. Thank you

567
00:36:04,902 --> 00:36:08,191
Excuse me.
The doctor is here.

568
00:36:09,887 --> 00:36:11,363
Oh.

569
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:20,345
Who is patient?

570
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,933
What's wrong?

571
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:29,980
I switched it off

572
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,785
Are you here to bother us?

573
00:36:31,879 --> 00:36:33,551
I'm not here to watch mahjong.

574
00:36:33,640 --> 00:36:35,074
Because you won't stop.

575
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:38,316
She's cool.

576
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:39,831
Let's keep playing.

577
00:36:39,856 --> 00:36:41,066
wait a second.

578
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:45,030
Why did you guys call me?

579
00:36:45,055 --> 00:36:49,200
we need a doctor when we are collapse.

580
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:52,535
Why do you want to play mahjong so badly?

581
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,769
We're playing for Naomi.

582
00:36:54,848 --> 00:36:55,402
Naomi?

583
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,019
It's me

584
00:36:58,432 --> 00:37:00,838
They'll propose to me at the same time

585
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,830
I can't help it.

586
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,722
Whoever win, get me.

587
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:07,902
You get it?

588
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,650
Maybe if Naomi wins,

589
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,480
the three of us will buy her a car

590
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:15,870
Where's the money for a car?

591
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:18,033
There's no money.

592
00:37:18,058 --> 00:37:20,074
Do you do thief?

593
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:22,810
I'll blackmailed my mother.

594
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,495
I cheated my dad out

595
00:37:24,753 --> 00:37:26,960
You make your parents pay for it anyway

596
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,394
In short, yes.

597
00:37:28,607 --> 00:37:29,870
We all depend on our parents.

598
00:37:30,055 --> 00:37:35,160
If parents don't give us money, then they have no value

599
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,917
They Always angry

600
00:37:37,136 --> 00:37:38,670
They don't know the reality

601
00:37:38,695 --> 00:37:40,880
It's usually empty here

602
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,850
Were you not born from such parents?

603
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,574
No one wants them to give birth

604
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,316
stop with that old rant.

605
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:48,074
What?

606
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:51,542
You live an unhealthy lifestyle

607
00:37:51,567 --> 00:37:52,910
We are young.

608
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:55,100
Everyone has had a youthful time

609
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,830
Your parents too

610
00:37:57,830 --> 00:38:01,324
Youth is not a privilege

611
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,730
You ended up getting drunk.

612
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,230
Come, put out your arms

613
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:09,900
I'll get you an injection to win Mahjong

614
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:12,636
So everyone, wake up, wake up,

615
00:38:12,926 --> 00:38:14,644
The rice balls are ready?

616
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:17,128
They are sleeping now.

617
00:38:17,153 --> 00:38:21,605
I gave them a sedative injection.

618
00:38:21,875 --> 00:38:25,285
And if they have any complaints later, please let me know

619
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,035
I apologize for the inconvenience

620
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:31,870
This is our business so It's hard to decline.

621
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:33,098
Chiyo

622
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,323
Please come over for a moment. Mamefuku is in trouble.

623
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,671
She drinks a lot

624
00:38:39,988 --> 00:38:43,860
You act like a real husband when you are in a good mood

625
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:46,911
Are you pretending you don't know now

626
00:38:46,936 --> 00:38:49,316
Don't get me wrong.

627
00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:52,050
I know, I know

628
00:38:53,385 --> 00:38:54,613
I am a bit busy right now

629
00:38:54,638 --> 00:38:57,660
so what do you know?

630
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,214
Although now I am a hot spring geisha

631
00:39:02,745 --> 00:39:04,527
I used to work in Shinbashi a long time ago

632
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:05,996
I know, I know

633
00:39:06,343 --> 00:39:08,403
I'll discuss that later

634
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:12,065
Yeah, you crazy idiot

635
00:39:12,246 --> 00:39:13,575
What's the hell?

636
00:39:16,558 --> 00:39:18,558
You bastard!

637
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,527
I'm a bit busy.

638
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,839
What happened?

639
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:30,800
I'm frustrated.

640
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:36,323
What happened?

641
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,105
Here's your water.

642
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:46,917
The person was mamefuku's husband?

643
00:39:46,942 --> 00:39:48,316
He's mean.

644
00:39:48,714 --> 00:39:49,820
I'm sorry about that

645
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,180
He's a salesman for Belial cosmetics

646
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:56,110
You need to be careful too

647
00:39:56,110 --> 00:40:00,700
Why did you become Geisha? I'm sorry to ask you.

648
00:40:00,725 --> 00:40:04,895
doctor, I actually wanted to be a nurse,

649
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:06,508
Oh really?

650
00:40:06,848 --> 00:40:09,246
but We were poor

651
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,520
I didn't get into nursing school.

652
00:40:11,984 --> 00:40:13,817
Sorry to ask you.

653
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:15,501
It's okay.

654
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,620
But I plan to save up a lot of money and go to school someday

655
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,167
Until then, I'll do my best.

656
00:40:23,434 --> 00:40:24,930
I guess you are nice.

657
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:26,909
You think so?

658
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:35,022
This is the best place,

659
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:37,494
I haven't cleaned this place yet.

660
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:38,932
Is that so?

661
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,478
show me the photo?

662
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:51,018
No

663
00:40:51,051 --> 00:40:52,761
Show me.

664
00:40:53,545 --> 00:40:55,339
Oh, it's only kimono person.

665
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:56,566
Yeah

666
00:40:56,591 --> 00:40:56,865
Your girlfriend?

667
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:59,124
She may become like that in the future.

668
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:02,109
It's a long-term story

669
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:04,726
My girl, Kichiya.

670
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:06,110
Stay strong.

671
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,690
I love you

672
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:11,132
I can't stand to hear your story.

673
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,569
Wait a minute

674
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:19,890
Actually, what can I ask you? I want to tell her how I feel

675
00:41:20,389 --> 00:41:21,518
Is there any way to do that?

676
00:41:21,734 --> 00:41:23,359
You're going to do it yourself

677
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,624
If I could do that, I wouldn't call you.

678
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:31,093
I'm your best friend

679
00:41:31,351 --> 00:41:33,797
Let me see...

680
00:41:34,789 --> 00:41:36,023
Let's have drink before that.

681
00:41:36,219 --> 00:41:38,430
You're looking at my feet

682
00:41:44,008 --> 00:41:46,562
Here's crowed.

683
00:41:55,502 --> 00:42:00,046
What illness are you suffering from here?

684
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:02,382
My eyes is messed up.

685
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,344
stupid, She is not an ophthalmologist.

686
00:42:08,365 --> 00:42:13,225
Don't drink alcohol. About an injection,

687
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,520
but it doesn't work that often

688
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:19,242
I can't make money just by being naked

689
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,344
Thanks.

690
00:42:22,568 --> 00:42:25,765
I caught a fish, so I thought I'd give them some to eat

691
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:27,062
Thanks.

692
00:42:27,095 --> 00:42:28,304
Just something small.

693
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:30,632
Are you sick?

694
00:42:31,788 --> 00:42:34,093
My eyes is messed up.

695
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:39,507
Are you here?

696
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:41,874
Who? Taihei?

697
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,148
Taihei?

698
00:42:52,555 --> 00:42:54,648
Your illness is still not cured?

699
00:42:54,673 --> 00:42:58,242
So I am here.

700
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,609
Let's have some.

701
00:43:03,469 --> 00:43:05,258
What's this?

702
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:11,382
This is honey

703
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:13,890
This is good for your health.

704
00:43:13,915 --> 00:43:14,812
Let's have some.

705
00:43:15,046 --> 00:43:16,050
No way

706
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:19,360
I'm not a child, so I can't even lick honey

707
00:43:19,385 --> 00:43:20,305
Try it

708
00:43:23,554 --> 00:43:27,273
Well,This looks good.

709
00:43:27,815 --> 00:43:29,675
Drink it

710
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,632
You're very thoughtful

711
00:43:34,062 --> 00:43:36,492
but are you ok?

712
00:43:36,787 --> 00:43:38,845
I'm doctor too.

713
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,062
I know that very well

714
00:43:40,141 --> 00:43:41,976
What are you talking about?

715
00:43:42,734 --> 00:43:47,031
I received such a wonderful fish from Mr. Ume

716
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:50,695
This is a fine fish, so make some sashimi right away

717
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,460
Honey and sashimi is strange

718
00:43:54,211 --> 00:43:55,266
Did you know?

719
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,187
My ears are fine

720
00:44:00,586 --> 00:44:01,531
Damn it.

721
00:44:02,328 --> 00:44:03,617
I wanna see him.

722
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:04,988
Where are you guys from?

723
00:44:05,013 --> 00:44:07,923
I'm in trouble with him

724
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:10,415
What's wrong?

725
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:14,157
Shut up!

726
00:44:14,228 --> 00:44:16,376
She's busy.

727
00:44:17,032 --> 00:44:19,985
What are you guys all fussing about?

728
00:44:20,205 --> 00:44:23,055
Hey, What are you going to do with us?

729
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,040
I guess we're carrying too much

730
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:28,298
what I did to you guys?

731
00:44:29,645 --> 00:44:31,905
You've been up all night for 5 days

732
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:33,517
So I gave you guys a sedative.

733
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,970
That was bad

734
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,240
But if you hadn't it,

735
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,060
you would have gotten really sick

736
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,954
We had been sleeping for 3 days.

737
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:40,798
It's none of our business.

738
00:44:40,906 --> 00:44:42,325
So, it seems like your fatigue has been relieved

739
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:43,800
Everyone looks good, don't they?

740
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,520
That's the problem, we don't have the budget,

741
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,450
we can't pay it

742
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:50,392
This is all your fault, I swear

743
00:44:50,743 --> 00:44:54,832
You have to take responsibility

744
00:44:54,978 --> 00:44:56,726
I have to charge you guys.

745
00:44:56,751 --> 00:44:57,244
What?

746
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,994
You haven't paid me for the consultation.

747
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,376
How can you pay for me?

748
00:45:02,486 --> 00:45:03,900
Please pay.

749
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,578
I'm busy.

750
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:09,579
Damn it.

751
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:13,969
so I'll pay for the young people's fee.

752
00:45:14,313 --> 00:45:17,213
I was definitely the one who gave the injection

753
00:45:17,485 --> 00:45:19,344
Here you go

754
00:45:22,015 --> 00:45:23,867
I think that we can't get it from you.

755
00:45:23,891 --> 00:45:26,928
Everything is over.

756
00:45:26,953 --> 00:45:29,700
But that's not enough for me, so please

757
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,700
I see. Then how about we do it like this?

758
00:45:33,967 --> 00:45:38,255
You take our bath, and have a meal.

759
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,313
So We'll take this.

760
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:41,102
But.

761
00:45:41,195 --> 00:45:42,735
it would be nice.

762
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,445
I think it's better for you to relax  sometimes.

763
00:45:46,258 --> 00:45:49,282
Come to think of it, I haven't had a chance to relax in a hot spring since I came here

764
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,172
I think I'll be bored by night

765
00:45:51,399 --> 00:45:52,766
Please.

766
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,180
I think that's fine.

767
00:45:57,961 --> 00:46:00,400
Oh, right,  can you call a Geisha?

768
00:46:01,016 --> 00:46:02,625
Eh? For you?

769
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,656
Excuse me.

770
00:46:32,195 --> 00:46:33,141
Come in.

771
00:46:40,945 --> 00:46:41,859
Good evening

772
00:46:46,609 --> 00:46:48,305
Are you alone?

773
00:47:09,515 --> 00:47:12,343
You kept quiet.

774
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:15,774
I'm confused.

775
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,031
I think I'll just ask you.

776
00:47:19,484 --> 00:47:19,969
What?

777
00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,445
You know, Are you thinking of marrying?

778
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:28,250
Marriage?

779
00:47:28,896 --> 00:47:30,735
the union of a man and a woman

780
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,875
What do you think?

781
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,219
I'm confused.

782
00:47:34,461 --> 00:47:37,914
Is that so? I'm having trouble too

783
00:47:38,414 --> 00:47:41,640
But have you ever loved someone before?

784
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:47,929
I don't really like fat people

785
00:47:48,975 --> 00:47:56,995
Oh yeah, you don't like fat people, so you don't like fat people

786
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,258
He's skinny, so that's ok

787
00:47:58,532 --> 00:47:59,548
What are your hobbies?

788
00:47:59,665 --> 00:48:00,931
My hobbies?

789
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:04,344
Sports Music Movies and Movies etc

790
00:48:04,759 --> 00:48:06,087
I like Music.

791
00:48:06,267 --> 00:48:06,907
Movies?

792
00:48:07,306 --> 00:48:07,970
Movies...

793
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:08,893
TV is better?

794
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:14,435
I don't like both.
Money is better

795
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,460
I can go to school, so

796
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:21,937
please excuse me.
here it is.

797
00:48:26,109 --> 00:48:27,336
I need this.

798
00:48:29,601 --> 00:48:30,318
Jun?

799
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:31,867
Yes.

800
00:48:33,593 --> 00:48:35,815
Oh, you're late

801
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:39,288
Yeah, I couldn't let go for a while .

802
00:48:39,422 --> 00:48:41,359
I tested her.
Have a seat.

803
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,650
Don't worry.
this girl is nice.

804
00:48:46,675 --> 00:48:47,369
I see

805
00:48:47,587 --> 00:48:49,476
Oh, what are you talking about?

806
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,173
Oh, sorry, sorry

807
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:54,025
Actually, everything I've been testing you.

808
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:57,470
Actually, he is really in love with you

809
00:48:57,470 --> 00:48:59,300
You don't have to say that in front of her.

810
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:01,350
He really wants to date you

811
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,020
I took your character test on his behalf

812
00:49:04,020 --> 00:49:05,372
Don't worry about it.

813
00:49:05,822 --> 00:49:06,986
Are you mad?

814
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:12,837
Well, my business is done

815
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,743
Please talk to each other.

816
00:49:15,791 --> 00:49:17,143
Stay here.

817
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:19,165
I guess no one will be there when you go home

818
00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:20,845
The bees are waiting for me.

819
00:49:20,870 --> 00:49:22,345
Excuse me.

820
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,673
Sorry, there is a call.

821
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:35,735
Yes, the doctor is here?

822
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:36,736
 in this room

823
00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:43,036
I've come all the way to this nice
place, but now there's a call, that's weird.

824
00:49:43,454 --> 00:49:45,031
I'm sorry to call you out.

825
00:49:45,056 --> 00:49:47,799
It's okay.
Have a drink

826
00:49:48,011 --> 00:49:48,643
Me?

827
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:51,075
Didn't you drink?

828
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:52,920
She brought it to me.

829
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:53,940
Just one please.

830
00:49:54,698 --> 00:49:55,464
Yeah.

831
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:04,464
This is good.

832
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:06,612
Let's have one more

833
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:12,840
Men are like this tatami rooms,

834
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,185
What kind of things do you talk about with the guys?

835
00:50:15,579 --> 00:50:18,106
There're many things.

836
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:18,661
For example?

837
00:50:18,966 --> 00:50:20,119
I feel embarrassed

838
00:50:20,144 --> 00:50:21,126
Tell me.

839
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:24,070
For example, the previous customer...

840
00:50:33,470 --> 00:50:35,945
He was still a good one.

841
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,306
All men do that, right?

842
00:50:38,766 --> 00:50:40,033
I see.

843
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,245
Here it is.

844
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:47,257
Oh thief!

845
00:50:49,497 --> 00:50:51,010
Help us!

846
00:50:51,425 --> 00:50:52,838
What's wrong?

847
00:50:56,028 --> 00:50:57,921
Be careful.

848
00:50:59,345 --> 00:51:02,965
Why you tired of peeking into other people's rooms?

849
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,000
He seduces her without my permission

850
00:51:06,025 --> 00:51:08,527
But that's a mistake

851
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,333
Yeah.

852
00:51:09,610 --> 00:51:11,240
That is absolutely unforgivable

853
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:13,910
I'm sorry, please.

854
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:16,650
In return, I'll listen to whatever you have to say tonight

855
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,670
This is fine, right?

856
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,061
Let's admit it

857
00:51:19,247 --> 00:51:19,847
forgive him.

858
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:20,389
Yeah,

859
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:23,674
thank you. So, I'll treat you tonight.

860
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:25,022
I want Oshiruko.

861
00:51:25,086 --> 00:51:25,708
I want Anmitsu

862
00:51:25,739 --> 00:51:26,517
I want sake

863
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,800
Is it okay?

864
00:51:28,302 --> 00:51:29,555
We won't drink much.

865
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,721
Okay, I will be serving tonight

866
00:51:54,143 --> 00:51:55,308
Hey

867
00:52:18,892 --> 00:52:21,185
Actually, that person has really strange.

868
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,240
He's paying a high education fee, but He sells honey now.

869
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,561
He shouldn't have gone
school from the beginning.

870
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:27,660
It's a waste.

871
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:30,400
But life comes with its own problems

872
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,190
There needs to be some waste

873
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,912
It is because of waste that we can do good things in life and it is wonderful

874
00:52:34,937 --> 00:52:35,879
That's right.

875
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:39,137
So let's have fun.

876
00:52:40,136 --> 00:52:41,714
Yeah!

877
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,816
It can't be helped.

878
00:53:21,672 --> 00:53:23,432
Keep going.

879
00:53:29,115 --> 00:53:31,080
Oh well, it's already twelve o'clock

880
00:53:32,676 --> 00:53:35,082
Yabuki doctor is not here yet?

881
00:53:35,659 --> 00:53:36,412
Not yet.

882
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:42,997
I'm thirsty.

883
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,916
It would be best if you took a rest

884
00:53:48,374 --> 00:53:50,596
I can't sleep

885
00:54:07,706 --> 00:54:10,011
What's wrong?

886
00:54:11,347 --> 00:54:13,704
Thank you very much.

887
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:17,003
Take care.

888
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:20,003
Are you ok?

889
00:54:27,268 --> 00:54:28,643
Good Good.

890
00:54:30,385 --> 00:54:32,206
That's good. Yes, I understand

891
00:54:35,706 --> 00:54:37,354
I'm so happy.

892
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:39,561
We all drank alcohol

893
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:44,380
I'm glad that so many geisha danced

894
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:50,620
doctor, I understand that you like alcohol.

895
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,526
I'm really sorry for being such a nuisance

896
00:54:56,490 --> 00:54:59,360
It's very rare for you to get drunk.

897
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,310
let's drink as much as we can today

898
00:55:06,563 --> 00:55:09,532
Yeah, bring some sake.

899
00:55:10,321 --> 00:55:15,391
After all, waste is necessary in a life.

900
00:55:16,932 --> 00:55:19,547
I studied really well tonight.

901
00:55:20,745 --> 00:55:21,862
Are you ok?

902
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,157
She's fine.

903
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,555
The she tackled.

904
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:27,024
No no, let's go.

905
00:55:28,681 --> 00:55:30,368
I'm ok.

906
00:55:31,883 --> 00:55:34,172
Leave it to me.

907
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:40,470
Be careful.

908
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:45,800
please pick up the pills later

909
00:55:45,954 --> 00:55:48,103
Don't worry about your sick.

910
00:55:48,128 --> 00:55:49,460
See you later

911
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:02,493
Hey come down!

912
00:57:14,195 --> 00:57:15,435
Everyone is doing well?

913
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:18,924
Today,Today I'm giving you honey.

914
00:57:23,141 --> 00:57:26,750
Be Quiet!  These are unsold hoeny.

915
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:40,948
Please come in. I know we are being noisy,

916
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:45,385
it's such a fun sight that I was just looking at it

917
00:57:45,410 --> 00:57:47,034
It's dirty here.

918
00:57:47,284 --> 00:57:49,245
Here is nursery school?

919
00:57:49,284 --> 00:57:51,620
They are without parents or siblings.

920
00:57:51,696 --> 00:57:55,752
they were particularly poor and orphaned.

921
00:57:56,237 --> 00:57:57,776
Do you take care of them?

922
00:57:57,801 --> 00:58:00,365
No.
This is a government project.

923
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:05,120
In fact, it is run by a man who sells honey.

924
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,186
so please come in

925
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:10,276
I'm leaving soon.

926
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:26,416
I'm making a tea now.

927
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:41,330
It's about Masahiko,
but he somehow managed to make up with his father?

928
00:58:42,003 --> 00:58:43,612
Well...

929
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:49,830
Yes, even the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union is beginning to thaw

930
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:56,643
I also think it's about time, but they are...

931
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:59,663
But why you ask me?

932
00:59:00,126 --> 00:59:01,540
It's not a big deal.

933
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,640
But I thought Masahiko had such a good point

934
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:10,307
That's because I raised him

935
00:59:10,386 --> 00:59:12,151
You are like his mom.

936
00:59:12,199 --> 00:59:16,081
But his father always gets angry at his son.

937
00:59:16,222 --> 00:59:17,815
But he's nice.

938
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:20,850
He graduated from medical school with honors.

939
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:24,854
He was highly respected by the female students.

940
00:59:25,112 --> 00:59:28,041
Appearances are not what they seem.

941
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:33,573
Doctor.

942
00:59:35,945 --> 00:59:39,487
What do you think of a person like Masahiko?

943
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:40,987
What do you mean?
.

944
00:59:41,196 --> 00:59:46,176
For example, if you had to divide it into likes and dislikes, which would you choose?

945
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:50,360
Yeah, I don't really dislike him.

946
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:52,768
Doctor

947
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:55,463
Look at this.

948
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,251
Is it okay to do something like that?

949
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,594
Yes I am

950
00:59:58,742 --> 00:59:59,945
It's not okay.

951
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:03,687
Doctor, someone committed suicide.

952
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:04,798
Suicide?

953
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,900
Now it's okay, it's good now

954
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:24,174
The amount was small, It was fine

955
01:00:25,408 --> 01:00:27,111
It wasn't serious case.

956
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:30,335
So there are various reasons why young women commit suicide

957
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,588
this is a special case

958
01:00:32,732 --> 01:00:35,424
She was committing suicide because she can't have a child

959
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,244
You are too happy.

960
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:40,830
That's what I say. Even if we can't have children,

961
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:42,548
our love for each other won't change

962
01:00:42,807 --> 01:00:44,971
We can have as many children as we want when we can

963
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:46,935
That's not true

964
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,040
If you can't have a baby

965
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:53,518
It means, you lack love as a husband.

966
01:00:55,050 --> 01:00:56,901
I was frustrated by that

967
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,917
You have to sleep quietly

968
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,218
Anyway, she's so emotional

969
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:07,249
as a husband and a wife,

970
01:01:07,637 --> 01:01:10,335
She wants to have children as proof that.

971
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:12,660
I don't know how we'll be able to have children

972
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,980
Um, well, you're young so it's okay

973
01:01:15,005 --> 01:01:18,745
So I came here because I heard that this good hot spring for that.

974
01:01:18,816 --> 01:01:19,574
it didn't work?

975
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:21,303
but it didn't work at all

976
01:01:21,721 --> 01:01:24,425
I feel like I'm getting too tired from taking baths

977
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,280
We sleeps all day and She's finally getting annoyed with me

978
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:31,090
She says it's my husband's fault.

979
01:01:31,374 --> 01:01:35,055
She was going to die, and finally she took the medicine

980
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:39,461
Anyway, take care of yourself

981
01:01:40,625 --> 01:01:42,277
You're so cold.

982
01:01:42,402 --> 01:01:42,914
Why?

983
01:01:42,938 --> 01:01:45,980
the problem have not been solved yet?

984
01:01:46,492 --> 01:01:50,214
doctor, please tell me how to have a baby

985
01:01:50,245 --> 01:01:52,041
Don't ask her about that.

986
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:55,429
After all, that is more God's domain than doctors.

987
01:01:55,477 --> 01:01:57,371
We pray a lot.

988
01:01:57,485 --> 01:01:58,778
I see.

989
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,705
So let me give you this

990
01:02:05,996 --> 01:02:06,836
What's this?

991
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:07,998
This is female thermometers.

992
01:02:08,324 --> 01:02:10,330
You should rest and take their thermometers from time to time

993
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:15,772
Just when you got up to this area, It will be good chance.

994
01:02:15,946 --> 01:02:17,703
The conception rate is very high at this time

995
01:02:18,537 --> 01:02:21,690
I didn't know about this.

996
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:23,470
This is awesome.

997
01:02:23,470 --> 01:02:26,252
However, the responsibility is ultimately on God

998
01:02:39,870 --> 01:02:41,050
Give me one cup.

999
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:45,749
Oh doctor.

1000
01:02:47,188 --> 01:02:50,955
I heard about you.
You were having trouble.

1001
01:02:51,257 --> 01:02:53,095
There are people who don't want to have children in the future,

1002
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:57,400
and there are people who want children so badly they're going to die. The world is diverse

1003
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:01,060
doctor, I've decided too

1004
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:03,550
Of course, I'll give a birth.

1005
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,790
I've also changed my mind after hearing what you just said,

1006
01:03:05,904 --> 01:03:06,684
One tea please.

1007
01:03:07,424 --> 01:03:10,892
I'll try to raise him on my own

1008
01:03:10,988 --> 01:03:12,368
So you can't take this.

1009
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,617
Let's dance.

1010
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:16,145
With you?

1011
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,240
You don't feel good ?

1012
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,000
I was hit by that couple from earlier

1013
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,402
You're getting used to here.

1014
01:03:51,574 --> 01:03:52,540
Darling.

1015
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,809
The doctor from before was very kind

1016
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:01,442
Why don't you reply?

1017
01:04:01,888 --> 01:04:03,388
It was good bath.

1018
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,662
Put the slipper off.

1019
01:04:06,362 --> 01:04:09,462
I can sleep well tonight.

1020
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,670
You are just into sleeping.

1021
01:04:12,695 --> 01:04:16,103
We need taking a break.

1022
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:27,307
Oh it's time.

1023
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:30,120
Body temperature increased.

1024
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:32,363
Uh, where?

1025
01:04:33,365 --> 01:04:34,305
Oh yeah.

1026
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:37,833
The doctor said that if you get this far, you have a chance

1027
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:39,872
This is our chance.

1028
01:04:40,165 --> 01:04:42,652
But it's too soon.

1029
01:04:42,819 --> 01:04:44,539
This is our chance.

1030
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:48,486
We can't miss this chance!

1031
01:04:50,624 --> 01:04:52,530
I'm here to massage...

1032
01:04:52,530 --> 01:04:54,960
but did you ask the masseuse?

1033
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,691
I didn't expect something like this to happen so suddenly

1034
01:04:56,716 --> 01:04:58,511
You are so mean.

1035
01:05:00,795 --> 01:05:02,888
See what happens...

1036
01:05:07,303 --> 01:05:08,959
Excuse me.

1037
01:05:23,732 --> 01:05:25,342
Excuse me.

1038
01:05:28,136 --> 01:05:29,385
Good morning

1039
01:05:29,450 --> 01:05:31,208
Good morning.

1040
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:34,980
I want to give you some juice now.

1041
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,521
My head still hurts a little

1042
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:37,670
How about giving her an injection?

1043
01:05:37,911 --> 01:05:40,611
It won't work.

1044
01:05:40,977 --> 01:05:43,827
At times like this, take a walk

1045
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:45,580
Fortunately, we are closed today

1046
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,865
The weather is nice, so let's go for a walk

1047
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:49,638
Walking is also good for high blood pressure.

1048
01:05:49,663 --> 01:05:52,700
Maybe I'll show you the source of one of the hot springs?

1049
01:05:52,725 --> 01:05:54,349
Thanks.

1050
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,892
Do you like this kind of place?

1051
01:06:11,483 --> 01:06:13,753
I love this kind of environment

1052
01:06:13,872 --> 01:06:16,792
I came out to show you Hot spring source.

1053
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:21,547
Doctor, There is a nursing home where Masahiko works.

1054
01:06:21,801 --> 01:06:24,463
I don't know at all.

1055
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:27,125
Please go there.

1056
01:06:28,247 --> 01:06:29,273
I don't wanna go.

1057
01:06:29,871 --> 01:06:31,218
I don't wanna go either.

1058
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:34,145
You can go there.

1059
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:35,413
I will wait around here.

1060
01:06:36,047 --> 01:06:37,533
You are stubborn.

1061
01:06:42,876 --> 01:06:44,755
I don't wanna see his face.

1062
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:08,132
Isn't it delicious?

1063
01:07:10,321 --> 01:07:10,988
Yeah

1064
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,360
It's kinda good.

1065
01:07:13,870 --> 01:07:17,080
With a honey tree, some egg yolks,

1066
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:19,269
some garlic and mix it with the queen bee's urine

1067
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:24,188
But it's going to work well, so things will be getting exciting

1068
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:29,651
I see, I'm getting better.

1069
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:31,426
Yes I think so.

1070
01:07:31,525 --> 01:07:33,265
It's definitely working.

1071
01:07:35,627 --> 01:07:36,673
I'll have this.

1072
01:07:36,813 --> 01:07:38,406
Where are you going?

1073
01:07:39,210 --> 01:07:42,047
Someone is waiting for me

1074
01:07:45,108 --> 01:07:48,785
Oh, you left this.

1075
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,070
Thank you.

1076
01:07:50,378 --> 01:07:52,272
I'm getting better.

1077
01:07:57,085 --> 01:07:59,669
Masahiko-san,
You're good

1078
01:07:59,921 --> 01:08:00,844
What for?

1079
01:08:01,002 --> 01:08:03,222
You are very good at hypnosis.

1080
01:08:03,503 --> 01:08:05,575
Did you just see that?

1081
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:08,348
 a cup of honey and egg yolk.

1082
01:08:08,479 --> 01:08:09,766
Do you want it?

1083
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:12,850
I'd better not take it, otherwise I'll be in trouble

1084
01:08:12,911 --> 01:08:14,571
Actually it works well.

1085
01:08:15,779 --> 01:08:16,959
Are you making this?

1086
01:08:17,413 --> 01:08:18,685
Oh this?

1087
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:22,855
Indian Jabok is a medicine for high blood pressure.

1088
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:24,749
That's about it

1089
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:26,387
This is for your dad?

1090
01:08:26,646 --> 01:08:29,160
I just made it as a test.

1091
01:08:29,650 --> 01:08:30,988
You have filial piety.

1092
01:08:31,428 --> 01:08:33,374
No way.

1093
01:08:39,852 --> 01:08:42,446
What are you doing?

1094
01:08:44,815 --> 01:08:46,802
What are you doing too?

1095
01:08:47,032 --> 01:08:48,585
Be quiet.

1096
01:08:49,024 --> 01:08:51,349
Are you here to see your son?

1097
01:08:51,726 --> 01:08:54,516
Don't say stupid things. Who is thinking about him?

1098
01:09:00,071 --> 01:09:01,357
Doctor.

1099
01:09:01,563 --> 01:09:04,512
This is good for high blood pressure.
Drink it

1100
01:09:04,587 --> 01:09:05,240
Bee?

1101
01:09:05,527 --> 01:09:06,773
I can't drink it.

1102
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:08,967
You're stubborn.

1103
01:09:09,285 --> 01:09:11,605
you are here to see your son.

1104
01:09:11,630 --> 01:09:13,176
Be quiet.

1105
01:09:23,026 --> 01:09:26,247
You must be tired, doctor

1106
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,057
Congratulations!

1107
01:09:30,032 --> 01:09:30,960
Read it!

1108
01:09:33,688 --> 01:09:35,689
It's from Professor Shiota in Tokyo.

1109
01:09:36,157 --> 01:09:41,159
I was pretty sure that your essay was based on the hot spring therapy

1110
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,570
Apparently, that was brought up by the professor

1111
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:48,108
So, they really want you to come back to the university,

1112
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:50,450
and I received a letter addressed to you.
Read it.

1113
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:54,749
That's good for you.

1114
01:09:56,077 --> 01:09:59,201
I'm glad. Your path has been decided

1115
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:03,670
After all, it's better to study in Tokyo

1116
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:08,862
It's farewell.

1117
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:44,339
It's farewell, let's celebrate.

1118
01:10:46,650 --> 01:10:51,792
It's a shame that you've gotten used to it, but there's nothing we can do about it

1119
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:56,229
I'm looking for a new doctor.

1120
01:10:56,855 --> 01:10:59,534
Hi, Grandma?

1121
01:11:03,174 --> 01:11:04,706
Masahiko is stupid.

1122
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:08,753
Here it is.

1123
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:12,065
Me?

1124
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,167
What?

1125
01:11:14,590 --> 01:11:17,909
Are you pulling her out?

1126
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:18,980
Is that bad?

1127
01:11:19,175 --> 01:11:22,095
I've never heard of such a thing.

1128
01:11:22,133 --> 01:11:24,398
Joshi is going to be a geisha's husband

1129
01:11:24,575 --> 01:11:27,737
The only thing I'm worried about is money

1130
01:11:28,565 --> 01:11:30,955
Maybe this will work.

1131
01:11:30,980 --> 01:11:33,140
I've been saving up until now,

1132
01:11:33,165 --> 01:11:34,159
Let me see.

1133
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:36,415
It's okay

1134
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,159
She has no debt.

1135
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:41,210
I'm just asking for reference

1136
01:11:41,235 --> 01:11:43,018
What would you do to pull her out?

1137
01:11:44,235 --> 01:11:46,740
Are you guys lesbian?

1138
01:11:46,820 --> 01:11:50,519
No, I want Kichiya to quit being a geisha

1139
01:11:50,874 --> 01:11:52,637
and go to nursing school

1140
01:11:53,710 --> 01:11:54,816
Oh I see.

1141
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:57,526
I'm very happy to hear that.

1142
01:11:57,761 --> 01:12:00,401
I feel sorry.

1143
01:12:00,690 --> 01:12:02,534
There's nothing to be hesitate.

1144
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,925
Doctors make a lot of money.

1145
01:12:04,964 --> 01:12:06,518
That's not true.

1146
01:12:06,543 --> 01:12:09,667
I will tell my mother right away.

1147
01:12:10,325 --> 01:12:14,705
Let's celebrate together tonight for the pre-celebration.

1148
01:12:15,260 --> 01:12:17,581
Someone is visiting you.

1149
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,407
Oh you called me.

1150
01:12:58,857 --> 01:12:59,770
Congratulation.

1151
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,478
I heard it from Otani.

1152
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:02,258
I see.

1153
01:13:02,316 --> 01:13:03,483
Are you back in Tokyo?

1154
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:06,812
I'm sure my dad will miss you.

1155
01:13:07,425 --> 01:13:09,903
He's stubborn, but lonely.

1156
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,045
Whatever it is, you should go home.

1157
01:13:12,076 --> 01:13:14,083
No, that and this are different

1158
01:13:14,969 --> 01:13:16,935
Now, I have a favor to ask of you

1159
01:13:16,987 --> 01:13:18,154
What?

1160
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:22,370
Could you please deliver this to my father?

1161
01:13:25,747 --> 01:13:28,524
Indian Jabok, for high blood pressure.

1162
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:33,762
I finally made it because it seems to help with high blood pressure

1163
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,392
If I bring it, he gets excited again

1164
01:13:37,270 --> 01:13:38,878
I'm sure he'll drink it if you bring it

1165
01:13:41,913 --> 01:13:45,336
Well, That's all.

1166
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:49,505
We kept fighting, but it was fun.

1167
01:13:49,769 --> 01:13:50,682
See you then.

1168
01:13:55,918 --> 01:13:57,970
Masahiko-san, Let's dance.

1169
01:13:58,990 --> 01:13:59,857
to say goodbye

1170
01:14:02,202 --> 01:14:03,516
Can you dance?

1171
01:14:03,622 --> 01:14:04,883
Don't make fun of me.

1172
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:12,216
I'm good at it.

1173
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,794
Have another one.
Give me a usual one.

1174
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,221
Stop messing around and go home.

1175
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:26,050
If you apologize, that will be the end of it

1176
01:14:26,075 --> 01:14:27,053
Please do it.

1177
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:30,907
Yes, I really like this place

1178
01:14:31,690 --> 01:14:36,737
Returning to Tokyo, I pushed through the fierce competition for survival

1179
01:14:37,491 --> 01:14:39,369
It's much better to live here.

1180
01:14:40,143 --> 01:14:41,104
So...

1181
01:14:42,096 --> 01:14:43,135
I won't go.

1182
01:14:44,025 --> 01:14:48,150
Well then, I tell you
I've liked you from the start.

1183
01:14:48,854 --> 01:14:49,956
But I'm older.

1184
01:14:50,423 --> 01:14:51,407
I don't mind

1185
01:14:51,971 --> 01:14:53,471
I'm too strong-willed.

1186
01:14:53,496 --> 01:14:54,315
I don't mind

1187
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:57,221
I'll make you a doctor as your father's successor.

1188
01:14:59,456 --> 01:15:00,635
I don't mind

1189
01:15:32,853 --> 01:15:34,247
Ready?

1190
01:15:36,590 --> 01:15:38,177
Once again.

1191
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:39,685
Once again?

1192
01:15:42,825 --> 01:15:43,715
Okay,

1193
01:15:46,498 --> 01:15:48,318
I'll give you honey.

1194
01:15:53,318 --> 01:15:54,778
No no.

1195
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:03,405
Congratulation.

1196
01:16:03,437 --> 01:16:05,870
Doctor!

1197
01:16:05,895 --> 01:16:07,026
I'd like to ask you a favor

1198
01:16:07,051 --> 01:16:08,845
We are closed today.

1199
01:16:09,166 --> 01:16:11,321
Woman collapsed in bath again

1200
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:12,320
Oh no...

1201
01:16:13,322 --> 01:16:14,654
Then I'll go

1202
01:16:17,046 --> 01:16:19,592
I'll go.

1203
01:16:19,815 --> 01:16:22,085
But you're dressed like that

1204
01:16:22,110 --> 01:16:23,401
You have high blood pressure.

1205
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:25,128
It's ok.

1206
01:16:25,638 --> 01:16:28,247
Ok I will take you there.

1207
01:16:28,605 --> 01:16:29,705
I sit here

1208
01:16:29,730 --> 01:16:31,976
It is like a honeymoon

1209
01:16:35,785 --> 01:16:37,631
What a honeymoon.

1210
01:16:37,977 --> 01:16:40,499
Are you crying?

1211
01:16:41,007 --> 01:16:42,015
Shut up!

1212
01:17:01,832 --> 01:17:03,432
Don't call me doctor anymore.

1213
01:17:03,893 --> 01:17:04,733
How about me?

1214
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:06,073
You're my husband.

1215
01:17:06,672 --> 01:17:07,546
Say it again.

1216
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:09,857
My husband.

1217
01:17:26,941 --> 01:17:36,819
THE END

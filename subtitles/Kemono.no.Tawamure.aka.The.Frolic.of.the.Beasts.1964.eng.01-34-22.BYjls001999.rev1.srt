00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:22,139
<i>Kemono no Tawamure / The Frolic of the Beasts (1964)</i>

3
00:01:41,126 --> 00:01:45,361
I can't believe this sun and that sun are the same.

4
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,036
What are you doing?

5
00:02:34,817 --> 00:02:36,341
Get down.

6
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,369
Come in.

7
00:02:57,542 --> 00:02:58,409
625

8
00:03:02,424 --> 00:03:03,932
You received another letter from her.

9
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:05,635
Thank you very much.

10
00:03:08,409 --> 00:03:11,018
This smells like a woman.

11
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:14,283
You are stingy.
Let me smell it.

12
00:03:14,308 --> 00:03:15,026
Cut it out.

13
00:03:15,057 --> 00:03:16,752
Will you go see her as soon as you get out of jail?

14
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:18,135
Are you envy him?

15
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:20,151
What's the hell?

16
00:03:20,362 --> 00:03:21,979
What she said?

17
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:24,135
Tell me.

18
00:03:24,315 --> 00:03:25,456
Shut up.

19
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,549
What's the hell?

20
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:28,987
Damn it.

21
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:37,409
I'm only thinking about getting you out of jail.

22
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:42,105
Sometimes I get very anxious.

23
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:48,238
Please work hard at the prison until the end.

24
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:55,128
Please come see me as soon as you get out of jail.

25
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:58,355
Please come.

26
00:04:00,613 --> 00:04:02,925
I wanna see you.

27
00:04:03,753 --> 00:04:06,332
Please listen to my request.

28
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,160
If you don't like seeing me, you can go home.

29
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:20,253
I'll clean your clothes and your room.

30
00:04:22,003 --> 00:04:25,558
I'm so sorry that I couldn't come to pick you up.

31
00:04:27,207 --> 00:04:30,543
I can't leave that person behind.

32
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,050
Please understand me.

33
00:04:34,628 --> 00:04:38,324
But I will pick you up at the bridge.

34
00:04:39,902 --> 00:04:45,066
I don't wanna see you but I want to apologize to that person.

35
00:04:47,472 --> 00:04:49,707
I'd rather not have met you.

36
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:02,036
Is Madam here?

37
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:03,083
Yes.

38
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,560
This is a gift from our president.

39
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:05,787
I'll give it to her.

40
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,474
He asked me to give it to her.

41
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:11,857
Are you new worker?

42
00:05:12,177 --> 00:05:14,029
I'm part time student worker.

43
00:05:22,146 --> 00:05:24,990
A new staff member is here.

44
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,693
Thank you for your work.

45
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:30,920
This.

46
00:05:31,607 --> 00:05:33,006
It's a very hot day today, isn't it?

47
00:05:33,412 --> 00:05:34,771
Please rest.

48
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:36,818
Do you still have a job?

49
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:38,014
I've finished.

50
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:41,919
Come in.
Serve him a drink.

51
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:54,065
I'll do it.

52
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:10,377
This is not what I ordered.

53
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:11,760
Shall I exchange it?

54
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,604
Don't worry.

55
00:06:14,572 --> 00:06:16,846
It's our fault.

56
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:23,236
Come in.

57
00:06:30,821 --> 00:06:34,086
That is a very beautiful flower.

58
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:35,032
Yeah.

59
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:38,109
Growing flowers is difficult.

60
00:06:38,368 --> 00:06:39,922
Are you into flowers?

61
00:06:40,688 --> 00:06:42,071
I like beautiful things.

62
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:44,954
That's unusual for young people.

63
00:06:46,969 --> 00:06:48,649
Shall I show you?

64
00:06:59,345 --> 00:07:00,962
This is awesome.

65
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:03,189
Look at this.

66
00:07:04,736 --> 00:07:07,423
This rose is very beautiful.

67
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,907
Are roses the king of flowers?

68
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:14,711
Some people call Yoron the king of flowers.

69
00:07:15,486 --> 00:07:18,087
This is the flower called Alba.

70
00:07:18,728 --> 00:07:20,954
This red flower is a hybrid Catria.

71
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:22,579
This is a very beautiful flower, isn't it?

72
00:07:22,986 --> 00:07:24,353
This is too much for me.

73
00:07:24,837 --> 00:07:27,243
Men like this flower.

74
00:07:27,931 --> 00:07:31,126
The petals of this flower are like a vase.

75
00:07:32,384 --> 00:07:36,861
This is a flower that eats insects.

76
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:39,509
This is a flower that tempts

77
00:07:40,173 --> 00:07:41,376
It's weird.

78
00:07:42,751 --> 00:07:44,884
You are a coward.

79
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,079
Look at this.

80
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:50,142
This is awesome.

81
00:07:50,321 --> 00:07:52,189
This is a mysterious flower called Jim.

82
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,532
white flowers are rare.

83
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:56,939
This is awesome.

84
00:07:57,423 --> 00:07:59,314
If you want one, I'll give you one.

85
00:08:00,134 --> 00:08:00,650
Really?

86
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:01,931
Don't worry.

87
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:06,813
Are you also studying at Toa University?

88
00:08:06,838 --> 00:08:08,657
Yes.
President is my senior.

89
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:10,985
Are you a student of the Faculty of Culture?

90
00:08:11,227 --> 00:08:14,907
I'm a law student.
However, I have read all the books written by my president.

91
00:08:15,751 --> 00:08:18,071
But his writing is very difficult.

92
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,196
He really likes writing.
But I hate it.

93
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:24,969
His books are very valuable.

94
00:08:25,431 --> 00:08:27,017
It just has rarity value.

95
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:33,329
Since you are studying law, will you become a judge in the future?

96
00:08:33,532 --> 00:08:37,720
I don't like people judging people.

97
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,852
But why are you studying law?

98
00:08:40,657 --> 00:08:42,759
Laws judge people.

99
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:47,540
I'm just into it.

100
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:51,079
Only God can judge humans.

101
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,423
God?

102
00:08:55,931 --> 00:08:56,907
It could be.

103
00:09:00,368 --> 00:09:03,048
I have to go back.

104
00:09:11,453 --> 00:09:14,609
This coffee set is perfect as a gift.

105
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:19,156
If you want something a little more luxurious, you can find it here.

106
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:25,117
It's a little expensive, but I think you can afford it.

107
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,296
His wife is nice,right?

108
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,764
I'll have this.

109
00:09:36,045 --> 00:09:36,943
Thank you very much.

110
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,248
Please deliver here.

111
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,701
We'll handle it.

112
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:42,568
Please.

113
00:09:43,482 --> 00:09:45,240
Thank you very much.

114
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:56,617
Did you deliver it to your wife? She said she wanted something different.

115
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,570
Whatever.

116
00:10:06,598 --> 00:10:09,184
Let's go out to eat after work.

117
00:10:10,372 --> 00:10:15,887
I want to drink alcohol with young people like you.

118
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,854
I envy you because you have no parents, siblings, or relatives.

119
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,770
I hate people with guarantees.

120
00:10:33,826 --> 00:10:36,073
And you have a lot of money.

121
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,293
My dad left money to me.

122
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:41,503
But I worry.

123
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:45,383
No problem.
You can work at out store.

124
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,213
Thanks.

125
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,783
You're 21 and alone.
You are free.

126
00:10:53,702 --> 00:10:57,008
Do you sometimes consider yourself a romantic?

127
00:10:58,335 --> 00:11:00,535
You have a beautifuk future.

128
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:05,899
You'll only have happy future.

129
00:11:07,118 --> 00:11:10,671
You would not be anxious about your future.

130
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:11,695
I have.

131
00:11:12,165 --> 00:11:13,239
I'm sometime frustrated.

132
00:11:13,545 --> 00:11:14,918
That's your beauty.

133
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:18,695
I've lived my life with the wind in my sails.

134
00:11:19,931 --> 00:11:21,831
It's a good thing you can be angry.

135
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:25,590
So you're saying that I'm an average person.

136
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm just envious of your purity.

137
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:29,810
Give me water.

138
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,453
What are you doing?

139
00:11:36,093 --> 00:11:37,220
Gymnastics?

140
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:40,273
Radio exercises.
It's a great feeling.

141
00:11:44,396 --> 00:11:47,189
My wife is strange.

142
00:11:48,017 --> 00:11:49,803
I've never seen a woman like her.

143
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,617
She's beautiful.

144
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:54,367
That's no way to treat a woman your age.

145
00:11:55,312 --> 00:11:56,386
My wife is strange.

146
00:11:57,358 --> 00:11:59,565
She's never been jealous.

147
00:12:00,147 --> 00:12:05,347
Wives are usually jealous.
If you get a wife you will know.

148
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,120
She's not.

149
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:13,807
She's never surprised.
I've seen her shoot right in front of her, and she'll just lightly turn her head away.

150
00:12:14,635 --> 00:12:17,867
I'm sure your wife is very good at hiding her emotions.
Maybe it's her ego

151
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:23,556
Nice point of view, good analysis.
That's probably about it.

152
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,030
But you think she does not love me?

153
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,587
She loves me a lot.

154
00:12:31,142 --> 00:12:33,309
I can feel about her love.

155
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,637
She's hiding her emotions.

156
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:38,438
She pretends to be cool like water.

157
00:12:39,235 --> 00:12:45,488
I'd have sex with a girl in front of her if it would make her heart flutter.

158
00:12:46,626 --> 00:12:48,380
And I have to tell you, I don't hate her.

159
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:53,868
I'm ashamed to admit it, but...
I don't hate any woman who loves me.

160
00:12:54,486 --> 00:12:55,672
Even if it's my wife.

161
00:13:08,632 --> 00:13:10,939
He's got this new mistress, she's stripper.

162
00:13:11,245 --> 00:13:13,379
She's from Southeast Asia.

163
00:13:13,927 --> 00:13:16,540
He likes tanned women.

164
00:13:17,412 --> 00:13:19,019
He was dating with fisher woman before.

165
00:13:19,317 --> 00:13:21,537
What happened about the nurse?

166
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,833
He was dumped.

167
00:13:23,946 --> 00:13:26,093
I don't understand what he's thinking.

168
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:28,263
He has a beautiful wife.

169
00:13:28,288 --> 00:13:30,453
You know, no matter how beautiful it is, something's missing.

170
00:13:31,594 --> 00:13:32,394
It could be.

171
00:13:38,226 --> 00:13:39,792
And..she's coming.

172
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,046
Welcome.

173
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:47,026
The oysters you delivered the other day, I still don't like them.

174
00:13:47,175 --> 00:13:47,935
I'm here to exchange them.

175
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,075
If you had told me, I would have come to exchange them.

176
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,675
I was just coming by.

177
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:55,412
I'm sorry, sir.
I made a mistake.

178
00:13:55,745 --> 00:13:57,072
It's not your fault.

179
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:00,138
This is what I want.

180
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:00,933
This?

181
00:14:01,047 --> 00:14:02,200
It's next to it.

182
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:04,908
I'll deliver it to you on my way home today.

183
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:09,682
If it's convenient, you can bring it with you.

184
00:14:13,456 --> 00:14:17,969
My husband took you to the bar the other night?

185
00:14:20,409 --> 00:14:22,889
You've been drinking to talk about me, haven't you?

186
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:23,816
No way.

187
00:14:23,849 --> 00:14:25,596
Be honest.

188
00:14:26,797 --> 00:14:33,223
He told you I was strange?
He must have a mistress when he'd talk about me.

189
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,403
He's sick.
It's just so sad.

190
00:14:40,915 --> 00:14:43,215
His new girl is a stripper from southeast Asia.

191
00:14:44,135 --> 00:14:46,742
You guys know about it?

192
00:14:48,974 --> 00:14:52,694
You know that, and you're really okay with it?

193
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,974
So what?

194
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm used to it.

195
00:14:59,294 --> 00:15:00,954
It's not an insult.

196
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,940
I can't live if I can't feel.

197
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:07,845
You don't feel jealous at all?

198
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,031
He wants his wife to be jealous.

199
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:16,483
You want me to be jealous?

200
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:24,640
You're so nosy.
I've had enough of your nosiness.

201
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:42,221
Have a drink.

202
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,474
You know I can't drink.

203
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:47,358
I wanna make you get drunk.

204
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,353
I feel disgusting.

205
00:15:50,677 --> 00:15:51,650
Try it.

206
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,923
What's so good about it?

207
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:57,018
Just like you like flowers.

208
00:15:57,658 --> 00:15:58,818
What's so good about it?

209
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:00,605
You don't understand.

210
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:06,879
It's better to make a melon or a banana or something.

211
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,273
You're so utilitarian.

212
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:14,821
Maybe that's what keeps you from devouring him.

213
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:24,352
I can't understand about you.

214
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:28,952
You know, I was warned by that man today about your dilettantism.

215
00:16:29,164 --> 00:16:32,124
Who told you?

216
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:39,903
It's all right for you to be unfaithful.
You don't have to go to the trouble of informing everyone in the shop.

217
00:16:41,203 --> 00:16:45,023
I'll fire him.

218
00:16:46,035 --> 00:16:48,782
You don't have to.

219
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,165
He worries about us.

220
00:16:52,737 --> 00:16:57,037
He's innocent compared to those who whisper about him behind his back.

221
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:03,084
But he's a bit much for a hired hand.

222
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,442
Don't get upset.

223
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:07,702
I have to go.

224
00:17:19,158 --> 00:17:21,451
You don't need to worry about what he just said.

225
00:17:22,827 --> 00:17:25,841
Ma'am.
I'm really sorry about today.

226
00:17:27,924 --> 00:17:29,064
But I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

227
00:17:29,411 --> 00:17:31,244
You don't have to worry about that.

228
00:17:32,364 --> 00:17:33,564
Excuse me.

229
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,712
Thanks for the other day.

230
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,829
You probably don't know how funny her is yet, but...

231
00:18:55,737 --> 00:18:58,724
I think today's blinds are a little cooler.

232
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:01,281
Like this.
She's crazy.

233
00:19:01,771 --> 00:19:03,338
How dare you.

234
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:08,706
She's not as beautiful as my wife.
She's fool.

235
00:19:09,461 --> 00:19:10,808
I'm sorry.

236
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,634
She's a bit of an exhibitionist.

237
00:19:14,408 --> 00:19:17,188
That's what I like about her.

238
00:19:17,872 --> 00:19:18,812
How dare you.

239
00:19:18,952 --> 00:19:22,865
She's got a way of making love that's... hilarious, and sometimes she gets a little crazy.

240
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,160
I'll get crazy and have sex with her.

241
00:19:27,379 --> 00:19:30,812
Compared with my wife, My wife is too boring.

242
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:34,655
She's too ordinary.

243
00:19:36,424 --> 00:19:37,764
What do you mean?

244
00:19:38,661 --> 00:19:42,094
It's a wonder you're not tired when you play with her.

245
00:19:42,365 --> 00:19:44,698
Come on, Dad, let's go home.

246
00:19:45,166 --> 00:19:46,286
It's over.

247
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:47,460
It's over.

248
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:48,755
Get dressed.

249
00:19:49,008 --> 00:19:50,375
I don't have to.

250
00:19:50,635 --> 00:19:51,641
She's like that.

251
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,627
I'll leave.

252
00:19:56,585 --> 00:20:01,045
Excuse me, but could you go home and tell my wife I'm not coming home for a couple of days?

253
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,280
That's unusual.

254
00:20:08,086 --> 00:20:12,960
He never told me when he won't back home.

255
00:20:14,492 --> 00:20:15,899
Sorry to tell you.

256
00:20:16,165 --> 00:20:17,352
It's not your fault.

257
00:20:19,229 --> 00:20:21,989
He's just trying to pick on me, as usual.

258
00:20:26,778 --> 00:20:31,585
I'm afraid I tell you.
But you're not going to solve anything if you just suffer.

259
00:20:32,407 --> 00:20:36,894
It can't be helped.
It doesn't solve anything.

260
00:20:39,532 --> 00:20:42,452
It's a maze of suffering with no way out.

261
00:20:44,027 --> 00:20:45,307
I know.

262
00:20:46,653 --> 00:20:47,979
Our  president is completely arrogant.

263
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:52,474
From our point of view, he's a terrible person.
He doesn't care about you in any way.

264
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,030
He may have lost his youth.
But he played around a lot.

265
00:20:57,431 --> 00:21:01,618
What I can't forgive is the fact that he sacrificed his wife.

266
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:04,013
He's a terrible person.

267
00:21:09,862 --> 00:21:11,242
Ma'am.

268
00:21:12,399 --> 00:21:13,046
Ma'am.

269
00:21:13,392 --> 00:21:15,006
Anyone there?

270
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,779
Ma'am.

271
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:18,285
Ma'am.

272
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,068
She sometime is like that.

273
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,767
Cerebral anemia?

274
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:39,879
Do you have any alcohol?

275
00:21:40,287 --> 00:21:41,580
I'll just have a glass of wine.

276
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:46,938
Call doctor.

277
00:21:47,151 --> 00:21:47,791
OK.

278
00:22:45,395 --> 00:22:46,562
I'm alright.

279
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:48,442
Sorry.

280
00:22:50,072 --> 00:22:52,232
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say it.

281
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:54,018
Don't worry.

282
00:22:58,097 --> 00:22:59,004
Thank you very much.

283
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:19,059
Koji.

284
00:23:20,175 --> 00:23:20,815
What?

285
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,408
Open the drawer.

286
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,677
You'll find some papers in there.

287
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,099
Read them.

288
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:48,221
It's all about my husband's women.

289
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:51,368
About Machiko

290
00:23:53,697 --> 00:23:55,070
Did you ask to do this?

291
00:23:55,672 --> 00:23:56,632
Yes.

292
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,721
I know everything.

293
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,973
But don't ever tell my husband about this.

294
00:24:10,344 --> 00:24:11,918
I'm happy just to know.

295
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:17,854
It's the only thing that keeps me alive now that he doesn't know.

296
00:24:19,349 --> 00:24:21,362
You must keep it a secret.

297
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,487
If you betray me

298
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:27,991
I'd die.

299
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:37,677
How often I am frustrated with that person.

300
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,446
What frustrating and strange days they were.

301
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:45,558
An unhappy, desperate woman and a carefree man

302
00:24:46,171 --> 00:24:48,578
and me, hot-blooded and sympathetic

303
00:24:50,412 --> 00:24:56,965
I guess I didn't realize at the time that the simple scheme hid a terrible trap

304
00:25:00,768 --> 00:25:03,582
Yamada-san, Kinoshita-san, go to the first ward.

305
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:09,513
The only abnormality I can think of is some low blood pressure, but that's just my nature.

306
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:14,732
Dizziness like yours has a strong name: dysautonomia.

307
00:25:15,604 --> 00:25:18,437
Are you experiencing any intense anxiety or worry?

308
00:25:18,645 --> 00:25:19,539
No.

309
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:23,837
It will go away when you get some rest.

310
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,630
It's not a disease.

311
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:28,483
Your body is in good health.

312
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:08,764
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting

313
00:26:09,217 --> 00:26:09,937
It must have been hot.

314
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:13,741
I should have given this to you.
What's this?

315
00:26:15,048 --> 00:26:17,575
I found this.
I'm curious.

316
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:18,422
Why?

317
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,321
I've been here for two hours now and I didn't even notice.

318
00:26:22,797 --> 00:26:24,004
It's like this fell from the stars.

319
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:27,028
It doesn't matter.

320
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:29,449
Throw it away.

321
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:32,128
How was it?

322
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:34,254
Doctor said no problem.

323
00:26:36,404 --> 00:26:37,697
I'm old.

324
00:26:37,944 --> 00:26:39,537
You're still young.

325
00:26:40,032 --> 00:26:43,779
But I look at my husband's face, and I think we're both getting older.

326
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:45,476
Let's not talk about your husband.

327
00:26:46,761 --> 00:26:49,581
It's an uncomfortable subject for me as well.
You're not the only one.

328
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:51,689
You're not the only one who's unconsciously talking about it?

329
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:58,433
It's my song.
Can't I sing this song?
It's my song.

330
00:26:59,031 --> 00:27:01,611
You want me to sing in the chorus too?
Do you want me to sing with you?

331
00:27:02,672 --> 00:27:03,359
No way.

332
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,739
It's a cowardly song that's all pride and no courage.

333
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:14,366
If you fight with your husband, I'll give you any advice you want.

334
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:18,403
I don't want to hear you complain without a fight.

335
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:24,499
What are you mad at me for?
What do you want from me?

336
00:27:25,952 --> 00:27:29,452
You're being selfish.
What right do you have to tell me what to do?

337
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,325
What's the hell about it.

338
00:27:33,812 --> 00:27:34,459
Have a seat.

339
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,190
It's too hot.

340
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:39,096
I'm leaving.

341
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:02,892
Ma'am.

342
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,996
Shall we visit him tonight?

343
00:28:06,697 --> 00:28:07,424
To where?

344
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:10,248
Machiko's apartment.

345
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,772
We'll find they are having sex.

346
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,393
It makes you to fight with him.

347
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,010
This is good idea.

348
00:28:22,344 --> 00:28:23,364
No way.

349
00:28:23,723 --> 00:28:24,210
Why not?

350
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,143
Because.

351
00:28:25,891 --> 00:28:29,438
Because if I see it, it's bound to be even worse than what I know from the letters on the paperwork.

352
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,072
You're a coward.

353
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:36,800
A kid like you wouldn't understand.

354
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,164
You're just too afraid to face reality.

355
00:28:43,256 --> 00:28:46,141
If it makes him upset,It will work.

356
00:28:47,015 --> 00:28:50,542
If I see the look on his face and he doesn't panic, It's all over.

357
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:52,735
That'd be fine.

358
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,514
Why can't I stay like this?

359
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:01,323
If I go like this, you won't be harmed.

360
00:29:02,214 --> 00:29:05,093
You're lying.
You can't go on like this.

361
00:29:05,884 --> 00:29:07,904
I can't tolerate lies that have nothing to do with me.

362
00:29:09,302 --> 00:29:12,016
Anyway, I can't stand this grotesque reality.

363
00:29:12,449 --> 00:29:14,042
I want to destroy this grotesque world.

364
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:18,841
Do you hate him or me?

365
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,012
Both.

366
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:25,184
It's Tuesday, isn't it?

367
00:29:27,024 --> 00:29:29,017
I'm sure he is visiting that woman.

368
00:30:47,465 --> 00:30:48,698
Why you are here?

369
00:31:22,275 --> 00:31:25,149
Koji.
You are here too.

370
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:28,159
How did you find here?

371
00:31:29,569 --> 00:31:32,115
I'm sure she appreciates you.

372
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:40,263
Just shut up and go home.

373
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:46,246
I think it's counterproductive to ask me to leave with that kind of attitude.

374
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:49,565
That's not so you.

375
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,588
I wouldn't be able to go home either.

376
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,734
It's a bad idea to bring things to a close at the last minute.

377
00:31:59,653 --> 00:32:02,073
We have to be concerned about her position.

378
00:32:03,627 --> 00:32:05,367
Go home with Koji first.

379
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,390
You're so terrible.

380
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:21,534
I have been holding back.

381
00:32:22,335 --> 00:32:24,182
I love you so much.

382
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:29,783
I believed in you.

383
00:32:32,414 --> 00:32:33,721
You're so terrible.

384
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:41,654
I've waited so long for your heart to come back to me

385
00:32:43,521 --> 00:32:45,475
I love you so much.

386
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,468
You're so terrible.

387
00:32:53,011 --> 00:32:55,538
Please leave now.

388
00:33:00,914 --> 00:33:03,027
Go home with me.

389
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:13,700
The saint said that man was born to suffer in this world

390
00:34:15,015 --> 00:34:20,755
He also said that man cannot live without making mistakes.

391
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:25,907
By mistakes, he did not mean that we make mistakes.

392
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:34,196
It means to hate others, to envy others, to bully others, to fight others.

393
00:34:34,747 --> 00:34:38,434
We all have greed.

394
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:43,137
This greed is always centered on oneself.

395
00:34:44,331 --> 00:34:51,424
Because you try to push your own greed, you will never find peace of mind.

396
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,852
Your underwriter's name is listed as Yuko Kusakado.

397
00:34:59,547 --> 00:35:02,380
This is the wife of the victim of your disability, is it not?

398
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:03,398
Yes.

399
00:35:04,026 --> 00:35:05,566
I've never heard of anything like this.

400
00:35:06,613 --> 00:35:11,133
The lady's letter says she wants to take you back because you committed the crime for her own good.

401
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:13,827
I guess it's called humanitarianism.

402
00:35:14,685 --> 00:35:15,998
The money has arrived.

403
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,420
Give me the note.

404
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:22,047
You will be taken in by the victim.

405
00:35:23,513 --> 00:35:26,440
You will never make a mistake again against the victim.

406
00:35:27,814 --> 00:35:31,947
If you're even a little nervous yourself, I'd be happy to consider changing underwriters.

407
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,946
Don't worry.

408
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,152
From now on, you will live a life of gratitude.

409
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:42,120
When the going gets tough, remember your life here and persevere.

410
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,603
You are never to come back here again.

411
00:35:47,983 --> 00:35:48,416
You swear?

412
00:35:49,170 --> 00:35:49,683
I swear.

413
00:37:04,261 --> 00:37:04,947
Please.

414
00:37:13,082 --> 00:37:14,042
Welcome back.

415
00:37:15,077 --> 00:37:16,350
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

416
00:37:17,396 --> 00:37:18,989
I've been waiting a long time for you.

417
00:37:20,379 --> 00:37:21,639
You look so nice.

418
00:37:22,174 --> 00:37:23,588
Thank you.

419
00:37:24,074 --> 00:37:25,267
I'm glad to see you're doing so well.

420
00:37:26,298 --> 00:37:28,384
You're looking better than ever.

421
00:37:29,206 --> 00:37:30,052
A villa?

422
00:37:30,946 --> 00:37:32,672
It's halfway up that mountainside.

423
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,320
I'd like to have a few words with you before we go.

424
00:37:35,893 --> 00:37:39,267
I know you do.
That's what I thought, so I brought you this.

425
00:37:40,539 --> 00:37:43,205
It's a village without a single coffee shop.

426
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:06,382
You don't care about your house?

427
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:08,563
About him?

428
00:38:09,482 --> 00:38:11,589
He's at home today. He's eating lunch alone.

429
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:13,498
That's better than meeting him out of the blue.

430
00:38:15,302 --> 00:38:17,529
Of course, he's very eager for you to come.

431
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:21,677
He's made himself at home like the Buddha.

432
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,482
There are no mirrors in prison.

433
00:38:27,365 --> 00:38:33,193
Of course I don't need one.
But when I'm getting close to getting out, suddenly I start to worry about my face.

434
00:38:34,763 --> 00:38:42,677
I worry about how I look to humans.
So, as an inmate nears release, he wants not only his number, but his face.

435
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:48,326
I had no choice but to put a dustpan outside the windowpane and use it as a mirror.

436
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:53,630
Look.
You've never changed.

437
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,068
There's not a shadow anywhere.

438
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:02,198
You haven't changed at all.

439
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:06,838
I'm sorry I never got to visit you.

440
00:39:07,721 --> 00:39:10,612
And the reason I gave in my letter, it's because it's true.

441
00:39:11,604 --> 00:39:15,705
He's too sick to be away from home overnight.

442
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:21,159
As you can see, he's in a state of flux without me.

443
00:39:21,854 --> 00:39:23,198
I'm sure you are satisfied.

444
00:39:25,235 --> 00:39:26,462
What do you mean by that?

445
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:29,743
I mean that he's not going to run away from me again.

446
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,806
That's the first thing you were going to say when you came out.

447
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,915
Oh, my God, that's such a horrible thing to say.

448
00:39:40,384 --> 00:39:42,704
If you said that, everything would be so screwed up.

449
00:39:46,337 --> 00:39:49,642
Promise me you won't say that, please.

450
00:39:51,339 --> 00:39:52,675
I didn't mean it like that.

451
00:40:05,441 --> 00:40:06,863
They're talking about us.

452
00:40:07,230 --> 00:40:08,949
I wonder how long we'll be rare.

453
00:40:16,861 --> 00:40:19,275
It's hot day,isn't?

454
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:34,511
You shouldn't walk around with your eyes down so low.

455
00:40:51,915 --> 00:40:52,907
Going out?

456
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:56,634
I'm just visiting my parishioners.
You always bring flowers, don't you?

457
00:40:57,337 --> 00:40:58,884
He is.

458
00:41:00,805 --> 00:41:01,813
Welcome back.

459
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:05,587
I'm glad to see you're doing well.

460
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:10,595
Come visit me when you get settled.

461
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:17,657
I've told that monk about you and everything.

462
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,376
He's a very nice man.
He's my confidant.

463
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,665
He immediately agreed to invite you.

464
00:41:25,251 --> 00:41:26,516
I don't like the monk much.

465
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:29,899
The churchwarden at the prison was a monk.
I didn't like him

466
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,962
Don't talk to me about prison.

467
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:47,207
Here... here...
There he is.

468
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,564
He's messy.

469
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:13,101
Clean your face.

470
00:42:14,047 --> 00:42:16,640
He's Koji.

471
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,261
Not Kori but Koji.

472
00:42:25,714 --> 00:42:27,175
Don't you remember him?

473
00:42:28,722 --> 00:42:30,487
Koji.

474
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:32,292
Hello.

475
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:36,206
That's strange.
He's been able to say it smoothly from the beginning.

476
00:42:39,011 --> 00:42:40,808
I'll show you around.

477
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:50,214
Now this greenhouse is where we do our business.

478
00:42:50,573 --> 00:42:53,855
Tokyo Gardening is doing business with us out of kindness for old time's sake.

479
00:42:54,347 --> 00:42:57,691
Actually, we'd like you to help us with this job.

480
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:01,823
That man is our helper SADA.

481
00:43:04,698 --> 00:43:06,847
It's not that the work is difficult.

482
00:43:07,175 --> 00:43:12,894
It's just the temperature control that's a little tricky.
But I think you're going to love it.

483
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:24,624
There are still a few.

484
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:28,585
These flowers.

485
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:31,242
Cymbidiums?

486
00:43:32,523 --> 00:43:34,835
You gave it to me when I first came to see you.

487
00:43:35,226 --> 00:43:37,453
I'm surprised you remember it.

488
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:43,601
Koji.

489
00:43:55,810 --> 00:43:58,630
I wonder if you drink water with relish.

490
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,372
Wanna drink?

491
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:32,672
okay?

492
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:38,242
Come on, let's go.

493
00:44:50,038 --> 00:44:51,913
I'll show you your room.

494
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:54,006
Your room is on the second floor.

495
00:44:54,225 --> 00:44:57,936
It's very well-ventilated, so you'll find it cooler than downstairs.
Please come.

496
00:45:05,187 --> 00:45:08,163
The wind from the ocean comes through best in this room.

497
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:14,929
I was going to get down on my knees and apologize to him, but I couldn't.

498
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:18,366
I really feel sorry for him.

499
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,304
It's over.

500
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:24,687
No, it's not.

501
00:45:24,937 --> 00:45:28,358
You've been paying for your sins for three years.

502
00:45:28,491 --> 00:45:29,663
That's another issue.

503
00:45:30,616 --> 00:45:33,327
Just because I've been socially punished doesn't mean I can apologize to him.

504
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:37,210
He is the one who should apologize to you.

505
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:38,390
No way.

506
00:45:40,966 --> 00:45:45,911
I must confess, I didn't think he was terribly different.

507
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:51,997
So the moment I saw him, I suddenly got choked up, and I forgot to say I was sorry.

508
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:53,989
It's called aphasia.

509
00:45:54,763 --> 00:45:58,185
He understands a lot of what we say.
He just can't speak.

510
00:45:58,802 --> 00:46:01,302
He's forgotten most of the words he speaks.

511
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:06,145
So it's normal for him to be frustrated, but he's so laid back.

512
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,239
Maybe he's more serious than that.

513
00:46:08,786 --> 00:46:10,364
But it's easy to communicate.

514
00:46:14,622 --> 00:46:15,677
Yuko.

515
00:46:31,584 --> 00:46:32,717
What kind of variety is this?

516
00:46:33,115 --> 00:46:35,420
It sells well as the Kannon flower.

517
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:37,600
You been in this business long?

518
00:46:37,904 --> 00:46:41,810
This wife taught me everything.
I used to be a fisherman.

519
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:43,545
You have wife?

520
00:46:43,904 --> 00:46:46,084
She ran away while I was in the army.

521
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:51,381
Even if you're like your husband here, you still have someone wonderful like his wife.

522
00:46:53,443 --> 00:46:54,178
Kids?

523
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:57,560
One daughter works at a music factory in Hamamatsu.

524
00:46:58,053 --> 00:46:59,904
She's a troubled girl

525
00:47:01,029 --> 00:47:01,529
What?

526
00:47:01,865 --> 00:47:04,982
Like her mother, she's play girl.

527
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,750
Hey, your tea is ready.

528
00:47:14,578 --> 00:47:16,414
Come on.

529
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:26,383
You getting used to the job?

530
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:27,563
Yeah.

531
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,954
We're going for a walk.

532
00:47:31,813 --> 00:47:33,110
How far do you go every day?

533
00:47:33,602 --> 00:47:38,571
There's the Kendo Post Office.
The postmaster's wife makes tea every day and waits for us.

534
00:47:39,234 --> 00:47:41,226
Sometimes I go to the harbor when I'm in the mood.

535
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:43,312
Let's go for a walk.

536
00:47:51,913 --> 00:47:53,343
We are off.

537
00:48:03,374 --> 00:48:04,593
Ko-chan.

538
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:09,905
Hold your stick.

539
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:12,264
You want me to come with you?

540
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:13,155
It's okay.

541
00:48:30,843 --> 00:48:33,249
She has a hard time.

542
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,239
Ko-chan.

543
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,801
I'm out of talcum powder, but there's some in the bedroom.

544
00:49:28,125 --> 00:49:31,672
Koji.
Don't worry. Come in.

545
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,883
Thank you very much.

546
00:49:41,141 --> 00:49:45,485
You're going to take a bath, right?
Then get in now, because you're wasting fuel.

547
00:49:49,305 --> 00:49:51,063
Don't be shy, go ahead.

548
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,781
You should close that door, so the wind doesn't blow through.

549
00:50:08,077 --> 00:50:12,132
I forgot... what happened to your college transcripts?

550
00:50:13,366 --> 00:50:14,577
I sent it out from jail.

551
00:50:14,952 --> 00:50:17,109
I'm sorry.

552
00:50:17,906 --> 00:50:20,609
Do you plan to work here for the rest of your life?

553
00:50:26,202 --> 00:50:28,015
Let's take a bath together.

554
00:50:28,374 --> 00:50:32,523
He's an idiot...
He wants to take a bath with me and you.

555
00:50:44,736 --> 00:50:48,025
I thought you just took a bath.

556
00:50:57,766 --> 00:50:58,711
Hey.

557
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:02,813
What's the hell?

558
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:06,610
Welcome.

559
00:51:07,750 --> 00:51:08,727
Oh Kimi.

560
00:51:08,977 --> 00:51:09,750
When did you come back?

561
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:12,493
I came back on the 4 o'clock boat.
I've been on vacation for a week.

562
00:51:13,915 --> 00:51:15,657
You're growing up again.

563
00:51:17,008 --> 00:51:18,305
Have a drink.

564
00:51:19,383 --> 00:51:22,282
I got a bonus so let's have fun together.

565
00:51:22,469 --> 00:51:24,360
Give us a lot of beers.

566
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:31,321
I'd like to make a toast to you.

567
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:32,400
Who's him?

568
00:51:33,087 --> 00:51:34,337
I don't know.

569
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:35,462
No?

570
00:51:36,751 --> 00:51:38,626
He's just poor boy.

571
00:51:48,967 --> 00:51:50,811
Do you work at Kusagado Greenhouse?

572
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:53,335
My dad works there.

573
00:51:53,897 --> 00:51:54,749
You are Sada's daughter?

574
00:51:54,975 --> 00:51:56,600
Yes, I'm Kimi.

575
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:59,272
Let's drink with us.

576
00:52:23,115 --> 00:52:26,005
You have to put it in my mouth.

577
00:52:33,104 --> 00:52:35,276
Don't mess Up Your Mouth.

578
00:52:47,875 --> 00:52:51,969
Ko-chan!
I want you to accompany me on my walk today.

579
00:52:53,281 --> 00:52:54,922
I don't feel comfortable on my own.

580
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:58,703
The three of us are going on a picnic to Otaki today.

581
00:53:01,156 --> 00:53:02,375
It's far.

582
00:53:02,703 --> 00:53:04,141
I think we have about half a day.

583
00:53:06,344 --> 00:53:07,040
Can you walk?

584
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:09,321
I can walk.

585
00:53:11,266 --> 00:53:15,758
We'll have to be adventurous.
The only thing to see in this village is Otaki Falls.

586
00:53:17,532 --> 00:53:21,235
I know.
Otaki, it's a big waterfall.

587
00:53:23,626 --> 00:53:25,610
Not Ogaki, Otaki.

588
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,617
You are stupid.

589
00:54:16,391 --> 00:54:19,570
Let's take a picture of the three of us together.

590
00:54:21,313 --> 00:54:22,484
three of us?

591
00:54:23,102 --> 00:54:24,492
With Otaki in the background.

592
00:54:46,888 --> 00:54:48,786
I'm in the middle.

593
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,106
How I wish we could stand side by side like this at the grave.

594
00:54:54,544 --> 00:54:56,630
I don't want to stay with you in heaven either.

595
00:55:04,841 --> 00:55:09,786
Do you know who in the world out of the three is sacrificing the most?

596
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:18,677
Do you know what sacrifice is?

597
00:55:22,015 --> 00:55:24,250
No, sacrifice is a word.

598
00:55:24,812 --> 00:55:26,492
It's such an abstract word.

599
00:55:26,517 --> 00:55:28,367
We're doing a test right now.

600
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,078
Do you know what sacrifice is?

601
00:55:32,915 --> 00:55:34,064
You are stupid.

602
00:55:36,321 --> 00:55:37,751
This.

603
00:55:55,363 --> 00:55:56,964
Do you know what kiss is?

604
00:55:59,152 --> 00:56:01,933
Say kiss.

605
00:56:03,574 --> 00:56:05,003
Don't you understand?

606
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,855
I'll tell you.
It's like this.

607
00:56:13,696 --> 00:56:14,689
Stop it....

608
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:16,407
Don't make him suffer.

609
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,595
I don't.

610
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:20,861
I don't want to be your tool.

611
00:56:20,954 --> 00:56:24,611
You've been a tool from the start.
You like me,right.

612
00:56:31,829 --> 00:56:33,400
Why do you laugh?

613
00:56:34,488 --> 00:56:35,980
Stop laughing.

614
00:56:36,005 --> 00:56:38,660
He has a face like this.

615
00:56:38,824 --> 00:56:40,847
He's laughing.

616
00:56:41,308 --> 00:56:41,902
I'm leaving.

617
00:56:41,927 --> 00:56:42,550
Why?

618
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:45,183
I can't keep your company any longer.

619
00:56:45,574 --> 00:56:48,199
You are after all the same kind of people as this man.

620
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:50,379
All you care about is your own well-being.

621
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,519
You think I'm a slave.

622
00:56:52,644 --> 00:56:55,754
You think of yourself as a victim.
It's ridiculous.

623
00:56:57,441 --> 00:56:58,987
Hold on.

624
00:57:06,675 --> 00:57:07,620
Ko-chan.

625
00:57:19,391 --> 00:57:19,750
Hi.

626
00:57:20,157 --> 00:57:21,415
I've been waiting for you.

627
00:57:22,719 --> 00:57:25,336
We're all going swimming in Urayasu.
Wanna come?

628
00:57:25,977 --> 00:57:26,516
Sea...

629
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:29,180
My dad is coming.
See you.

630
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:34,061
Welcome.

631
00:57:34,171 --> 00:57:34,491
Yes.

632
00:57:34,671 --> 00:57:35,280
Where's master?

633
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:36,640
He'll come back soon.

634
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:38,921
Did my daughter say something to you?

635
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:39,788
No.

636
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,397
She's nice.

637
00:57:43,562 --> 00:57:45,882
She's always playing.

638
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:47,257
No way.

639
00:57:58,965 --> 00:58:01,020
Anyone want this ukulele?

640
00:58:01,112 --> 00:58:02,705
I want.

641
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:05,812
This is my treasure.

642
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:09,346
I want to give it to someone who I love.

643
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:10,409
Really?

644
00:58:10,482 --> 00:58:10,982
Yeah.

645
00:58:11,195 --> 00:58:14,769
The person who gets it that wants you for themselves.

646
00:58:14,794 --> 00:58:15,169
Yeah.

647
00:58:15,194 --> 00:58:15,762
Really?

648
00:58:16,365 --> 00:58:16,919
You swear?

649
00:58:18,285 --> 00:58:18,845
Yes.

650
00:58:20,603 --> 00:58:21,443
I'll get it.

651
00:58:21,503 --> 00:58:22,456
I'll get it.

652
00:58:23,149 --> 00:58:24,489
I'll get it.

653
00:58:24,729 --> 00:58:26,083
Stop it.

654
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:28,526
Stupid.

655
00:58:28,592 --> 00:58:31,019
I don't want to give you my body.

656
00:58:31,559 --> 00:58:32,932
Let's go.

657
00:58:36,495 --> 00:58:38,169
Hold on.

658
00:58:39,764 --> 00:58:41,150
You want me to give you the ukulele?

659
00:58:41,424 --> 00:58:43,977
I'll be waiting for you in the pines over there tonight around 7:00.

660
00:59:01,819 --> 00:59:05,592
I hear you are virgin.

661
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:07,352
Yes.

662
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,716
You're pure boy.

663
00:59:10,275 --> 00:59:11,235
You think so?

664
00:59:11,675 --> 00:59:13,595
I mean, it's so rare these days.

665
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,353
I've been exposed to all kinds of dirty relations between men and women since I was a little boy.

666
00:59:22,622 --> 00:59:26,728
My father brought his Mistress to live in the same house with my mother.

667
00:59:27,219 --> 00:59:28,286
He was crazy.

668
00:59:29,361 --> 00:59:30,627
He was like an animal.

669
00:59:31,646 --> 00:59:33,033
I was so frustrated.

670
00:59:33,424 --> 00:59:36,417
All men are animals.
You're too.

671
00:59:36,561 --> 00:59:37,421
I'm not.

672
00:59:37,581 --> 00:59:38,528
How are you different?

673
00:59:39,502 --> 00:59:41,122
I'm at least a human being.

674
00:59:41,268 --> 00:59:43,435
That's because everyone thinks they're human.

675
00:59:44,351 --> 00:59:47,791
It's just that humans have a sense of sin, but beasts don't.

676
00:59:47,985 --> 00:59:49,911
I don't know if it's that hard to understand.

677
00:59:51,608 --> 00:59:52,755
Do you like me?

678
00:59:54,675 --> 00:59:55,935
You know I do.

679
00:59:58,052 --> 00:59:59,086
Do you?

680
01:00:02,388 --> 01:00:02,968
I like you.

681
01:00:03,188 --> 01:00:03,841
Liar.

682
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:04,895
I'm not lying.

683
01:00:05,596 --> 01:00:07,543
You like the wife at the green house.

684
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,243
I know.

685
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:10,688
I hate her.

686
01:00:10,743 --> 01:00:13,257
I know you lover her so much.

687
01:00:13,897 --> 01:00:15,403
But I don't care.

688
01:00:16,189 --> 01:00:17,769
It's not my business.

689
01:00:39,809 --> 01:00:41,062
Hello?

690
01:00:42,149 --> 01:00:42,702
Hi.

691
01:00:42,922 --> 01:00:44,556
It's hot, isn't it?

692
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:46,326
Come in.

693
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:48,417
You don't feel hot?

694
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,513
You're drooling.

695
01:00:57,956 --> 01:01:00,576
I hear you were play boy before.

696
01:01:01,389 --> 01:01:03,449
I heard you were very popular with the girls.

697
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:07,739
Welcome.
Don't make fun of him.

698
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:10,183
I'm leaving today.

699
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:11,570
Did you see your dad?

700
01:01:11,595 --> 01:01:12,165
No.

701
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:13,556
He is in green house.

702
01:01:13,609 --> 01:01:14,996
I don't wanna see him.

703
01:01:15,144 --> 01:01:15,991
Why?

704
01:01:17,303 --> 01:01:19,056
Is Koji here?

705
01:01:19,329 --> 01:01:21,016
He's gone to the temple.

706
01:01:22,968 --> 01:01:24,195
What do you want?

707
01:01:39,444 --> 01:01:40,284
Kochan.

708
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,697
Fumi is here to say good bye.

709
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:48,921
I asked her to have lunch together but she had no time.

710
01:01:58,295 --> 01:01:59,455
I'll give you this.

711
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:05,353
I told you.
I only give this to a person who I love.

712
01:02:07,234 --> 01:02:10,927
Take care of this.
This is my soul.

713
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:37,451
Take a bath.
You smell bad.

714
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,174
Don't get out.

715
01:03:56,655 --> 01:03:57,835
Don't get out.

716
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:07,177
Stay here.

717
01:04:14,258 --> 01:04:15,991
You know why I'm here?

718
01:04:17,392 --> 01:04:20,445
I put a pin in her hand.

719
01:04:21,659 --> 01:04:24,586
I can't stop thinking about that look on your face afterwards.

720
01:04:27,353 --> 01:04:30,100
You thought I was jealous of you, didn't you?

721
01:04:32,183 --> 01:04:33,157
Don't get me wrong.

722
01:04:34,327 --> 01:04:38,407
I didn't get jealous.
I just hate such a rude girl.

723
01:04:39,172 --> 01:04:41,012
I use a pin to stick.

724
01:04:42,766 --> 01:04:44,053
Just like you used spanner.

725
01:04:46,017 --> 01:04:48,551
Don't talk about that.

726
01:04:49,370 --> 01:04:50,870
I've changed my mind now.

727
01:04:51,514 --> 01:04:52,554
Same here.

728
01:04:52,947 --> 01:04:54,960
You don't have to.

729
01:04:56,336 --> 01:05:00,510
I put on sin so you wouldn't have to do anything you regret.

730
01:05:01,213 --> 01:05:04,067
You put on sin?
What's the hell?

731
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,603
I didn't ask for any of that.

732
01:05:07,176 --> 01:05:10,110
You're just being selfish.

733
01:05:11,082 --> 01:05:12,202
What's the matter with you?

734
01:05:13,989 --> 01:05:16,649
You think you're the only one who can take the blame.

735
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:19,302
You should have gone to jail, too?

736
01:05:19,844 --> 01:05:21,724
Are you trying to atone for your sins with me?

737
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:23,585
It's impossible.

738
01:05:24,193 --> 01:05:27,013
You can't hold back about the life in a jail.

739
01:05:28,992 --> 01:05:30,885
I envy you.

740
01:05:32,112 --> 01:05:34,485
You've paid for your sins.

741
01:05:35,791 --> 01:05:37,457
I don't know what to do.

742
01:05:39,365 --> 01:05:44,225
I want to die thinking that I will never stop feeling like this.

743
01:05:46,857 --> 01:05:48,590
There's no reason for you to die.

744
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,870
You're just trying to make a living taking care of that man.

745
01:05:54,117 --> 01:05:58,177
You don't understand anything, do you?

746
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:05,164
Come in.

747
01:06:08,568 --> 01:06:09,855
It can't be helped.

748
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,464
I'm not good.

749
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:15,079
Come in.

750
01:06:20,257 --> 01:06:21,817
You smell like black man.

751
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:23,824
You hate it?

752
01:06:24,531 --> 01:06:25,464
I like it.

753
01:07:10,773 --> 01:07:11,099
What's wrong.

754
01:07:11,246 --> 01:07:11,773
Let me come in.

755
01:07:11,806 --> 01:07:12,573
You can't.

756
01:07:12,615 --> 01:07:15,128
You told me cum in.
You care about him?

757
01:07:15,828 --> 01:07:17,201
We can't do this.

758
01:07:19,342 --> 01:07:20,243
You are coward.

759
01:07:38,796 --> 01:07:39,982
Yuko?

760
01:07:42,856 --> 01:07:43,582
I'm here.

761
01:07:45,503 --> 01:07:46,956
Yuko?

762
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:48,356
What's the matter with you?

763
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:52,959
Cold...

764
01:07:53,459 --> 01:07:56,126
Cold.. it's cool.

765
01:07:58,801 --> 01:08:00,941
Cool.

766
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:08,560
I wanna sleep here.

767
01:08:12,007 --> 01:08:13,261
It's cool.

768
01:08:14,782 --> 01:08:17,342
I want to sleep here.

769
01:08:18,254 --> 01:08:19,854
Want to sleep here?

770
01:08:20,538 --> 01:08:22,165
Shall I lay out the bedding?

771
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:26,602
I want to sleep here.

772
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:01,349
Here you go.

773
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:53,099
For Tokyo Gardening,
Kannon Bamboo is 68

774
01:09:54,307 --> 01:09:55,727
Ananas rosea 68

775
01:09:56,469 --> 01:09:59,802
Gomu décoras is 1,2,3,4...

776
01:10:00,175 --> 01:10:00,815
Kochan.

777
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:04,578
Please deliver these to the temple again.

778
01:10:05,196 --> 01:10:06,856
I'll take care of it.

779
01:10:09,694 --> 01:10:10,700
Gomu décoras is?

780
01:10:10,774 --> 01:10:11,307
6

781
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:21,561
It's always hot.

782
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:22,728
Thank you.

783
01:10:24,489 --> 01:10:27,002
They are sleeping together.

784
01:10:27,529 --> 01:10:28,922
In one room?

785
01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:31,623
Her husband is crazy.

786
01:10:34,535 --> 01:10:35,335
Really?

787
01:10:51,519 --> 01:10:52,179
Hello.

788
01:10:54,764 --> 01:10:56,710
I'm sorry about all this.

789
01:10:57,738 --> 01:11:01,111
I've been meaning to have a long talk with you.

790
01:11:01,935 --> 01:11:03,442
If you're not busy, why don't you come by?

791
01:11:04,462 --> 01:11:05,595
I'll make some tea.

792
01:11:16,071 --> 01:11:18,704
You must have a lot on your mind.

793
01:11:20,761 --> 01:11:22,981
If you have a problem, it's better to say it

794
01:11:24,067 --> 01:11:26,960
The soul is shy.

795
01:11:27,248 --> 01:11:29,955
It huddles in the dark and hates the sunlight.

796
01:11:30,403 --> 01:11:32,563
They're like perishable sea urchins.

797
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:37,625
Let me tell you something.

798
01:11:39,633 --> 01:11:43,306
You're troubled by Lady Yuko, aren't you?

799
01:11:44,572 --> 01:11:45,165
I know.

800
01:11:46,536 --> 01:11:49,382
It can't be helped.

801
01:11:49,946 --> 01:11:52,759
Everyone in the village is blaming you and her.

802
01:11:53,784 --> 01:12:00,592
Some of them are even talking about the ugly baby she's going to give birth to.

803
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:04,299
But don't worry about that.

804
01:12:05,599 --> 01:12:07,359
Let those who want to say it.

805
01:12:08,935 --> 01:12:13,995
You're more troubled by the voice of your own conscience than by the accusations of others.

806
01:12:14,754 --> 01:12:15,274
Of course you are.

807
01:12:16,021 --> 01:12:17,241
But it's noble.

808
01:12:18,143 --> 01:12:20,256
It proves you have a conscience.

809
01:12:20,964 --> 01:12:23,071
That's why they call it "suffering equals bodhi".

810
01:12:23,868 --> 01:12:27,141
I've heard that story a lot from a church priest in prison.

811
01:12:30,685 --> 01:12:31,778
Then let me ask you.

812
01:12:32,814 --> 01:12:34,927
Do you want to be an animal?

813
01:12:36,129 --> 01:12:38,316
Or do you want to live like a human being?

814
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:40,486
I think I'm human.

815
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:43,210
Yeah.

816
01:12:44,407 --> 01:12:47,307
If you don't want to be an animal, you'll have to leave this village.

817
01:12:49,591 --> 01:12:50,871
You can do it.

818
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:18,506
Kochan.

819
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:39,993
Can't you sleep?

820
01:14:33,004 --> 01:14:35,470
Mr. Sada, how do you know a typhoon is coming?

821
01:14:36,004 --> 01:14:37,537
I can tell from the birdsong.

822
01:14:38,061 --> 01:14:39,094
You can tell from the birdsong?

823
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,060
I've heard stories about predicting the weather from the morning grill.
I've never heard of bird calls.

824
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:48,327
I can tell from the starlight.

825
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:51,300
Because I was fisherman.

826
01:15:00,691 --> 01:15:01,417
Kochan.

827
01:15:09,322 --> 01:15:12,788
It must be hard for you.
Your husband is crippled.

828
01:15:12,813 --> 01:15:14,181
I'm used to it.

829
01:15:14,674 --> 01:15:17,067
Your business..Sada and...

830
01:15:17,214 --> 01:15:18,827
Koji works hard.

831
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,934
I hear he's nice.

832
01:15:22,637 --> 01:15:24,823
I envy you.

833
01:15:25,257 --> 01:15:27,557
We all talk about you.

834
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,287
The monk is worried about you.

835
01:15:32,053 --> 01:15:34,166
He worries if you don't hear anything bad

836
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:40,294
She's here to watch our flowers.

837
01:15:40,767 --> 01:15:42,947
I'm too busy.
Bring him to take a walk today.

838
01:15:43,137 --> 01:15:46,437
Don't worry.
I will come again.

839
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,470
He's used to it.

840
01:16:01,249 --> 01:16:02,389
Put him shoes on.

841
01:16:25,959 --> 01:16:26,825
Take care.

842
01:16:43,559 --> 01:16:45,359
It's hot,isn't it?

843
01:17:26,202 --> 01:17:29,349
I don't understand you.

844
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:33,249
Why do you keep smiling like that and tormenting me and your wife?

845
01:17:36,915 --> 01:17:37,929
You hate me,right?

846
01:17:38,700 --> 01:17:40,326
Why don't you just say it out loud?

847
01:17:41,195 --> 01:17:44,808
You're willing to say what's convenient, but when it's inconvenient, you blame it on your illness and keep it deliberately vague.

848
01:17:45,628 --> 01:17:46,581
Right?

849
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,371
You's making fun of me.

850
01:17:52,184 --> 01:17:53,998
 I've never seen anyone as obnoxious as you.

851
01:18:03,659 --> 01:18:06,845
You don't even want to look at me. You think I'm unforgivable, don't you?

852
01:18:07,826 --> 01:18:09,066
Right?

853
01:18:13,062 --> 01:18:13,816
Hot.

854
01:18:15,802 --> 01:18:16,696
Hot?

855
01:18:17,482 --> 01:18:18,196
It's hot.

856
01:18:19,846 --> 01:18:21,766
You're playing a monster.

857
01:18:22,547 --> 01:18:24,827
You're acting very well.

858
01:18:25,435 --> 01:18:28,408
But you know what, I'm gonna peel that monster face off your face.

859
01:18:29,863 --> 01:18:31,482
I'm getting understanding.

860
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:35,842
Your death won't bring me and your wife together.
And as long as you're here, she and I will never be together.

861
01:18:36,525 --> 01:18:39,039
It's your conspiracy to create this weird environment.

862
01:18:40,235 --> 01:18:43,022
We can no longer kiss without guilt.

863
01:18:43,769 --> 01:18:45,756
That guilt turns the taste of a kiss to ash.

864
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,816
You set us up so we'd be guilt-bound about everything.

865
01:18:49,397 --> 01:18:52,250
That's what you wanted for so long.
Revenge on us.

866
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,797
Right?

867
01:18:57,213 --> 01:18:58,705
Hey listen!

868
01:18:59,525 --> 01:19:02,330
You don't have to look so serious.

869
01:19:03,588 --> 01:19:06,463
The truth is, you're happy with how you are.

870
01:19:07,205 --> 01:19:12,775
You're having a wonderful vacation, continuing the glamorous life of the past and the womanizing that has gone out of control.

871
01:19:13,564 --> 01:19:15,705
You enjoy laughing at our suffering.

872
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:18,033
That's the laughing.

873
01:19:19,158 --> 01:19:23,220
You're trying to drag us all down into a big, dark hole with your laugh.

874
01:19:34,713 --> 01:19:36,095
What do you hate about me?

875
01:19:36,947 --> 01:19:39,408
Tell me.

876
01:19:41,134 --> 01:19:43,470
It's my fault I picked up a wrench in the hospital yard?

877
01:19:44,486 --> 01:19:46,775
I thought you left that there beforehand.

878
01:19:48,901 --> 01:19:53,597
Your plan was nearing completion when you moved into the bedroom next to mine.

879
01:19:55,097 --> 01:19:57,151
Me and your wife sleeping together in front of you.

880
01:19:57,862 --> 01:20:02,706
If I have sex with her in front of you, that's what you want.

881
01:20:03,511 --> 01:20:07,745
But I can't do that.
I don't want to become the beast you want me to be.

882
01:20:09,566 --> 01:20:13,776
She was about to be the beast but she couldn't.

883
01:20:15,651 --> 01:20:19,745
You knew this and seduced us.

884
01:20:20,831 --> 01:20:22,542
You knew there was nowhere to run, and you hunted us down.

885
01:20:23,753 --> 01:20:25,995
That's what makes this so much fun for you, isn't it?

886
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:29,878
I’m better than you.

887
01:20:30,878 --> 01:20:35,550
I go to catch the prey, but you just wait for the prey to be hooked.

888
01:20:37,745 --> 01:20:39,066
What do you want?

889
01:20:40,323 --> 01:20:42,808
What do you really want?

890
01:20:44,003 --> 01:20:45,581
Go home.

891
01:20:45,683 --> 01:20:46,589
Go home?

892
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:52,542
I know, I know.
But first, you're gonna tell me the truth.
Until then, I'm not letting you leave.

893
01:20:59,147 --> 01:21:00,296
I wanna die.

894
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:05,319
You wanna die?

895
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,090
What should I do?

896
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:21,786
Tell me.

897
01:22:14,403 --> 01:22:17,270
Ko-chan.
I hope the greenhouse is okay.

898
01:22:38,104 --> 01:22:40,838
I wanna die.

899
01:22:54,288 --> 01:22:55,460
He's sleepwalking.

900
01:22:57,992 --> 01:23:02,859
Ko-chan.
He says he wants to die.

901
01:23:08,452 --> 01:23:10,186
I feel like I'm in a cave.

902
01:23:12,436 --> 01:23:15,866
It's like we're trapped in a cave with no way out.

903
01:23:20,069 --> 01:23:23,233
It was a mistake for me to come here.

904
01:23:26,241 --> 01:23:26,858
Why?

905
01:23:28,882 --> 01:23:30,092
No, you don't.

906
01:23:32,968 --> 01:23:36,991
You're holding him in your arms, and you're asking me out.

907
01:23:39,046 --> 01:23:41,249
Don't talk to me like that.

908
01:23:42,327 --> 01:23:45,764
I was just worried about you getting out of jail.

909
01:23:47,561 --> 01:23:49,218
I've had enough of those excuses.

910
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:53,710
You've had your fun in this weird life.

911
01:23:54,210 --> 01:23:57,069
You have no intention of leaving him and escaping this darkness.

912
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:02,718
Besides, I'm sure he'd love to see us embrace in front of his own eyes.

913
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:19,066
I can't take it anymore.
I have to get out of here.

914
01:24:24,601 --> 01:24:29,804
I don't want to turn into a beast and chase you around.

915
01:24:46,635 --> 01:24:51,455
Are you leaving without me, Ko-chan?

916
01:24:52,924 --> 01:24:54,901
Tell me.

917
01:24:55,807 --> 01:24:57,471
Are you leaving without me?

918
01:25:01,859 --> 01:25:03,695
Don't you love me?

919
01:25:05,632 --> 01:25:08,828
We love each other.

920
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:10,289
Was that a lie?

921
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:13,265
You didn't love me.

922
01:25:17,994 --> 01:25:23,103
If you love me, please don't leave this house.

923
01:25:23,549 --> 01:25:26,580
I can't live without you.

924
01:25:27,510 --> 01:25:29,174
Stay like this.

925
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:32,432
Isn't it bad?

926
01:25:32,697 --> 01:25:37,307
If I stay here, I have no choice but to die myself or kill him.

927
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:38,838
Don't say that.

928
01:25:40,275 --> 01:25:42,393
Please.

929
01:26:33,956 --> 01:26:36,323
what are you going to do?

930
01:26:37,268 --> 01:26:39,229
I will make his wish come true.

931
01:27:17,159 --> 01:27:21,168
I ended up giving that guy what he wanted.

932
01:27:22,394 --> 01:27:28,699
Oh yeah,
He expected me to be sentenced to death.

933
01:28:11,235 --> 01:28:13,275
Thank you for coming all the way from far away.

934
01:28:13,782 --> 01:28:17,556
I am KIBE, a church worker at Sendai Prison.

935
01:28:17,853 --> 01:28:19,954
I've been expecting you.

936
01:28:29,819 --> 01:28:32,061
The bones of Koji Umemiya.

937
01:28:33,139 --> 01:28:40,350
He had no relatives, so it is a blessing that you have taken him in.

938
01:28:40,803 --> 01:28:43,116
He was a poor young man.

939
01:28:43,748 --> 01:28:46,428
I hear you've already built a grave for him.

940
01:28:46,724 --> 01:28:47,194
Yes.

941
01:28:49,155 --> 01:28:53,194
That's because Yuko asked me to do so.

942
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:03,334
Is Yuko the girlfriend who received a life sentence?

943
01:29:03,483 --> 01:29:04,186
Yes.

944
01:29:04,694 --> 01:29:05,608
Have you met her?

945
01:29:05,818 --> 01:29:09,927
The girls are in prison in Tochigi.

946
01:29:10,045 --> 01:29:11,069
So I haven't.

947
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:12,709
I see.

948
01:29:15,530 --> 01:29:21,803
The morning after the typhoon, I was tidying up the garden.

949
01:29:29,256 --> 01:29:32,311
It was a terrible storm.

950
01:29:33,655 --> 01:29:35,694
Your greenhouse was safe?

951
01:29:36,936 --> 01:29:38,366
No, sir. We didn't sustain any damage.

952
01:29:38,483 --> 01:29:39,577
That's good to hear.

953
01:29:40,655 --> 01:29:42,264
Are we going out together?

954
01:29:44,802 --> 01:29:46,505
My husband died last night.

955
01:29:47,154 --> 01:29:48,716
Really?

956
01:29:50,029 --> 01:29:52,880
I killed him.

957
01:29:56,349 --> 01:30:01,341
You told me that if I didn't want to become a monster, I had to leave this village.

958
01:30:03,732 --> 01:30:07,646
But I finally couldn't leave.

959
01:30:09,599 --> 01:30:13,419
And I had no choice.

960
01:30:15,122 --> 01:30:16,911
I hope you understand.

961
01:30:17,951 --> 01:30:20,935
I just want you to understand

962
01:30:24,048 --> 01:30:26,345
We're going to the police now.

963
01:30:28,111 --> 01:30:31,165
We wanted to ask you to come with us.

964
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:39,275
When this young man was sentenced to death, Mrs. Yuko received a letter from the prison.

965
01:30:39,884 --> 01:30:45,220
She asked me to erect our three graves side by side.

966
01:30:45,993 --> 01:30:51,072
She wants to build her grave as a counterfeit while she lives.

967
01:30:51,376 --> 01:30:52,275
Yes.

968
01:30:54,118 --> 01:30:57,572
The villagers were very much against it.

969
01:30:58,892 --> 01:31:02,548
The graves of the deceased husband and wife would be enough.

970
01:31:03,298 --> 01:31:09,900
They say it would defile the cemetery to put up the grave of that young man who was guilty of murder.

971
01:31:16,163 --> 01:31:24,428
She sent me this photo asking for a grave to be built like this photo.

972
01:31:26,402 --> 01:31:30,176
Because of how pathetic her wish seemed

973
01:31:31,590 --> 01:31:38,629
When the young man was executed, I had the three of them built graves.

974
01:31:39,269 --> 01:31:44,988
As a matter of fact, Umemiya had asked me to do something about the graves before her execution.

975
01:31:46,043 --> 01:31:50,996
He knew that she wished to have their graves built.

976
01:31:51,965 --> 01:31:55,152
He asked that his grave never be built.

977
01:31:55,957 --> 01:32:01,097
I beg you not to place the three graves side by side.

978
01:32:02,277 --> 01:32:06,168
Please throw my bones into the Izu Sea.

979
01:32:07,433 --> 01:32:11,035
I ask you to smash them to pieces and scatter them in the currents of the sea.

980
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:20,379
Umemiya didn't want to expose the traces of his cursed life to people's eyes.

981
01:32:20,637 --> 01:32:27,449
The idea of losing his remains to the sea is very typical of him.

982
01:32:27,504 --> 01:32:33,949
I was also troubled by it, since it was said by a man who is now trying to become a Buddha.

983
01:32:33,974 --> 01:32:38,457
I listened to him as he was, thinking that there was no need to disturb Umemiya's mind at this point.

984
01:32:39,090 --> 01:32:44,308
I was actually relieved when you were able to build his grave here.

985
01:32:45,387 --> 01:32:49,137
At least the Buddha cannot be happy without a grave.

986
01:32:49,324 --> 01:32:52,066
Thank you for all your hard work.

987
01:32:53,363 --> 01:32:54,324
That's it.

988
01:33:04,280 --> 01:33:06,210
Grass management is difficult.

989
01:33:07,202 --> 01:33:09,741
These are magnificent graves.

990
01:33:27,460 --> 01:33:30,835
Now the young man can go to heaven in peace.

991
01:33:31,780 --> 01:33:32,874
I will worship him.

992
01:33:33,038 --> 01:33:33,811
Please.

993
01:33:56,737 --> 01:34:07,799
THE END

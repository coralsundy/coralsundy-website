2
00:01:20,067 --> 00:01:24,294
Are you alright,Nogami?

3
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:25,709
Are you alright?

4
00:01:26,679 --> 00:01:29,866
Every time a bullet train passes by, her pulse races.

5
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:32,543
190 per min

6
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,749
B29..B29

7
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,756
What's the hell about B29?

8
00:01:44,059 --> 00:01:45,779
It's an old American bomber.

9
00:01:46,998 --> 00:01:51,292
In the last war, they rained bombs down and bombed the hell out of this neighborhood.

10
00:01:51,706 --> 00:01:52,713
So her

11
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:58,305
She remembered that 30 years ago again on the bullet train.

12
00:02:00,934 --> 00:02:03,948
Go back to the hospital, the pharmacy's probably busy.

13
00:02:04,762 --> 00:02:08,002
You're treating her like a parent.

14
00:02:09,522 --> 00:02:13,528
My family didn't want to take the bullet train, so they ran away.

15
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,034
I won't let her die alone.

16
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:21,655
If you're here, I'm here.

17
00:02:31,327 --> 00:02:32,507
Stay strong

18
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,377
Does the JNR president think we, the plaintiffs in the Shinkansen pollution lawsuit, are stupid?

19
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:54,913
We've been to court 10 times and you haven't shown any sincerity!

20
00:02:56,654 --> 00:03:00,788
A Shinkansen is 60 tons per car, 960 tons in gravity.

21
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:04,035
This thing breaks through every 5 minutes at 200km/h.

22
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,314
Do you know how much noise and vibration that makes?

23
00:03:09,062 --> 00:03:12,942
I understand your suffering, sir.

24
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:18,660
We will build a soundproof wall to slow down the speed in the city.

25
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,461
We will also put up a joint antenna for television.

26
00:03:22,792 --> 00:03:27,179
We are doing our best, sir.

27
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:29,963
That soundproof wall won't work

28
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:34,083
The cup on my desk is shaking.
How can a human being live here?

29
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:42,336
We have paid 100,000 yen per person as a primary guarantee to those within 50 meters of the line.

30
00:03:43,257 --> 00:03:44,117
We continue..

31
00:03:44,315 --> 00:03:45,715
That's not enough

32
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,892
Give us 1 million

33
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,087
Babies along the line cry all day long for the bullet train.

34
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:56,241
Some of them died because they couldn't have a milk

35
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:57,961
Seven adults died, too.

36
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:00,762
What are you going to do?

37
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:04,512
Say something

38
00:04:07,543 --> 00:04:13,190
If You're going to use your power to crush the trial.
I'll take a stick of dynamite and jump onto the bullet train.

39
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:33,097
Nogami

40
00:04:40,684 --> 00:04:43,237
She died

41
00:05:04,274 --> 00:05:07,634
She died finally

42
00:05:11,726 --> 00:05:17,566
She just got well after being in the hospital.

43
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:24,490
Why didn't you answer?

44
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,040
You're strange these days

45
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,406
You've gone completely quiet.

46
00:05:37,126 --> 00:05:40,493
You're always off at the hospital, always off somewhere.

47
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,004
What the hell are you doing?

48
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:54,061
 I need you to steal 15 CCs of nitroglycerin from the hospital pharmacy.

49
00:05:56,287 --> 00:06:00,453
That is a deleterious drug. It's heavily controlled.

50
00:06:01,644 --> 00:06:02,870
So I'm asking you

51
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,173
pharmacist can handle it.

52
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:09,124
What for?

53
00:06:09,718 --> 00:06:10,424
Don't worry

54
00:06:11,847 --> 00:06:12,760
Trust me

55
00:06:17,155 --> 00:06:19,795
If you don't like it, I'll steal it.

56
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:22,068
OK

57
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:56,424
I'm painful

58
00:07:01,685 --> 00:07:02,638
Blood pressure

59
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:14,135
What's the name of the disease?

60
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:16,393
Heart failure due to hardening of the arteries.

61
00:07:18,046 --> 00:07:20,986
The patient's address is listed as ATSUTA 2, Nagoya City

62
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,497
What do you mean?

63
00:07:26,198 --> 00:07:32,097
Noise and vibration from the Shinkansen are particularly bad here.

64
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:37,720
Isn't this heart disease also caused by Shinkansen pollution?

65
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:41,551
You always blame pollution.

66
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,500
Next

67
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,877
You need to go right down that hallway.

68
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:57,068
Excuse me

69
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,787
I'm off to Europe

70
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:04,827
Europe?

71
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:07,484
Only for 3 months.

72
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:09,304
Since when ?

73
00:08:09,924 --> 00:08:10,457
Tomorrow

74
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,130
Tomorrow?

75
00:08:13,729 --> 00:08:14,576
What are you doing there?

76
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:16,429
I got a tourist visa.

77
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:25,425
You're a resident now.It's time to study.
I can't believe you're going on a sightseeing trip.

78
00:08:27,453 --> 00:08:29,526
What's the point of being a goof doctor ?

79
00:08:31,114 --> 00:08:34,481
I'm just going to get my dad to pay for me to open my own practice.

80
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,657
Throw me out and leave me alone.

81
00:08:46,235 --> 00:08:46,995
Don't you love me?

82
00:08:50,787 --> 00:08:53,720
I'll write you letters.
Lots of them.

83
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:14,970
Domyaku Retto / Dynamic Islands (1975)

84
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,648
Excuse me.
Toilet clogged.

85
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:41,005
I can't flash

86
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:41,812
Can't?

87
00:11:43,122 --> 00:11:46,642
What's the hell about SHinkansen.
The ticket is high

88
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:50,208
What's the hell about national railway?

89
00:11:52,492 --> 00:11:54,145
Work properly

90
00:12:23,371 --> 00:12:24,324
The toilet is broken?

91
00:12:48,025 --> 00:12:49,125
Something's clogged up in there.

92
00:13:02,914 --> 00:13:04,888
What is that? It's fluorescent paint.

93
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,089
It's a tea canister with felt wrapped around it.

94
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,959
If it's clogged with this stuff, there's no way it's going to flush.

95
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:23,715
Damn it?

96
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:26,115
What?

97
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:27,775
Could be a bomb.

98
00:14:15,764 --> 00:14:18,590
The code for the dimensional equipment is broken.

99
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,885
I'm KITAGAWA from the forensic lab.

100
00:14:29,822 --> 00:14:32,169
I'm Special Investigation Team Leader, AKASHI.

101
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:33,385
Thank you for your hard work.

102
00:14:36,371 --> 00:14:40,184
The tea canisters and fluorescent paint are ordinary stuff sold all over Japan.

103
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:41,098
What's inside?

104
00:14:43,584 --> 00:14:46,111
Mud for explosives.

105
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:52,338
I split it in two and examined it.

106
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:57,726
I found a plastic baggie filled with 15 cc.

107
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:03,313
We also found a letter of warning in a plastic bag.

108
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,646
warning letter?

109
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,099
Here's the warning letter.

110
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,497
Mixing nitroglycerin in with the MUD makes it dynamite.

111
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:18,975
If you plug in the code from the dimensional device, you could easily blow up the SHINKANSEN.

112
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,027
This is a warning to the JNR authorities.

113
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,308
Here's the conditions to solve pollution caused by Shinkansen

114
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:31,778
1.Reduce the noise during running to less than 60 minutes sound.

115
00:15:32,941 --> 00:15:36,868
2.Reduce vibration to 0.6 millimeters per second.

116
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,640
3.Reduce the speed in urban areas to 70 km/h or less.

117
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:48,351
Establish a 50-meter-wide buffer zone on both sides of the tracks.

118
00:15:50,393 --> 00:16:00,305
I will destroy the Shinkansen after 10 days, shut it down for at least two days, and paralyze it for at least a week.

119
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,933
destroy the Shinkansen?

120
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:10,776
This warning letter is not a prank.
To prove it, we will derail the Shinkansen tomorrow.

121
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,878
I saw the warning letter.

122
00:16:41,457 --> 00:16:45,624
JNR receives nearly 10 duress letters a month.

123
00:16:46,216 --> 00:16:48,389
And we get bomb threats every day.

124
00:16:49,469 --> 00:16:51,149
But it's all harassment and pranks.

125
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:53,646
I think that letter was one of them.

126
00:16:53,901 --> 00:16:55,587
It's serious.

127
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:59,891
He's a very smart guy to plant a bomb in a bathroom.

128
00:17:00,288 --> 00:17:00,995
Why?

129
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,873
A bomb in an aisle or on a shelf would be easy to spot, but in a toilet, it's invisible.

130
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:11,699
To get it out, we'd need the time and the tools to disassemble the electricity.

131
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:16,377
And if he did it, he definitely succeeded

132
00:17:17,747 --> 00:17:22,973
That man derailed a bullet train today.
And he's threatening to destroy it in nine days.

133
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:27,910
The only man who can arrest him is you. You're the only one out of 200,000 police officers in the country who can arrest him.

134
00:17:28,283 --> 00:17:29,923
I'm not an agent.

135
00:17:31,288 --> 00:17:37,268
You are a brilliant man who easily passed the bar exam national civil service exam and got into the police department.

136
00:17:38,241 --> 00:17:45,960
That's why I sent you to study criminology in the United States and Europe for three years when I was Director.

137
00:17:47,035 --> 00:17:49,762
I'm grateful for what you did, Mr. Director.

138
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,657
We created the Institute of Criminal Science in the National Police Agency and you became director... for what?

139
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:58,478
To use computers to solve crimes nationwide.

140
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,187
This case is perfect for you.

141
00:18:01,421 --> 00:18:02,947
But it's only been nine days.

142
00:18:04,746 --> 00:18:07,532
Can you find the killer among 100 million Japanese?

143
00:18:08,243 --> 00:18:10,596
You can do it, but you're the only one who can.

144
00:18:11,093 --> 00:18:14,773
Impossible. It's too hard

145
00:18:15,383 --> 00:18:17,010
I'm asking you.

146
00:18:43,857 --> 00:18:44,477
What's wrong?

147
00:18:45,257 --> 00:18:46,264
What's wrong?

148
00:18:52,988 --> 00:18:54,861
Be quiet

149
00:18:55,173 --> 00:19:02,273
This SHINKANSEN was supposed to stop at the Toyohashi station platform But it derailed.

150
00:19:02,756 --> 00:19:05,169
Was it the brakes?
Why did it derail?

151
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:10,650
We don't know the cause.
SHINKANSEN derailed

152
00:19:11,007 --> 00:19:13,780
Don't worry about that

153
00:19:16,538 --> 00:19:17,211
It's me

154
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,613
SHINKANSEN derailed at Toyohashi?

155
00:19:22,852 --> 00:19:24,359
Find out what caused it.

156
00:19:26,228 --> 00:19:28,861
This is what he said

157
00:19:30,074 --> 00:19:31,834
He's going to do it.

158
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:34,693
He's serious

159
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:39,456
If the bullet train is destroyed, there will be many victims.

160
00:19:40,515 --> 00:19:44,808
Imagine a bullet train going 200 kilometers an hour and flipping over.
It's like a plane going down.

161
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,011
Not a single one of the 1,000 passengers on board will survive.

162
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:52,784
You don't care about it?

163
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:58,947
I'm taking care of it

164
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:00,009
Can you?

165
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:05,039
But will the Metropolitan Police Department or the prefectural police follow my lead?

166
00:20:05,443 --> 00:20:07,696
It's an unprecedented case. It's an unprecedented case, so we're taking unprecedented measures.

167
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:10,849
I'll talk to the Metropolitan Police Department and the Prefectural Police Chief.

168
00:20:33,741 --> 00:20:37,834
I'm just glad it was only a derailment and no one was injured.

169
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,795
How did the SHINKANSEN stop?

170
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:42,934
200 kilometers an hour.

171
00:20:43,631 --> 00:20:46,178
Even if it stopped suddenly, it would still run 2500 meters.

172
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:52,083
If you'd applied the brakes even a little later, there would have been over 1,000 casualties.

173
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:57,835
Why didn't KODAMA stop at the platform?

174
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:05,023
The automatic control equipment at the atc and
Did the monitoring equipment at the ctc central command center malfunction?

175
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,956
Nope.
There was nothing wrong with either of them.

176
00:21:09,245 --> 00:21:14,425
I applied the brakes as instructed.
It didn't work at all.

177
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:15,604
It didn't work at all?

178
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:19,841
We found the cause of the KOIDAM derailment.

179
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:20,633
Tell me

180
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:27,365
About 70 meters from the point on the main upstream line to the secondary line was coated with cooking oil.

181
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:28,725
cooking oil?

182
00:21:30,167 --> 00:21:31,700
That's why the brakes didn't work and the train slipped.

183
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:38,371
But if he'd smeared oil on the rails, wouldn't someone see it right away and think it was suspicious?

184
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,243
But there were no witnesses.

185
00:21:41,964 --> 00:21:45,865
He was disguised as a JNR worker.

186
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:49,516
And then this envelope, which was left in this position here somewhere.

187
00:21:50,116 --> 00:21:51,489
It says "Warning Letter" on the front.

188
00:21:55,937 --> 00:21:57,304
I've derailed it as you predicted.

189
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,470
atc and ctc are useless with a drop of oil

190
00:22:03,566 --> 00:22:07,240
The oil could have been applied 3,000 meters before the main line.

191
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:12,596
In that case, the following HIKARI would have also slipped and hit KODAMA

192
00:22:13,575 --> 00:22:15,795
Over a thousand people would have been killed or injured

193
00:22:16,765 --> 00:22:19,838
But I don't want to kill a single innocent passenger

194
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:24,408
The bullet train will be destroyed in 9 days

195
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:26,763
Executioner

196
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:46,068
Shinkansen Threat Perpetrators Continue to Execute Kodama Toilet Bombs Toyohashi Train Derailment One After Another

197
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:53,310
The police department wanted to apprehend the perpetrators as soon as possible.

198
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:57,157
I'm Yamazaki, Chief of the Police Department's First Section.

199
00:22:57,361 --> 00:22:57,868
Thanks

200
00:22:58,439 --> 00:23:00,548
I'm SAGANO, Chief of the Public Safety Section of the Metropolitan Police

201
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:03,048
We heard from the commissioner.

202
00:23:03,384 --> 00:23:06,017
I'm AKASI, Chief of the Public Safety Bureau, Aichi Prefectural Police Department.

203
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,048
I'm Chief Nakano, Aichi Prefectural Police Public Safety Section Chief.

204
00:23:10,642 --> 00:23:12,493
I've been briefed by the Prefectural Police Chief.

205
00:23:12,923 --> 00:23:15,282
I'm Murata, Chief of the Investigation Department.

206
00:23:15,947 --> 00:23:21,314
Now, I'd like your opinion on who the culprit is.

207
00:23:23,273 --> 00:23:26,945
He's knowledgeable about explosives and the bullet train.

208
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,180
So he's a student radical... or an activist?

209
00:23:32,375 --> 00:23:36,805
If he was a radical, he would have blown up or overthrown the Shinkansen.

210
00:23:37,226 --> 00:23:40,898
These two warning letters aren't making any ideological claims.

211
00:23:41,851 --> 00:23:43,805
They're just complaints about the pollution caused by the Shinkansen.

212
00:23:46,914 --> 00:23:53,312
Perhaps the culprits are residents or their passengers along the troubled Shinkansen line

213
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:59,945
Residents along the line in 20 prefectures from Tokyo to Hakata?

214
00:24:00,281 --> 00:24:06,414
In fact, the same accident that caused this derailment Happened two years ago at the shinkansen base in Osaka.

215
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,359
When they greased the points of the retractable line, the brakes didn't work.

216
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,133
Who knows about that accident?

217
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:14,680
It was in the Osaka and Nagoya newspapers.

218
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:20,492
If that was a clue, the culprit was probably someone west of Hakone.

219
00:24:21,312 --> 00:24:23,578
The pollution problem is a noisy one.

220
00:24:23,937 --> 00:24:28,484
The Shin-Osaka to Hakata line has only been open for a short period of time, and more than half of it is through tunnels.

221
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:31,141
So there are no serious problems yet.

222
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,648
So it's between Osaka and Shizuoka.

223
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,766
Osaka, Gifu, Shizuoka and Hamamatsu have their own pollution problems.

224
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,383
But the residents are working it out with the JNR.

225
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,781
That leaves Aichi.

226
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,898
The culprits' demands are almost identical to those of the plaintiffs in the Shinkansen public disclosure lawsuit.

227
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:57,805
And these two warning letters use the same brown envelopes.

228
00:24:58,304 --> 00:25:01,952
They're made by a manufacturer in Fuji City and sold by a paper shop in Nagoya.

229
00:25:02,562 --> 00:25:04,569
Did you check the oil on the rails?

230
00:25:05,062 --> 00:25:07,905
It is made by a manufacturer in Chiba and sold mainly in the Tokyo area.

231
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,499
So the culprit could be a Tokyo resident.

232
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:13,929
But I doubt about Nagoya.

233
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:17,069
It's a risky bet, of course.

234
00:25:18,124 --> 00:25:21,663
We've only got nine days left until the execution.
That's not enough time

235
00:25:23,757 --> 00:25:26,593
How many residents are members of the Nagoya anti-pollution league?

236
00:25:27,632 --> 00:25:30,382
About 2,500 households.

237
00:25:31,085 --> 00:25:36,944
Of these, the lawyers have identified 575 residents as having been harmed.

238
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:39,905
These are the plaintiffs in the Shinkansen pollution lawsuit.

239
00:25:40,351 --> 00:25:44,726
Then, please start interviewing those 575 people immediately.

240
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:46,757
You've narrowed it down too much.

241
00:25:47,265 --> 00:25:48,819
It's a risky bet,

242
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:54,171
I want you to pay particular attention to those with knowledge of explosives and drugs.

243
00:25:54,554 --> 00:25:55,226
drugs?

244
00:25:55,812 --> 00:26:01,163
Nitrochryslin is an ingredient in dynamite, but at the same
But it's also a first aid kit for angina pectoris.

245
00:26:01,483 --> 00:26:05,272
I understand, sir, and the Aichi Prefectural Police will do everything in its power to help.

246
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:13,514
I'd like to hold a joint investigation meeting between the six of us, if necessary, in the future.
Will you cooperate?

247
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:20,183
 Thanks to the bullet train, it's only two hours from Nagoya to Tokyo, and we can always make a quick turnaround.

248
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:22,886
Thank you.

249
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:50,640
When the Shinkansen comes, all the babies around here cry.

250
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:55,906
And when you get sick, you go to an ambulance or a doctor.

251
00:26:55,931 --> 00:27:01,476
This noise really disturbs business

252
00:27:02,405 --> 00:27:06,523
Our profit has decreased, so I want JNR to provide a guarantee.

253
00:27:07,109 --> 00:27:12,163
When the Shinkansen passes, it makes a sound like thunder.

254
00:27:14,726 --> 00:27:18,038
I feel like I live near a construction site.

255
00:27:18,468 --> 00:27:25,835
The Shinkansen makes my hands shake at work

256
00:27:26,476 --> 00:27:31,257
Even if you put on a comforter, the sound of the Shinkansen echoes in your head.

257
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,729
Shinkansen is like a murderer

258
00:27:44,421 --> 00:27:44,882
Hi

259
00:27:47,182 --> 00:27:50,151
I'm with the Aichi Prefectural Police, and I'd like to ask you a few questions.

260
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:52,900
Please come in.

261
00:27:53,729 --> 00:27:56,377
The bullet train's too loud to talk here.

262
00:27:57,901 --> 00:28:02,182
You were an employee of Aichi Pharmaceuticals.
You were a salesman.

263
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:07,471
Well, I'm a salesman in the simplest sense of the word.
I sell drugs to hospitals and members.

264
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,440
Did you sell nitroglycerin?

265
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:14,244
No, I specialize in new drugs.

266
00:28:16,065 --> 00:28:19,494
By the way, you're a member of the plaintiffs' group in the Shinkansen pollution lawsuit?

267
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:25,487
You know what,I can't see the TV in this apartment.

268
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:29,189
I can't even sleep without taking sleeping pills.

269
00:28:30,416 --> 00:28:33,112
I hear you're one of the bravest of the plaintiffs.

270
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:38,135
If you lose the case, you'll jump on a bullet train with dynamite on your back?

271
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:40,471
What on earth do you want to ask?

272
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:45,830
There was a vicious threat against the Shinkansen.

273
00:28:46,002 --> 00:28:49,073
So you think I did it?

274
00:28:49,658 --> 00:28:52,698
You mean I used nitroglycerin to threaten them?

275
00:28:52,862 --> 00:28:54,791
Don't get us wrong

276
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:59,877
I'm confused. I'm short temper but

277
00:29:00,753 --> 00:29:04,870
But I'm a sensible member of society.
I would never commit acts of violence or vandalism.

278
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:10,780
We have a scientific basis for our demands.

279
00:29:11,577 --> 00:29:15,288
With this, we won't even lose in court.
There's no need to threaten me at all.

280
00:29:16,577 --> 00:29:19,288
The reality of life disturbance by Shinkansen

281
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:21,452
Nagoya University School of Medicine

282
00:29:22,171 --> 00:29:30,663
This is an accurate survey of radio interference, etc., measured by instruments and questionnaires.

283
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:31,667
I see.

284
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:35,370
I Looked at this report from 4 years ago!

285
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:44,862
I'm not the only one who suffers from Shinkansen pollution.
I realized that thousands of people were suffering from Shinkansen pollution. I started a united struggle with them.

286
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:02,422
It's a U.S. military one, after all.
they're very good

287
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:17,991
The Aichi Prefectural Police have cleaned out 575 plaintiffs in the pollution lawsuit group.

288
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:21,343
51 with knowledge of explosives and drugs.

289
00:30:21,975 --> 00:30:23,530
Eight with questionable alibis.

290
00:30:24,421 --> 00:30:29,678
I'm hoping to find the killer in this one.
What kind of man would that be?

291
00:30:29,975 --> 00:30:35,139
I studied criminal psychology.
I'm always trying to figure out the killer's personality.

292
00:30:35,772 --> 00:30:38,616
I'd love to hear what you think.

293
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:44,983
Ten days' notice to destroy the Shinkansen.He must be a very smart man or crazy

294
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:52,028
But his modus operandi is quite ingenious, and the warning letter was well-written.

295
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:53,989
He's an intelligent man with a very high level of education.

296
00:30:54,614 --> 00:30:56,512
He's an intelligent man with a very high level of education.

297
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:59,629
I would consider him a college graduate.

298
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:07,340
He's a quiet, stubborn, and thoughtful person.

299
00:31:08,239 --> 00:31:12,075
Age 25 to 35.

300
00:31:12,856 --> 00:31:13,731
Occupation?

301
00:31:14,675 --> 00:31:19,214
Well, if he's an office worker, he's a member of the elite, but he's also very dynamic.
He's creative.

302
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:22,034
he must be a freelancer

303
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:27,066
Is he an academic, a lawyer, a doctor or an artist?

304
00:31:27,511 --> 00:31:31,534
If he's a lawyer, he'll fight the law.
If he's an artist, he'll use the press.

305
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:39,534
He's an academic with a background in explosives and mechanics.
That would put him in touch with radical students.

306
00:31:39,972 --> 00:31:45,082
A middle-schooler could build a bomb.
I'm more suspicious of the doctor.

307
00:31:45,347 --> 00:31:45,933
Why?

308
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:48,332
15 cc nitroglycerin.

309
00:31:49,589 --> 00:31:50,386
This?

310
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:56,488
Nitroglycerin is hard to come by, but you can always find it in the pharmacy of any major hospital.

311
00:31:57,324 --> 00:31:59,050
Doctors can get it out?

312
00:32:00,191 --> 00:32:00,879
Yes

313
00:32:02,582 --> 00:32:08,215
I am very interested in the professor and two students of Nagoya University School of Medicine who wrote this report.

314
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,723
Please investigate about them

315
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,340
This is Sarugatari, my supervisor for this report.

316
00:32:35,303 --> 00:32:39,404
This is Shinoshima-kun, who was in charge of the survey.
He's a resident at our university hospital.

317
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,584
Did you write the report?

318
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:46,920
No, I just supervised it. It was all Shinozima-kun's work.

319
00:32:47,272 --> 00:32:49,967
Akiyama stayed up all night many times and worked hard all by himself.

320
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,311
I just helped out a little.

321
00:32:53,811 --> 00:32:56,467
It's as if he did it all by himself.

322
00:32:58,123 --> 00:33:02,584
It's a very well-written paper, and I was so impressed with it that I didn't touch it at all.

323
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:11,118
Akiyama is indeed doing his internship here in the Department of Internal Medicine.
He's not in Japan now.

324
00:33:11,852 --> 00:33:13,220
He's traveling around Europe.

325
00:33:13,634 --> 00:33:14,532
Europe?

326
00:33:16,712 --> 00:33:18,368
It can't be helped

327
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,665
Is there anyone who is close to Mr. Akiyama?

328
00:33:23,993 --> 00:33:26,423
He don't have any friends, but have a girlfriend.

329
00:33:27,118 --> 00:33:27,837
girlfriend?

330
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:32,540
Tomoko Kimihara, our pharmacist.
She looks lonely.

331
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:21,464
I checked the alibis of the eight plaintiffs in the pollution control group.
They were all in Aichi the day before yesterday and the day before that.

332
00:34:21,745 --> 00:34:26,527
Professor SARUQATARI and resident Dr. SHINOJIMA of Nagoya University's School of Medicine are also clean.

333
00:34:28,426 --> 00:34:31,504
But I'm fascinated by the doctor who wrote this report, Akiyama.

334
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:36,058
He's very logical and has a strong sense of justice.

335
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,363
The conclusion is also quite radical.
This man would do it.

336
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:45,202
If his girlfriend is a pharmacist. Nitroglycerin would be easy to come by.

337
00:34:45,898 --> 00:34:49,593
But he's not in Japan. He's traveling in Europe.

338
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:50,851
Europe?

339
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:54,132
Europe

340
00:34:55,812 --> 00:35:05,345
I see.
Now let's see if his passport has been issued. Find out if he really left Japan.

341
00:35:06,033 --> 00:35:06,822
I'll do that

342
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,728
I'm into him

343
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:19,626
Do a thorough background check and check his relatives and friends in Tokyo.

344
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:40,040
Hiroshi Akiyama?
Here

345
00:35:42,564 --> 00:35:47,103
This picture is definitely Akiyama himself, isn't it?

346
00:35:47,306 --> 00:35:52,830
Of course it is.
The passport application process has recently become much stricter.

347
00:36:09,332 --> 00:36:13,371
I'm Hiroshi Akiyama's father. Something about his son?

348
00:36:13,621 --> 00:36:17,074
it's about the bullet train pollution lawsuit.

349
00:36:18,746 --> 00:36:22,137
He has been very interested in the subject since his school days.

350
00:36:23,332 --> 00:36:24,723
How many siblings does he have?

351
00:36:25,918 --> 00:36:31,324
He's the second son of three, and the oldest son runs the family sawmill.

352
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:36,223
He cuts and processes finances from our mountains.

353
00:36:37,051 --> 00:36:38,973
How big is your mountain?

354
00:36:39,481 --> 00:36:41,551
300m2

355
00:36:42,903 --> 00:36:45,598
this place is so nice and old

356
00:36:45,981 --> 00:36:47,067
How about 3rd one?

357
00:36:48,262 --> 00:36:53,528
She is my daughter. She's married to the eldest son of a banker and they have one child.

358
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:56,309
Do you have any relatives in Nagoya or Osaka?

359
00:36:56,676 --> 00:37:02,387
Two in the lumber business and a manager of a jewelry company.

360
00:37:03,405 --> 00:37:04,561
Someone in Tokyo?

361
00:37:05,366 --> 00:37:14,239
Takeo Suenaga.
He's studying electronics at Waseda University.

362
00:37:15,317 --> 00:37:16,746
electronics?

363
00:37:20,595 --> 00:37:22,282
take out Mr. Akiyama's medical records?

364
00:37:22,759 --> 00:37:26,595
And while you're at it, could you also take his EKG and X-rays?

365
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,220
That's a problem.

366
00:37:28,852 --> 00:37:30,056
As a doctor, I'd rather not.

367
00:37:30,743 --> 00:37:33,931
I'm involved in a very important case.
Would you be willing to help us?

368
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:36,595
It can't be helped

369
00:37:37,548 --> 00:37:40,759
Get me the medical records on Nogami, who died the other day.

370
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,626
It won't bother the patient.

371
00:37:51,546 --> 00:37:54,265
Which part of Europe is Mr. Akiyama in right now?

372
00:37:54,828 --> 00:37:55,429
Paris.

373
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,211
The airmail arrived yesterday.

374
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:05,990
paris

375
00:38:08,834 --> 00:38:11,396
By the way, do you have a picture of him?

376
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:15,357
The one I like best.

377
00:38:15,529 --> 00:38:16,350
May I see ?

378
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,311
Mr. Akiyama, are you a suspect in something?

379
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:29,600
But he's irrelevant.
He's not in Japan.

380
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,827
I'd like you to accompany me to prefectural police headquarters.

381
00:38:34,334 --> 00:38:34,850
Why?

382
00:38:35,608 --> 00:38:37,334
It's a violation of the Explosives Act.

383
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:40,373
You took 15 CCs of nitruklycerin out of the pharmacy.

384
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:44,787
I have no idea

385
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:48,435
Isn't that a mistake?

386
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:15,070
Nogami..This is Akiyama's medical record

387
00:39:17,554 --> 00:39:23,351
Hiroshi Akiyama's cousin, Takeo Suenaga, was investigated I found out that he's been traveling in Europe for the past 10 days.

388
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:29,179
However, when we checked the immigration office.
He never left Japan.

389
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:31,679
How about Hiroshi Akiyama?

390
00:39:32,054 --> 00:39:34,429
He flew to Europe ten days ago.

391
00:39:35,148 --> 00:39:36,226
I need a photo of the two of them.

392
00:39:41,353 --> 00:39:44,603
Cousins of the same age.
They look a lot alike.

393
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:51,908
But Akiyama doesn't wear glasses anymore.
He went to the trouble of wearing glasses for the photo.

394
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:56,548
To look like Suenaga and pass himself off as him.

395
00:39:58,087 --> 00:40:01,204
It was Suenaga who went abroad using Akiyama's name and passport.

396
00:40:03,001 --> 00:40:04,408
Akiyama is in Japan.

397
00:40:06,384 --> 00:40:11,056
What about this postcard of Akiyama to Kimihara?

398
00:40:12,345 --> 00:40:14,251
It's postmarked by the Paris Post Office.

399
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:17,665
You can get foreign postcards anywhere

400
00:40:19,064 --> 00:40:22,884
Akiyama wrote them in Japan and Suenaga mailed them in Paris.

401
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,394
Please summarize the results of the Nagoya investigation.

402
00:40:26,753 --> 00:40:30,386
First, 15 CCs of nitroglycerin.

403
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:35,238
We believe this was stolen by Tomoko Kimihara, a pharmacist at a higher hospital.

404
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:42,222
Second
Postcard addressed to Tomoko Kimihara
Clear fingerprints of Akiyama were taken from the medical records of Yasushi Nogami.

405
00:40:43,714 --> 00:40:48,355
After comparing the fingerprints with those on the warning letter, we can conclude that they belong to the same person.

406
00:40:48,902 --> 00:40:52,902
Third, the handwriting on the postcard with the warning letter

407
00:40:53,995 --> 00:41:00,917
Writing pressure inclination degree
and hiragana in particular have something in common, and we believe that they are all written by the same person.

408
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:02,855
That's all I have to say.

409
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,011
Certainly, the medical record is the deciding factor.

410
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:11,800
I know how hard Akiyama worked to treat patients for 2 years.

411
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:16,679
But Yasu Nogami died.

412
00:41:18,453 --> 00:41:20,171
He must have been angry from the bottom of his heart.

413
00:41:21,265 --> 00:41:24,625
So he got his knowledge of the bullet train from his follower, Takeo Suenaga.

414
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:27,984
Where the hell is Akiyama?

415
00:41:29,148 --> 00:41:29,828
Tokyo, I'm guessing.

416
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:32,468
The oil on the rails is only available in Tokyo.

417
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:35,484
He's an idiot

418
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:38,085
He's leaving all these clues.

419
00:41:39,132 --> 00:41:41,273
He's young and confident.

420
00:41:44,234 --> 00:41:49,351
Six more days.Tokyo's a big city.
Ten million people.

421
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,757
We'll see if he can find Akiyama.

422
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:56,195
From now on... It's all up to us now.

423
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:10,980
This is A warning letter received by the president of Japan National Railways.

424
00:42:16,196 --> 00:42:19,173
in order to fundamentally solve the problem of bullet train pollution

425
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:25,837
I derailed a train with explosives and repeated warnings.

426
00:42:26,907 --> 00:42:30,063
But the JNR authorities have never shown any sincerity.

427
00:42:32,165 --> 00:42:35,415
My five-day notice of destruction is not a threat.

428
00:42:37,259 --> 00:42:41,595
I will stop the Shinkansen once again tomorrow morning.

429
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,071
Executioner

430
00:42:45,923 --> 00:42:52,829
He sent the same warning letters to three newspapers and NHK, as well as the president of Japan National Railways.

431
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:54,422
Where are you going?

432
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,931
I've got representatives from all the companies here right now.

433
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:04,454
I'm going to call off the press.
I need your help.

434
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:12,649
Chief of Police.According to this letter of warning...
The bomber used explosives and derailed the train twice to sabotage the bullet train.

435
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:14,711
Why did you keep it from us?

436
00:43:15,406 --> 00:43:17,750
We have a duty to report the truth.

437
00:43:17,906 --> 00:43:20,555
You put the public at risk, but you kept quiet.

438
00:43:21,242 --> 00:43:23,813
My boss force me to report it

439
00:43:24,156 --> 00:43:25,508
Right

440
00:43:26,281 --> 00:43:32,414
But if it is publicized to the public, there will be imitators.
And there will be many similar incidents.

441
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:41,008
can you please stop reporting on this warning letter?

442
00:43:41,649 --> 00:43:46,172
But what happens twice may happen thrice, and the culprit seems to be very tough.

443
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:51,930
In this way, the bullet train will be stopped tomorrow.
And in five days, it'll be completely destroyed.

444
00:43:52,125 --> 00:43:55,797
If there's a major accident, we're in big trouble.

445
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:59,086
We have to inform the public and protect their lives.

446
00:43:59,766 --> 00:44:01,360
That's the responsibility of the press.

447
00:44:02,446 --> 00:44:04,703
I ask you all to trust the police.

448
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:10,594
We won't let them stop the bullet train.
We'll catch the culprits in 5 days

449
00:44:11,373 --> 00:44:13,357
How far along are you in the investigation?

450
00:44:14,357 --> 00:44:15,045
takigawa

451
00:44:15,904 --> 00:44:19,545
We have a lead on the culprit, and we're working on his whereabouts.

452
00:44:21,443 --> 00:44:25,318
Please Recognize our efforts.

453
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:27,888
Let's do this

454
00:44:29,006 --> 00:44:32,092
If the bullet train doesn't stop tomorrow, we won't report it either.

455
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,467
But if the culprit stops the train, we will definitely report it.

456
00:44:36,279 --> 00:44:36,888
How about this?

457
00:44:37,271 --> 00:44:38,006
I agree.

458
00:44:38,732 --> 00:44:42,911
If you are credible, we don't report it.
If we know it's not working, we'll publish.

459
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:47,545
That way we can protect our position.
And the public will understand.

460
00:44:48,576 --> 00:44:53,654
This is a matter of honor for the National Police Agency.
Don't let him stop the bullet train tomorrow.

461
00:44:54,334 --> 00:44:59,006
I can't guarantee that.
We might lose to the criminals.

462
00:44:59,334 --> 00:44:59,896
Why?

463
00:45:00,592 --> 00:45:05,045
Even if the bullet train stops tomorrow, there's no danger to human life.

464
00:45:05,943 --> 00:45:08,349
The game is five days from now, when the train will be destroyed.

465
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:13,521
We should win at the end.
That's what I think.

466
00:47:10,396 --> 00:47:19,720
Shinkansen receivers are designed to prevent confusing signal waves
Shinkansen receivers are sharp, within plus or minus five hertz.

467
00:47:21,977 --> 00:47:25,051
163.07 megahertz.

468
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:32,134
If it picks up this signal, the train will automatically stop.

469
00:47:34,523 --> 00:47:35,730
The bullet train stops.

470
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:47,278
How did you get Nitro?

471
00:47:50,123 --> 00:47:53,036
You must have given it to Akiyama.

472
00:47:57,047 --> 00:47:57,913
I don't know.

473
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:05,018
Mr. Sada, the director of the Shinkansen General Planning Department, is here tonight.

474
00:48:05,737 --> 00:48:06,510
I'm Sanada

475
00:48:08,096 --> 00:48:12,576
First of all, please consider how Akiyama will stop the bullet train tomorrow.

476
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:16,960
The quickest way is to plant explosives on the train.

477
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:20,025
How do you stop it with explosives?

478
00:48:20,837 --> 00:48:29,673
Train tracks, of course.
27 atc ground signaling rooms at the ctc central command center.

479
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:34,311
28 radio stations

480
00:48:36,003 --> 00:48:41,090
25 edification stations.
If any one of them blows up The train will stop even if any one of them is blown up.

481
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,864
What if a simple tool was used to destroy the tracks?

482
00:48:44,776 --> 00:48:48,316
In that case, the current flowing through the rails would be cut off and the train would stop.

483
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:56,274
What if he dropped a large obstacle onto the tracks from a mountain, a hill, or a high road parallel to the tracks?

484
00:48:57,206 --> 00:48:58,813
It would be detected immediately.

485
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:09,542
The staff has protective switches every 250 meters. Every 500 meters, he'll use the phone to stop any nearby bullet trains.

486
00:49:10,255 --> 00:49:14,195
The culprit could use that switch phone to stop them.

487
00:49:14,961 --> 00:49:16,648
What are the alternatives?

488
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:20,733
There are countless ways.
It's a bullet train, safety first.

489
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:21,813
For example?

490
00:49:22,767 --> 00:49:27,314
A single conductor, two meters long, placed on the rails.
That'll stop it.

491
00:49:29,105 --> 00:49:33,518
The rails make a circuit every three kilometers.

492
00:49:33,886 --> 00:49:37,166
When a train enters the circuit, the current short-circuits it, and you know where it is.

493
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:44,004
So even if it's just one conductor, the current shorts out, and that's where the train is.
And it doesn't move.

494
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,294
Therefore, all the bullet trains coming after it will stop to avoid collision.

495
00:49:50,212 --> 00:49:51,152
Only one line

496
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:54,998
Three empty cans and three wet rags will stop it.

497
00:49:56,007 --> 00:49:56,733
How is this possible?

498
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:03,632
In the middle of the track, there's a thing that emits an automatic control signal every three kilometers.

499
00:50:05,892 --> 00:50:12,845
If you put three empty cans and a wet rag over it
The train can't pick up the signal and still stops

500
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:15,361
It's easy to stop

501
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:19,382
It's hard to find a way

502
00:50:19,672 --> 00:50:24,392
We can all be prevented if we're vigilant enough about the tracks and the expedition.

503
00:50:24,549 --> 00:50:29,802
But even if we put a cop every 100 meters, that's a lot of cops.
That's a lot of cops.

504
00:50:30,041 --> 00:50:31,967
We don't need to protect the entire Shinkansen.

505
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:35,626
This is my idea

506
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,549
We've narrowed it down to two crime scenes in Aichi and Shizuoka.

507
00:50:40,531 --> 00:50:42,671
That's where Akiyama know

508
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:46,294
But those two prefectures alone are quite large.

509
00:50:47,257 --> 00:50:50,671
Narrow it down even further... to the forested areas of both prefectures.

510
00:50:51,370 --> 00:50:53,816
It's harder to spot and easier to escape.

511
00:50:54,393 --> 00:50:55,827
Why not aim for the forest?

512
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:02,379
If he's in the mountains, hills or cliffs, he'll be in plain sight, surrounded and inescapable.

513
00:51:03,931 --> 00:51:04,511
Let's just ignore them.

514
00:51:05,921 --> 00:51:11,814
Aichi and Shizuoka are only about 100 kilometers from the forested area.

515
00:51:12,164 --> 00:51:13,990
That's enough to protect 2,000 police officers.

516
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:16,923
Please call the prefectural police in both prefectures.

517
00:51:19,594 --> 00:51:27,584
I'm making a lot of bets, but it's the nature of the case.
I'd like to make one more bet.

518
00:51:30,105 --> 00:51:32,992
The warning letter is postmarked at the Central Post Office.

519
00:51:35,377 --> 00:51:37,244
I still think Akiyama is in Tokyo.

520
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,227
When is he moving to Shizuoka or Aichi?

521
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:47,865
He's going to stop the train tomorrow morning, so tonight.
He could be there already.

522
00:51:48,834 --> 00:51:52,154
I'd say he'll be on the move early tomorrow morning.

523
00:51:53,506 --> 00:51:57,666
It's easy to hide in the big city of Tokyo.
In the countryside, he's more visible.

524
00:51:59,471 --> 00:52:01,257
He'll show up at the scene of the crime right before he does it.

525
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:03,106
I agree

526
00:52:04,074 --> 00:52:06,054
What would he use next to leave Tokyo?

527
00:52:07,068 --> 00:52:14,348
If he were to approach the bullet train quickly and make a hasty getaway, he'd need a small, fast car with good maneuverability.

528
00:52:15,079 --> 00:52:16,153
How would he get there?

529
00:52:16,813 --> 00:52:19,093
He can easily rent a car.

530
00:52:21,127 --> 00:52:22,134
Then let's make a decision.

531
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:28,703
Akiyama will rent a car tomorrow morning, get out of Tokyo, and head to Aichi.

532
00:52:30,084 --> 00:52:34,051
Find a rental car company in Tokyo and get Akiyama to rent a car.

533
00:52:34,378 --> 00:52:35,038
Understood.

534
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:46,901
Then checkpoints on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Keihin, Tomei Expressway, and other highways.
Do not let Akiyama go west of Tamagawa!

535
00:52:48,122 --> 00:52:51,029
I'll mobilize all the police officers in the Metropolitan Police Department.

536
00:53:09,977 --> 00:53:12,277
Let me see your license

537
00:53:22,513 --> 00:53:24,480
Let me see your license

538
00:53:28,394 --> 00:53:29,780
Go ahead

539
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:33,726
Hiroshi Akiyama?
I haven't seen him

540
00:53:35,483 --> 00:53:37,430
Thank you

541
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:07,260
How was it?

542
00:54:08,194 --> 00:54:09,154
There wasn't

543
00:54:18,844 --> 00:54:19,958
Have you seen him?

544
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,978
I haven't seen him

545
00:54:31,011 --> 00:54:31,691
Shibuya?

546
00:54:33,108 --> 00:54:38,528
Akiyama is not coming?
Any car rental company?Don't give up.

547
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:46,014
He didn't come to Shibuya and Gotanda.I wonder how he escaped from Tokyo

548
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:49,649
Mr.Suenaga?
Here you go.

549
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,080
Safe drive

550
00:55:52,401 --> 00:55:55,508
I'll drop you off at the Hamamatsu office after lunch.

551
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:57,614
Thank you very much.

552
00:55:58,780 --> 00:55:59,807
Thank you very much.

553
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:07,523
163.07 megahertz

554
00:57:08,762 --> 00:57:10,288
Signal radio wave with zero speed

555
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,816
bullet train...please get it

556
00:57:16,764 --> 00:57:17,584
and stop

557
00:59:33,038 --> 00:59:35,578
He stopped the bullet train.

558
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:39,233
You are lost.
We'll be sure to report it

559
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:45,097
We're going to announce every warning we've given the last two times, every destruction threat in the next four days.
It's for the public's safety.

560
00:59:45,470 --> 00:59:46,470
It can't be helped

561
00:59:46,952 --> 00:59:50,258
You must have had a lot of security.
How could the he has outsmarted you?

562
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:52,588
Takigawa

563
00:59:54,336 --> 00:59:56,096
I'll explain

564
00:59:57,399 --> 01:00:09,590
He is believed to have sent a 163.07 megahertz speed zero signal radio wave from his rental car while driving on the highway, stopping the bullet train.

565
01:00:10,136 --> 01:00:12,469
You didn't foresee that crime at all?

566
01:00:13,472 --> 01:00:17,032
We checked out rental cars in Tokyo, but we didn't get around to the rural areas.

567
01:00:18,102 --> 01:00:21,322
We finally figured out what the killer was doing after the incident occurred.

568
01:00:22,016 --> 01:00:25,630
163.07 megahertz is a zero speed signal.

569
01:00:27,246 --> 01:00:28,607
Is this a JNR secret?

570
01:00:29,683 --> 01:00:31,423
No, it's in a publication about bullet trains

571
01:00:31,525 --> 01:00:32,985
Then you could have done something about it.

572
01:00:33,292 --> 01:00:38,450
It was a total failure. There's no room for visitors.
There's no excuse for this. I apologize.

573
01:00:40,084 --> 01:00:44,837
Apologies don't cut it.
What about the bullet train six days from now?
Can you prevent it?

574
01:00:46,034 --> 01:00:46,861
We are trying to prevent it.

575
01:00:46,922 --> 01:00:49,989
You can't say you're going to prevent it.
I'd like you to say you'll definitely prevent it.

576
01:00:50,413 --> 01:00:50,866
I can't

577
01:00:50,966 --> 01:00:51,599
You can't?

578
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,034
Because I hate the word "never.

579
01:00:54,154 --> 01:00:55,501
You can't count on us

580
01:00:55,742 --> 01:00:57,349
They'll lose again

581
01:00:57,762 --> 01:00:59,902
I have a big announcement to make at the end.

582
01:01:03,999 --> 01:01:06,005
big announcement?

583
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:17,982
The police have identified the perpetrator of this crime as 28-year-old Hiroshi Akiyama, a resident of Nagoya High School Hospital, and have issued a nationwide manhunt.

584
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:39,643
The car used in the crime was found in front of Hamamatsu Station.

585
01:01:40,224 --> 01:01:44,051
But We still don't know where's Akiyama now

586
01:01:44,854 --> 01:01:46,314
Police will...

587
01:02:03,063 --> 01:02:06,269
I'll be away on a trip on the 23rd.
Please take care of my house while I'm gone.

588
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:08,167
Have a nice trip

589
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:25,574
Commissioner of Police

590
01:02:27,477 --> 01:02:30,497
Are you really confident that you can arrest Akiyama?

591
01:02:31,618 --> 01:02:36,732
200,000 police officers are currently pursuing his whereabouts.

592
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:38,764
It's only a matter of time before they arrest him.

593
01:02:39,375 --> 01:02:44,502
We can't allow the anti-pollution movement to turn violent.

594
01:02:45,693 --> 01:02:51,460
But even if you put out a nationwide manhunt, there are still 10,000 people who can't be caught.

595
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:56,890
The arrest rate is declining, but it's still the highest in the world.

596
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:04,866
I have no doubt in the high caliber of Japanese police officers... and their enthusiasm and hard work.

597
01:03:05,913 --> 01:03:07,906
How can we count on you?

598
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,110
President of the National Government

599
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:23,184
The Central Pollution Control Council has already recommended that the noise level of the Shinkansen should be less than 70 lines in urban areas and 75 lines in small industrial areas.

600
01:03:26,007 --> 01:03:28,067
Why don't you grant Akiyama's request?

601
01:03:28,715 --> 01:03:36,843
The Pollution Control Council's recommendation is very sincere.
We will give it our full consideration.

602
01:03:38,875 --> 01:03:51,814
But unfortunately, it is impossible to do so immediately with the current JNR's strength alone.

603
01:03:52,572 --> 01:03:58,166
So you don't mind if the Shinkansen is destroyed in four days?

604
01:04:01,168 --> 01:04:09,933
If a bullet train derails and overturns
At least a thousand people would die.

605
01:04:12,612 --> 01:04:18,965
If another train were to collide with it. The number of victims will rise from 2,000 to 3,000 in one fell swoop.

606
01:04:22,418 --> 01:04:24,264
It'll be the biggest accident in the world.

607
01:04:25,024 --> 01:04:26,704
It'll be the biggest event in the history of the world.

608
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:30,167
Prime minister,Minister of Transportation

609
01:04:32,337 --> 01:04:37,537
Can a government that controls the lives of its citizens allow this to happen?

610
01:04:38,415 --> 01:04:43,015
I call for the total resignation of the cabinet.

611
01:04:43,361 --> 01:04:44,821
We agree

612
01:04:45,904 --> 01:04:51,650
This concludes our live coverage of the House of Representatives Committee on Special Programs.

613
01:04:52,318 --> 01:04:56,685
Nice work, Akiyama.
He's a big guy for a 28 year old.

614
01:04:57,952 --> 01:05:01,338
He's good medicine for the JNR.
Maybe they'll reconsider.

615
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:09,060
After all, they're up against something big. They're the Japanese National Railways.
It's more interesting than a bad boxing match.

616
01:05:11,815 --> 01:05:12,341
How much?

617
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:13,675
1700yen

618
01:05:24,779 --> 01:05:38,121
The government could not refute anything pursued by the opposition.Government Fails to Take Any Effective Steps to Address Shinkansen Destruction Threats

619
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:43,412
The seriousness of the pollution problem caused by the Shinkansen has been highlighted once again

620
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,890
The culprit, Hiroshi Akiyama, was born in Mukoda Town, Aichi Prefecture

621
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:53,216
News about Akiyama again?
It's too noisy

622
01:05:53,441 --> 01:05:59,595
Young people these days don't have enough hardship and patience.
If they don't like something, they start bombing and demonstrating.

623
01:06:01,083 --> 01:06:04,643
He doesn’t care what we are in trouble

624
01:06:05,344 --> 01:06:06,744
Turn off the TV.

625
01:06:07,894 --> 01:06:12,301
Akiyama went to Nagoya University Medical School.

626
01:06:17,475 --> 01:06:18,229
Another drink?

627
01:06:18,935 --> 01:06:20,182
I'll have it

628
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:24,432
Can I get one too?

629
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:25,532
Sure

630
01:06:28,647 --> 01:06:29,454
You look lonely.

631
01:06:30,274 --> 01:06:30,947
Do I look lonely?

632
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:32,638
What's your name?

633
01:06:33,271 --> 01:06:34,244
I'm Fumiko.

634
01:06:34,995 --> 01:06:37,722
I'm Miki

635
01:06:43,149 --> 01:06:45,462
Nice to meet you, Miki.

636
01:06:48,409 --> 01:06:51,202
You have nice skin and eyes.

637
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:54,113
You think so?

638
01:06:54,932 --> 01:06:55,799
You don't have confident?

639
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:02,449
I don’t have, I'm broken heart

640
01:07:03,081 --> 01:07:08,167
He was 3rd one. oh it's 11pm, time to close

641
01:07:09,516 --> 01:07:10,356
Wanna go out?

642
01:07:12,243 --> 01:07:13,496
Wanna come my apartment?

643
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:23,632
Is this your book?

644
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:27,660
Yes, I used to be a nurse.

645
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:29,254
Internal medicine?

646
01:07:32,015 --> 01:07:34,749
Same as you,right?

647
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:38,347
You told me fake name

648
01:07:40,122 --> 01:07:41,535
Hiroshi Akiyama

649
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:48,512
You're being chased by the police and have nowhere to stay.

650
01:07:49,772 --> 01:07:50,612
You'll be safe here.

651
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:53,135
I make you trouble

652
01:07:53,849 --> 01:07:54,622
Don't worry

653
01:07:56,541 --> 01:07:59,014
I like the way you do

654
01:08:01,313 --> 01:08:03,953
I don't want to be alone tonight.
Stay with me

655
01:08:06,445 --> 01:08:07,138
Stay with me

656
01:08:08,905 --> 01:08:09,572
Stay with me

657
01:08:12,972 --> 01:08:17,599
You know, I used to think that all doctors were hypocrites.
That's what I thought.

658
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,973
So you got cheated out?

659
01:08:22,016 --> 01:08:23,670
That's why I quit nursing.

660
01:08:24,493 --> 01:08:26,220
I've only been a hostess for six months.

661
01:08:27,677 --> 01:08:32,150
I've been a hostess for six months, and all men are jerks.
But you're so admirable.

662
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,864
Normal doctors ignore bullet train pollution.

663
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:40,076
They are selfish or something

664
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,951
I'm glad I met you

665
01:08:49,963 --> 01:08:51,322
I'm gonna get drunk tonight.

666
01:08:52,057 --> 01:08:52,877
Stay with me

667
01:09:02,711 --> 01:09:08,507
The vandalism threats have caused a great deal of unrest within the JNR.

668
01:09:09,898 --> 01:09:12,664
The union filed a motion to compel this morning.

669
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:22,413
We don't know what will happen on the day.
Therefore, unless the culprit is arrested beforehand.
Unless the culprit is arrested in advance, we will refuse to board the bullet train on the day of the notice.

670
01:09:23,289 --> 01:09:25,148
The bullet train will not run at all.

671
01:09:25,789 --> 01:09:30,468
That's not good.
Shinkansen is Japan's main artery and a pillar of the Japanese economy.

672
01:09:31,218 --> 01:09:35,054
Shinkansen is not only for JNR anymore, it belongs to Japan, to the people.

673
01:09:35,734 --> 01:09:36,953
We should operate

674
01:09:38,468 --> 01:09:39,500
Why do you think so?

675
01:09:40,234 --> 01:09:44,382
I will talk it over with the union and get them to withdraw their refusal to let me on the train.

676
01:09:45,351 --> 01:09:47,906
But there's nothing we can do if the bullet train is stopped that day.

677
01:09:49,031 --> 01:09:54,703
Takigawa-kun, who commands the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department and the prefectural police.
Can he be trusted?

678
01:09:55,921 --> 01:10:02,812
Don't worry.
Takigawa is the best man in the National Police Agency.
He's the only one who can solve this case.

679
01:10:04,005 --> 01:10:05,083
We need him

680
01:10:45,661 --> 01:10:46,786
I'm Hiroshi Akiyama.

681
01:10:49,442 --> 01:10:50,052
Akiyama?

682
01:10:51,263 --> 01:10:56,114
I know it's late at night and I don't mean to be rude, but I'm a wanted man and I can only move at night.

683
01:10:57,403 --> 01:10:59,302
I need to speak to you

684
01:11:00,896 --> 01:11:01,685
you're bold

685
01:11:03,148 --> 01:11:04,507
You'll be arrested

686
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,703
Do you wan to notify the police?

687
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:10,242
I'm not police

688
01:11:12,578 --> 01:11:16,992
You're challenging JNR. I will discuss it with you as the person in charge of

689
01:11:19,414 --> 01:11:20,093
Come in.

690
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:30,070
I'd offer you some tea, but
My wife's in bed with a backache and the nanny's taking a bath.

691
01:11:31,710 --> 01:11:38,921
You know how the residents along the Shinkansen line are suffering.

692
01:11:41,109 --> 01:11:46,523
Mr. Akiyama
Japan was in a period of rapid economic growth at the time.

693
01:11:47,452 --> 01:11:50,898
We had to build the Shinkansen in time for the Olympics.

694
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:57,382
It was a rush job, so there was no time to think about the pollution problem.

695
01:11:58,398 --> 01:12:03,210
But the residents along the line have already been suing since six months after the opening.

696
01:12:04,585 --> 01:12:06,476
You let it go for more than 10 years.

697
01:12:07,734 --> 01:12:14,476
JNR's management is also having a hard time.
Currently, they have an accumulated deficit of 1.3 trillion yen.

698
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:19,984
And it will probably increase by about 100 billion yen every year.

699
01:12:21,273 --> 01:12:27,921
It's very unfortunate, but the reality is that we can't even provide for pollution as much as we'd like.

700
01:12:28,585 --> 01:12:33,742
The Shinkansen had a profit of 650 billion yen by 1973.

701
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:37,770
Can't you use the profit to solve the pollution?

702
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:42,630
If we reduce the speed of the Shinkansen to 70 kilometers per hour as you demand...

703
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:48,389
Sure, the noise will be 60 horns and the vibration will be 0.6 mm.

704
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:54,732
But it can't carry 350,000 passengers a day!

705
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:59,295
What about creating a 50 meter wide interference zone on both sides of the tracks?

706
01:13:00,553 --> 01:13:05,685
It would cost enough money to build another Shinkansen just to acquire that land.

707
01:13:07,466 --> 01:13:11,474
However, it is possible to acquire the land little by little.

708
01:13:11,990 --> 01:13:18,888
From people who hurt the people along the line and get away with it.
It's an example of the vice of getting land cheaply.

709
01:13:20,044 --> 01:13:22,865
Ideals can't be achieved in one fell swoop.

710
01:13:23,896 --> 01:13:28,787
I'm going to take my time and solve this problem step by step.

711
01:13:28,888 --> 01:13:30,130
I can't believe it

712
01:13:31,396 --> 01:13:33,060
That's why I'm destroying the bullet train.

713
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,810
Nothing can be changed

714
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:42,669
If nothing changes, another Akiyama will come out.and do the same thing until the JNR regrets what it's done.

715
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:46,029
I'm sorry, but I'm more troubled by this than you are

716
01:13:47,794 --> 01:13:58,325
Japan's problems are full of contradictions. Do you really believe that Japan's problems can be solved only by simple idealism like yours?

717
01:13:58,693 --> 01:14:00,615
I am not an idealist.

718
01:14:02,013 --> 01:14:03,896
I'm a doctor who can't even save a human life.

719
01:14:05,271 --> 01:14:10,654
Mr. President, have you ever lived with 100 horns of noise?

720
01:14:12,435 --> 01:14:13,365
Let you listen something.

721
01:14:14,943 --> 01:14:17,997
My patients have died because of it.

722
01:14:57,039 --> 01:14:59,172
Three days from now, 12:00 noon.

723
01:15:00,609 --> 01:15:02,867
At 12:00 sharp, I'll be done with the plan.

724
01:15:04,469 --> 01:15:05,984
This is your last notice.

725
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:12,209
You're going to do this by any means necessary?

726
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:15,186
You're not going to fight us in court?

727
01:15:15,952 --> 01:15:19,897
I don't trust the courts.
The powers that be will intervene.

728
01:15:21,991 --> 01:15:23,756
Mr. Akiyama, I think your request is correct.

729
01:15:24,475 --> 01:15:26,178
I'd like to do the same if I could.

730
01:15:27,436 --> 01:15:29,702
But let me make this clear.

731
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:34,256
Destroying the Shinkansen is a criminal act.

732
01:15:35,639 --> 01:15:37,420
You don't want innocent passengers to be involved.

733
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:41,420
If you're worried... Please don't let any passengers on board.

734
01:15:41,881 --> 01:15:43,053
We can't

735
01:15:43,608 --> 01:15:46,202
Then I'll have you take responsibility.

736
01:15:46,592 --> 01:15:47,647
Of course I'll take responsibility.

737
01:15:49,225 --> 01:15:50,584
But how about you?

738
01:15:51,912 --> 01:15:53,639
I don't care what happens.

739
01:16:11,611 --> 01:16:19,181
I can't believe he even went to the JNR president's mansion.
That Akiyama guy's got no respect for me.

740
01:16:19,494 --> 01:16:21,845
He's very active

741
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,236
Tapes.
recording Tapes.

742
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:27,494
Tape?

743
01:16:27,642 --> 01:16:31,330
Akiyama taped his conversation with the President and brought it to TV Tokyo.

744
01:16:31,759 --> 01:16:35,697
They're going to air the tape today at 3:00 p.m. on TV Tokyo.

745
01:16:36,877 --> 01:16:40,783
Akiyama just wants to use the media to spread the word about Shinkansen pollution.

746
01:16:41,884 --> 01:16:42,424
Let's leave him alone.

747
01:16:42,705 --> 01:16:45,314
But he's a wanted criminal.

748
01:16:46,252 --> 01:16:49,174
I don't know if it's okay for him to move around so much and do whatever he wants.

749
01:16:50,517 --> 01:16:52,783
What do you think?

750
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:58,174
Sure, he keeps winning, and he's lucky.

751
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:01,627
But luck doesn't last forever.

752
01:17:03,345 --> 01:17:05,634
It's time to fall out of luck and lose.

753
01:17:05,697 --> 01:17:11,095
You're so carefree.
Anyway, I'd like to meet with the station's programming director and the director of the TV station to get them to stop the show.

754
01:17:11,447 --> 01:17:12,299
Come with me.

755
01:17:16,776 --> 01:17:22,010
Mr. President, have you ever lived with 100 horns of noise?

756
01:17:24,043 --> 01:17:29,480
Let you listen something.
My patients have died because of it.

757
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:52,567
Akiyama is the single most talked-about person in Japan today.

758
01:17:53,613 --> 01:17:57,520
It's the real voice of the President of the Japanese National Railways.

759
01:17:58,012 --> 01:18:00,567
We want this tape aired.

760
01:18:00,957 --> 01:18:03,160
How did you get it?

761
01:18:03,684 --> 01:18:06,957
Akiyama called me, the director, just after 9:00 a.m.

762
01:18:08,629 --> 01:18:12,988
If you want the tape, it's in the coffee shop in front of the station.
He said to pick it up under the name Miki.

763
01:18:13,895 --> 01:18:14,684
This is it?

764
01:18:15,543 --> 01:18:16,137
That's right.

765
01:18:16,777 --> 01:18:17,707
Who left the tape with you?

766
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:19,488
Akiyama himself.

767
01:18:20,684 --> 01:18:27,520
To be safe,I showed the waitress Akiyama's picture to confirm.

768
01:18:27,957 --> 01:18:32,942
But if this is aired, there will be distrust of the police.
And social unrest will increase.

769
01:18:34,325 --> 01:18:36,465
The president will want to take this off the air.

770
01:18:37,153 --> 01:18:40,895
Anyway, I'll have him pick up the phone and you'll talk it over.

771
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:44,410
I didn't know we had it on tape.

772
01:18:46,012 --> 01:18:49,239
But there's no need to stop the TV station from airing it.

773
01:18:49,926 --> 01:18:51,965
I take full responsibility.

774
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:59,656
I want you to do everything in your power to stop the crime the day after tomorrow.
I beg you.

775
01:19:30,619 --> 01:19:35,001
We left Tokyo at 9.20pm.
You did a great job driving for more than 5 hours!

776
01:19:36,619 --> 01:19:37,533
Where are you going now?

777
01:19:40,314 --> 01:19:41,197
Sakanozaka Tunnel.

778
01:20:14,816 --> 01:20:17,894
Nothing has changed.
It's the same as it was in the old days.

779
01:20:21,433 --> 01:20:25,715
This is Saka no Saka Next to Nukatamachi.

780
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:31,129
This is where I was born.
There's a sawmill on the outskirts of town.

781
01:21:44,793 --> 01:21:45,746
What are you going to do now?

782
01:21:47,949 --> 01:21:51,519
Do you want to go to the motel Royal Plaza in Nagoya that we decided on earlier?

783
01:21:53,496 --> 01:21:56,855
Why don't you go ahead and stay there under an assumed name?
I'll come back later.

784
01:21:57,973 --> 01:22:01,667
I'll be waiting for you.

785
01:22:03,307 --> 01:22:03,979
I'll be waiting for you.

786
01:25:40,163 --> 01:25:40,742
Who?

787
01:25:40,875 --> 01:25:41,531
It's me.

788
01:25:52,285 --> 01:25:53,191
You're late.

789
01:25:54,535 --> 01:25:56,597
I had to return the truck to the sawmill.

790
01:25:57,933 --> 01:25:59,957
I couldn't get a cab.

791
01:26:01,644 --> 01:26:02,996
What do you use a bulldozer for?

792
01:26:07,238 --> 01:26:08,738
You don't have to know.

793
01:26:10,394 --> 01:26:12,183
Drop a stone down the hill?

794
01:26:14,785 --> 01:26:16,027
I'm exhausted

795
01:26:18,589 --> 01:26:19,746
Let's take a bath and go to bed.

796
01:27:23,044 --> 01:27:25,231
Hello?

797
01:27:30,573 --> 01:27:32,870
Takigawa
It's finally tomorrow, isn't it?

798
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:35,089
What's the security plan?

799
01:27:35,737 --> 01:27:41,237
Akiyama says he'll shut down the bullet train for at least two days, paralyzing it for at least two weeks.

800
01:27:42,151 --> 01:27:44,339
The question is how.

801
01:27:44,636 --> 01:27:46,487
It's got to be a train derail and overturn

802
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:50,401
If he does it, at least 1,000 people will die.

803
01:27:51,222 --> 01:27:53,323
I don't think Akiyama would kill someone.

804
01:27:53,964 --> 01:27:56,886
But he's cornered, and there's no telling what he'll do.

805
01:27:57,886 --> 01:28:00,659
But what kind of method would he use to derail and overturn a train?

806
01:28:01,222 --> 01:28:04,675
Drop a truck or a car on the tracks.
And hit the bullet train?

807
01:28:05,105 --> 01:28:08,323
If he drop it early enough, the warden will spot it and stop the train immediately.

808
01:28:08,706 --> 01:28:13,167
If the obstacle is an electric double-acting object, the moment it is dropped, the electric current in the circuit will short-circuit.

809
01:28:14,386 --> 01:28:16,472
The bullet train will stop and won't collide.

810
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:20,276
At 200 km/h, the train will run 2,500 meters even if the brakes are applied.

811
01:28:21,472 --> 01:28:24,206
He could drop the train when it approaches within 2,500 meters.

812
01:28:25,026 --> 01:28:27,651
Or hit the train itself while it's in progress.

813
01:28:28,175 --> 01:28:32,737
Takigawa. Make sure you prevent the train from derailing and capsizing.

814
01:28:32,995 --> 01:28:38,573
Now, this time, instead of the forested dirt.
We'll focus our security on the mountains and hills, where there are more cutouts.

815
01:28:39,651 --> 01:28:43,026
It's easier to drop obstacles, and Akiyama won't mind being arrested.

816
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:46,269
Where do you think the crime took place?

817
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:50,128
I still think Shizuoka and Aichi prefectures.

818
01:28:51,042 --> 01:29:00,448
I'm thinking Shizuoka and Aichi prefectures.
We'll be on high alert in those areas.

819
01:29:01,761 --> 01:29:03,355
Mishima Tago, which has many cut-through sections, as a priority area.

820
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:13,081
Hoshigoe Tunnel and Saka-no-Saka Tunnel on Mikawa Bay
Okehazama Tunnel near Nagoya.

821
01:29:14,081 --> 01:29:16,776
In both cases, two officers each at the exit entrances to the tunnel

822
01:29:17,745 --> 01:29:22,081
Along the line will be 2 policemen on each side every 100 meters

823
01:29:22,472 --> 01:29:23,831
How many police officers will be mobilized?

824
01:29:24,269 --> 01:29:25,362
80,000.

825
01:29:25,784 --> 01:29:27,003
That's a lot of men.

826
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:31,112
I'm going to Nagoya with Mr. Nakano and Mr. Murata

827
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:35,698
It's Akiyama's hometown. He knows the geography. It's an easy place to execute.

828
01:29:36,081 --> 01:29:39,698
I guess I can really trust you?

829
01:29:43,651 --> 01:29:47,174
It's time to return the favor.
Don't worry.

830
01:30:07,871 --> 01:30:09,363
Two days in there, we gonna look suspicious

831
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:10,730
Let's move

832
01:30:12,051 --> 01:30:13,324
You want to move on to another motor?

833
01:30:14,027 --> 01:30:16,793
yeah, they don't see any customers.

834
01:30:37,651 --> 01:30:39,510
Tomorrow at 12:00, are you sure you want to do?

835
01:30:40,909 --> 01:30:41,589
Yeah

836
01:30:42,932 --> 01:30:44,909
You're gonna get caught, and you're gonna go to jail.

837
01:30:46,839 --> 01:30:47,549
I'm ready.

838
01:30:50,049 --> 01:30:50,628
Stop it

839
01:30:50,831 --> 01:30:51,448
Why?

840
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:55,784
I love you so

841
01:31:03,030 --> 01:31:03,937
I want to live with you.

842
01:31:05,726 --> 01:31:06,546
I can't

843
01:31:07,773 --> 01:31:08,632
Why would you want that?

844
01:31:10,038 --> 01:31:10,749
Yeah

845
01:31:17,531 --> 01:31:19,312
You just played me

846
01:31:22,039 --> 01:31:23,125
That's better

847
01:31:25,148 --> 01:31:26,773
We shouldn't be more than that.

848
01:31:31,559 --> 01:31:38,559
Results of Collective Bargaining
The union has withdrawn their refusal to let me on tomorrow.

849
01:31:40,107 --> 01:31:44,427
Okay.
Thank you very much

850
01:31:45,185 --> 01:31:47,450
But there's one condition.

851
01:31:48,692 --> 01:31:56,012
The Japanese National Railways, the labor unions, the pollution victims, and representatives from the four companies.

852
01:31:56,521 --> 01:32:01,247
We'd like you to form a special committee to come up with a real solution to the pollution problem.

853
01:32:01,599 --> 01:32:04,427
Of course I agree.

854
01:32:05,271 --> 01:32:10,466
Tomorrow the police will be on full alert to prevent any accident.

855
01:32:11,685 --> 01:32:13,489
can you do it?

856
01:32:14,927 --> 01:32:17,200
I assure you I'll take care of it.

857
01:32:18,619 --> 01:32:21,189
Thank you very much for your time.

858
01:32:23,236 --> 01:32:26,658
The bullet trains will continue to run as usual.
Tell that to the PR director.

859
01:32:47,376 --> 01:32:51,907
Security in Shizuoka is complete What about security in Aichi?

860
01:33:27,373 --> 01:33:33,256
We've mobilized all the former detectives of the Aichi Prefectural Metropolitan Police Agency to be on high alert.

861
01:33:34,217 --> 01:33:38,334
I always think about the quality of our officers.

862
01:33:39,756 --> 01:33:43,357
Many of them are good, but many of them are idiots.

863
01:33:45,092 --> 01:33:46,826
Which one of them will bump into Akiyama?

864
01:33:46,935 --> 01:33:50,084
It's all luck.
There's nothing we can do.

865
01:33:51,349 --> 01:33:53,482
he can be apprehended with the slightest clue.

866
01:33:54,201 --> 01:33:57,427
A good cop can find him, but a stupid man can miss him.

867
01:33:58,474 --> 01:34:01,959
If you see anything out of the ordinary. If something unusual happens, will you let me know right away?

868
01:34:11,436 --> 01:34:13,350
The streets are full of cops.

869
01:34:13,874 --> 01:34:16,788
What course did you take up the hill?

870
01:34:18,428 --> 01:34:21,561
I took a cab from the Komaki interchange to the highway.

871
01:34:21,733 --> 01:34:24,811
The cops at the entrance took a look at the wanted photos.

872
01:34:26,436 --> 01:34:28,366
Same thing on the way out from the Toyokawa interchange.

873
01:34:30,788 --> 01:34:33,233
I knew it. Route 1.

874
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,030
Through Kityu and into Okazaki.

875
01:34:36,920 --> 01:34:38,764
Route 1 has the toughest checkpoints.

876
01:34:39,842 --> 01:34:42,006
They look in the trunk and under the seat.

877
01:34:44,087 --> 01:34:44,861
That's why it's okay.

878
01:34:45,939 --> 01:34:48,056
The cops won't think we're going down Route 1.

879
01:34:49,087 --> 01:34:50,056
Shall we go?

880
01:34:53,947 --> 01:34:54,736
Hello?

881
01:34:55,392 --> 01:34:57,376
2411391

882
01:34:58,572 --> 01:34:59,548
You sure to go?

883
01:35:07,542 --> 01:35:08,042
Hello?

884
01:35:08,597 --> 01:35:10,636
Is it a blood center?

885
01:35:12,534 --> 01:35:18,487
I have a 9:00 a.m. surgery at the First Hospital in Midorimachi, so I need 1,000 cc of type A blood at 8:30 a.m. I need you there at 8:30.

886
01:35:18,595 --> 01:35:19,751
To where

887
01:35:20,548 --> 01:35:22,157
To Dr. ONOMI of surgery

888
01:35:33,538 --> 01:35:36,303
9 o'clock at Meitetsu's Miya station.

889
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:38,507
9 o'clock

890
01:38:04,165 --> 01:38:04,665
Where to?

891
01:38:04,905 --> 01:38:09,178
Emergency blood transport to Okazaki Hospital

892
01:38:20,065 --> 01:38:23,131
You have to wear helmet when you drive an emergency vehicle.

893
01:38:24,769 --> 01:38:25,589
I was in a hurry. I forgot.

894
01:38:26,355 --> 01:38:27,209
Be careful next time.

895
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:29,868
Okay, go.

896
01:38:31,862 --> 01:38:34,116
Go left, go left.

897
01:38:44,878 --> 01:38:46,538
Go left, go left.

898
01:38:51,717 --> 01:38:52,336
Stop

899
01:38:53,644 --> 01:38:54,084
Sorry

900
01:38:54,384 --> 01:38:54,931
What?

901
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:57,115
surgery is at 9:00 a.m. Can I go to the

902
01:38:57,269 --> 01:38:57,929
Where's the hospital?

903
01:38:58,861 --> 01:39:01,361
It's right there, Okazaki Hospital.

904
01:39:05,077 --> 01:39:05,971
What's that bag?

905
01:39:08,189 --> 01:39:08,669
This?

906
01:39:09,069 --> 01:39:09,943
What's in it?

907
01:39:12,965 --> 01:39:18,285
I was told to deliver it as soon as I got to work.
A change of sweaters and a book to read on the train.

908
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:22,623
Don't need to open,
Go

909
01:39:25,422 --> 01:39:25,849
Thanks

910
01:39:38,383 --> 01:39:41,216
So nothing's happened yet?

911
01:39:41,389 --> 01:39:45,402
Well, the only incident was the theft of a blood truck.

912
01:39:46,029 --> 01:39:46,702
blood truck?

913
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:50,529
It was used to transport blood from a blood bank to Midorimachi First Hospital.

914
01:39:51,094 --> 01:39:55,861
The hospital doesn't remember ordering it, and it's not scheduled for surgery.
And there was no surgery scheduled.
The car was stolen during the dispute.

915
01:39:57,062 --> 01:39:57,922
That's it.

916
01:39:58,936 --> 01:40:03,549
Akiyama got in the blood truck and drove through the checkpoint.
Please get ready right away.

917
01:40:04,036 --> 01:40:04,629
We get it

918
01:40:06,721 --> 01:40:09,587
he is a doctor.
Good idea

919
01:40:52,660 --> 01:40:53,534
Police car

920
01:40:55,253 --> 01:40:58,186
Go left and stop,This car is safe.

921
01:41:12,374 --> 01:41:15,874
When I get into GAMAGORI, I  buy me a bike and a work thing.

922
01:41:18,499 --> 01:41:24,727
Then work shoes and a yellow helmet.
The dirtier the better.

923
01:41:27,391 --> 01:41:30,911
The blood truck was abandoned in front of Miyagi Station on the Meitetsu Line.

924
01:41:31,530 --> 01:41:35,490
Fingerprints in the car confirm that Akiyama was the driver.

925
01:41:36,586 --> 01:41:39,720
He's now within 17 kilometers of GAMAGORI and TOYOHASHI.

926
01:41:40,896 --> 01:41:42,743
We are finding him

927
01:41:43,482 --> 01:41:45,062
He might change cars.

928
01:41:46,985 --> 01:41:48,765
Stay alert from Kiyu to Hamamatsu.

929
01:41:49,823 --> 01:41:50,430
I get it

930
01:41:51,224 --> 01:41:54,811
By the way, Akiyama's parents live in Nukatamachi.

931
01:41:54,991 --> 01:41:55,404
Yes,

932
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:57,539
I'd like to go there.

933
01:41:58,022 --> 01:42:00,282
Why are you going there?

934
01:42:00,668 --> 01:42:04,048
He has three hours to stop the bullet train before noon.

935
01:42:06,087 --> 01:42:10,813
We've done what we had to do, and there's nothing to do here.

936
01:42:11,296 --> 01:42:11,923
But

937
01:42:12,602 --> 01:42:15,609
I've been thinking only about Akiyama for the past 10 days.

938
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:19,332
He's more like friend now

939
01:42:20,762 --> 01:42:23,595
I'm just trying to get a sense of who he is

940
01:42:42,194 --> 01:42:43,734
Thank you for everything.

941
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:48,478
You can leave now.

942
01:42:51,052 --> 01:42:53,626
Don't follow me or you'll be an accomplice.

943
01:42:55,467 --> 01:43:00,760
I don't care.
I knew it all along.

944
01:43:01,365 --> 01:43:02,131
Stupid

945
01:43:06,258 --> 01:43:07,151
I love you

946
01:43:12,058 --> 01:43:12,605
I love you

947
01:43:16,307 --> 01:43:17,293
Go home

948
01:43:22,143 --> 01:43:23,443
Go back to Tokyo.

949
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:29,897
Go back to Tokyo.

950
01:43:34,446 --> 01:43:38,340
Good luck, I won't forget about you

951
01:43:42,935 --> 01:43:43,735
See you

952
01:44:05,739 --> 01:44:08,359
I am so sorry.

953
01:44:09,297 --> 01:44:17,527
I've been confined to my house since he was declared wanted, and now I'm under house arrest.

954
01:44:18,526 --> 01:44:20,866
How did he turn out like that?

955
01:44:22,312 --> 01:44:24,832
He used to be such a sweet, cheerful boy.

956
01:44:26,436 --> 01:44:28,356
Did he come back here from time to time?

957
01:44:29,418 --> 01:44:32,591
Not at all.

958
01:44:33,801 --> 01:44:40,388
He used to come back every summer vacation when he was a student to help his oldest son in the lumber business.

959
01:44:41,283 --> 01:44:44,150
He would move trucks and bulldozers.

960
01:44:45,875 --> 01:44:48,022
Trucks and bulldozers?

961
01:44:50,499 --> 01:44:51,246
Where is it?

962
01:44:51,829 --> 01:44:52,916
I'd like to take a look at it.

963
01:45:05,468 --> 01:45:08,608
Where are you going?
The road's closed from now on.

964
01:45:08,907 --> 01:45:11,687
Oh my god,I came here to get that Bulldozer.

965
01:45:12,496 --> 01:45:16,768
You can't just throw him out there like that.
We've been trying to find the owner since yesterday.

966
01:45:17,796 --> 01:45:19,689
I'm sorry, I'll move it soon

967
01:45:19,714 --> 01:45:20,393
Go

968
01:45:29,729 --> 01:45:31,516
Thank you for your hard work.

969
01:45:41,383 --> 01:45:42,083
What's up with you?

970
01:45:42,603 --> 01:45:45,463
I was told by that police down there

971
01:45:46,767 --> 01:45:47,387
That Bulldozer.

972
01:45:47,900 --> 01:45:50,093
Get it out of here.

973
01:46:13,216 --> 01:46:17,330
This one doesn't work... it's got a chain wrapped around the controller.

974
01:46:24,004 --> 01:46:26,397
It's wrapped around a wire too!

975
01:46:29,230 --> 01:46:31,397
I'm so screwed!

976
01:46:32,669 --> 01:46:34,383
I have to get the keys from the director!

977
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:37,817
What group are you with? I haven't seen you around

978
01:46:39,474 --> 01:46:41,740
I just came from Toyohashi today

979
01:46:43,379 --> 01:46:44,699
Harada Civil Engineering

980
01:46:45,352 --> 01:46:46,726
You look like him.

981
01:46:47,933 --> 01:46:48,426
Who?

982
01:46:49,402 --> 01:46:50,089
The culprit.

983
01:46:51,515 --> 01:46:53,701
Don't joke about it.

984
01:46:54,134 --> 01:46:56,181
I've got kid and wife

985
01:47:26,840 --> 01:47:27,867
Here it is

986
01:47:34,367 --> 01:47:37,247
There's no bulldozer.
They are always lined up here.

987
01:47:37,924 --> 01:47:39,011
How much does the bulldozer weigh?

988
01:47:39,268 --> 01:47:41,115
About 10 tons.

989
01:47:41,241 --> 01:47:42,727
Come

990
01:47:43,822 --> 01:47:47,175
Contact Mr. Murata
Find me a bulldozer near the Shinkansen by helicopter.

991
01:47:50,391 --> 01:47:51,785
Let me radio in.

992
01:47:54,519 --> 01:47:57,659
Hello, please, Chief I, President of the General Command Center.

993
01:49:15,835 --> 01:49:18,842
We found bulldozer  in the Sakanozaka Tunnel.

994
01:49:19,987 --> 01:49:22,147
Tomoko Kitahara is still in detention?

995
01:49:24,126 --> 01:49:26,746
Ask Murata to bring her out there

996
01:49:31,275 --> 01:49:34,508
There's nothing I can say

997
01:49:35,454 --> 01:49:36,434
Nothing

998
01:49:36,459 --> 01:49:37,247
Get in the car

999
01:51:10,937 --> 01:51:12,130
Akiyama

1000
01:51:14,480 --> 01:51:17,147
Bulldozers are abandoned and can't be driven.

1001
01:51:19,162 --> 01:51:20,828
Destroying the bullet train is impossible.

1002
01:51:21,987 --> 01:51:24,474
Why don't you just give up on the plan and come out?

1003
01:51:27,537 --> 01:51:28,684
Can you catch me?

1004
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:32,087
Akiyama

1005
01:51:39,205 --> 01:51:39,898
Kimihara

1006
01:51:41,719 --> 01:51:44,479
I'm trying to help Mr. Akiyama.

1007
01:51:46,416 --> 01:51:48,163
He's going to drop a bulldozer on the tracks.

1008
01:51:49,808 --> 01:51:52,122
Please tell him to stop!

1009
01:51:55,301 --> 01:51:57,727
He listen to you

1010
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:09,561
Hiroshi

1011
01:52:12,276 --> 01:52:13,589
That's over

1012
01:52:15,349 --> 01:52:16,696
That's over

1013
01:52:19,002 --> 01:52:20,848
That's over

1014
01:52:24,186 --> 01:52:25,440
Hiroshi

1015
01:52:27,817 --> 01:52:29,364
Please get out

1016
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:32,838
Please get out

1017
01:52:48,677 --> 01:52:50,364
The engine started.

1018
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:24,618
It's not supposed to run.

1019
01:54:00,662 --> 01:54:04,909
It's radio controlled.
Hop in the driver's seat.

1020
01:54:06,223 --> 01:54:08,150
Pull the key out of the engine.

1021
01:56:24,350 --> 01:56:28,003
Get the police car to close it.
Jumping into a bulldozer from the top of the car

1022
01:56:31,493 --> 01:56:32,926
Jumping into a bulldozer

1023
01:56:42,613 --> 01:56:45,093
Pull the key out of the engine.

1024
01:57:42,202 --> 01:57:43,168
Akiyama

1025
01:57:44,743 --> 01:57:46,330
The bulldozer won't work anymore

1026
01:57:49,317 --> 01:57:51,084
so come out gracefully like you.

1027
01:57:53,221 --> 01:57:54,181
Akiyama

1028
02:00:51,385 --> 02:00:59,642
THE END

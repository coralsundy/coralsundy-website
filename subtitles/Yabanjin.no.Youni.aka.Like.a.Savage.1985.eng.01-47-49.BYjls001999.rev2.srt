00:03:34,262 --> 00:03:35,813
Tamako

3
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,233
Tamako

4
00:03:55,925 --> 00:03:58,458
Let's play together

5
00:03:58,637 --> 00:04:02,666
We brought fireworks

6
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,463
What happened?
Are you embarrassed?

7
00:04:26,108 --> 00:04:29,836
You look young
How old are you?

8
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:33,017
Do you want to know?

9
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:37,096
I'm 15

10
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:53,597
<i>Like A Barbarian</i>

11
00:06:18,204 --> 00:06:19,308
Here we go

12
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:34,186
When I see fireworks, I remember a saying: "Vie fireworks"

13
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:38,650
Vie fireworks?
Does that mean Beautiful?

14
00:06:39,855 --> 00:06:42,657
It is not. Vie is french

15
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:45,190
Vie? Like <i>c'est la vie (this is life)?</i>

16
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,898
It means life

17
00:06:47,489 --> 00:06:49,052
You have a good pronunciation

18
00:06:50,112 --> 00:06:51,384
I studied

19
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:56,351
<i>Fireworks like life</i> 
What a painful saying

20
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:59,956
What a great writer you are!

21
00:07:01,596 --> 00:07:04,777
It was written in a high school textbook

22
00:07:06,295 --> 00:07:10,782
It was a short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa

23
00:07:11,753 --> 00:07:16,418
A French officer came for technical guidance in the Meiji era

24
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:21,005
He saw the fireworks one day and said

25
00:07:22,132 --> 00:07:24,420
Fireworks like life

26
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:28,438
I was impressed with it

27
00:07:30,737 --> 00:07:32,712
French is very romantic

28
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,446
If I say it's very unpleasant

29
00:07:35,971 --> 00:07:38,460
France fits the scene very well

30
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:11,409
Ei-Chan

31
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,404
Eiji

32
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:24,278
Hello?

33
00:08:24,864 --> 00:08:27,755
Is that Eiji?
No one with you,right?

34
00:08:30,612 --> 00:08:32,751
Listen carefully

35
00:08:34,255 --> 00:08:36,032
Our boss was killed

36
00:08:40,329 --> 00:08:46,335
Anyway, Come here alone.

37
00:08:47,272 --> 00:08:52,829
Why?
I'll explain to you later

38
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:39,908
My first novel, which I wrote when I was 15, received recognition

39
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,517
They said I was a girl genius.

40
00:09:45,588 --> 00:09:49,504
I was impressed with you.

41
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,941
Thank you very much

42
00:09:53,615 --> 00:10:03,485
I felt like I had it all figured out back then.

43
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:13,475
But As I got older, I understood the parts I didn't understand before.

44
00:10:14,122 --> 00:10:16,280
I was very happy when I realized that.

45
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:19,424
I know how you feel

46
00:10:20,469 --> 00:10:26,319
I still don't understand any of it.

47
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,631
But lately

48
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:47,369
I think I knew what I was getting at when I was 15, 16, 17.

49
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:53,648
I feel I knew

50
00:10:59,225 --> 00:11:00,114
Tamako

51
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:01,481
Yeah

52
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:07,125
You need to stop being so negative.

53
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:09,316
Um

54
00:11:12,754 --> 00:11:14,599
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting

55
00:12:23,813 --> 00:12:24,565
Big brother?

56
00:12:30,922 --> 00:12:31,704
Takeguchi-san

57
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,637
Takeguchi-san

58
00:12:46,002 --> 00:12:46,920
Takeguchi-san

59
00:12:50,738 --> 00:12:52,057
Oh Eiji

60
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,654
Are you OK?

61
00:12:56,041 --> 00:13:00,562
I'm fine.
Our boss was killed

62
00:13:05,698 --> 00:13:06,938
Who did it?

63
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,911
I have no idea.
It was quick

64
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:18,178
There was a deal tonight.
Our boss was going to meet his girl on the way back home

65
00:13:18,754 --> 00:13:21,186
I was waiting for him outside

66
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:24,057
So I got injured

67
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:30,350
By the way
I need to ask you for a favor

68
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,975
Look at the bag there

69
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,387
Did you find it?

70
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,724
This?

71
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,237
Yeah

72
00:14:19,249 --> 00:14:20,333
What's inside?

73
00:14:21,056 --> 00:14:25,216
Guns.

74
00:14:30,011 --> 00:14:36,925
What are we doing with these them?
Better not caught up a gang warfare.

75
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,834
Don't freak out

76
00:14:42,534 --> 00:14:46,518
Take it easy.
Do what you always do.

77
00:14:52,261 --> 00:14:54,087
That's it

78
00:14:56,309 --> 00:14:59,444
It would be a waste if the police confiscated it.

79
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,266
This is a business, business you know?

80
00:15:08,705 --> 00:15:11,449
I'll call you later.
Go.

81
00:15:18,753 --> 00:15:26,683
30min...no.. Call police 15min later

82
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:32,328
30min or 1 hour

83
00:15:32,748 --> 00:15:35,521
I'll let the time pass me by

84
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,832
Are you OK?

85
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:39,847
You are drunker

86
00:15:39,974 --> 00:15:43,695
I'm ok.
I'm not drunk

87
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:47,943
By the way, your birthday is coming soon

88
00:15:48,988 --> 00:15:50,082
Not yet

89
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:53,070
Your birthday is end of August

90
00:15:53,197 --> 00:15:54,525
Really?

91
00:15:57,367 --> 00:16:00,404
Enjoy yourself

92
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:06,703
We know it's a little early, but let's celebrate your birthday.

93
00:16:40,434 --> 00:16:41,128
Eiji

94
00:16:42,993 --> 00:16:43,735
Hi

95
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:46,743
Are you working from now on?

96
00:16:47,094 --> 00:16:49,301
I've finished it

97
00:16:51,465 --> 00:16:53,291
The guest was gang

98
00:16:57,402 --> 00:16:58,594
ganster (yakuza)

99
00:16:58,994 --> 00:17:01,631
You should be careful

100
00:17:02,874 --> 00:17:03,577
See you

101
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:10,531
What the hell?

102
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:17,064
This is really bullshit

103
00:17:19,915 --> 00:17:22,699
Hello?
How are you?

104
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:26,605
I'm Hirosawa.
Please wait a min

105
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:28,851
From head office

106
00:17:30,267 --> 00:17:31,673
Hello?
I'm Ichido

107
00:17:35,443 --> 00:17:38,226
Sorry not yet

108
00:17:39,202 --> 00:17:42,884
We will take care of this

109
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:43,812
OK?

110
00:17:52,394 --> 00:17:54,464
Call Yoshimoto

111
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:06,564
I've managed it.
Can you bring us Takeguchi?

112
00:18:07,762 --> 00:18:11,492
I know.
I don't get involved in fighting

113
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:18,914
But A member of my crew was killed.
I am a President of Yakuza group

114
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,828
I'm trying to get closure.

115
00:18:25,675 --> 00:18:27,260
I'm counting on you

116
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:24,831
What would you like to drink?

117
00:19:25,725 --> 00:19:26,640
I want a beer

118
00:19:44,001 --> 00:19:45,452
Tamako

119
00:19:46,524 --> 00:19:48,254
What happened today?

120
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,831
I have a night adventure

121
00:19:50,954 --> 00:19:54,827
I also want to have a night adventure

122
00:19:55,173 --> 00:19:56,602
How are you?

123
00:19:57,137 --> 00:20:01,122
- You look fine, I have a gift for you
- What is it?

124
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:06,044
I used them for today's shoot

125
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
<i>To Eiji Nakai</i>

126
00:20:27,962 --> 00:20:30,406
How are you,Eiji

127
00:20:30,652 --> 00:20:32,928
I'm very fine

128
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,000
I am thinking about either you or Ichijo

129
00:20:43,395 --> 00:20:45,728
I'm talking about the next boss

130
00:20:47,302 --> 00:20:49,322
So tell me

131
00:20:51,186 --> 00:20:53,853
About the woman

132
00:20:56,688 --> 00:21:02,871
Only that woman knows that Amenishi (the killed boss) was there

133
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,737
So tell me about the woman

134
00:21:10,993 --> 00:21:14,910
Please tell me the age and fashion/outfits of this woman he was meeting

135
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,816
Tell me now

136
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:26,524
She is about 20 years old

137
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:30,698
She wore white clothes

138
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:34,079
She wore polka dot clothes

139
00:21:39,996 --> 00:21:42,206
She wore white trousers

140
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,815
She wore a hat

141
00:21:53,663 --> 00:21:54,991
She wore a hat?

142
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:57,000
Yes

143
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,181
Ouch

144
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,288
Wait!

145
00:22:20,148 --> 00:22:21,520
Wait!

146
00:22:22,149 --> 00:22:24,214
Please Wait!

147
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,756
It's rude not to apologize for pushing me away.

148
00:23:15,413 --> 00:23:18,237
What the hell are you doing?

149
00:23:25,464 --> 00:23:26,603
What do you mean?

150
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,143
Just take it

151
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:30,665
Say sorry

152
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,619
Just take it

153
00:23:32,964 --> 00:23:36,112
Who the hell are you?

154
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:41,781
You pretend you are great.
Who the hell are you then?

155
00:23:42,574 --> 00:23:45,386
Are you drunk?

156
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:18,826
Hey

157
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:23,101
Who the hell you think you are.
Why are you touching me.

158
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:41,355
Nice to meet you.
I'm Takeshi

159
00:24:42,582 --> 00:24:44,011
She's cute

160
00:24:44,424 --> 00:24:47,136
She's cute but strong

161
00:24:47,161 --> 00:24:49,309
A strong woman is nice

162
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:52,344
Watch out for him

163
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,894
He is such a nasty man

164
00:24:59,145 --> 00:25:01,813
That's business

165
00:25:03,208 --> 00:25:05,741
What kind of work do you do?

166
00:25:05,898 --> 00:25:09,904
I am in the service business of foreign transactions

167
00:25:11,165 --> 00:25:21,243
You're doing a serious job, right?
I thought you were a yakuza

168
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:24,023
Why do you laugh?

169
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:26,366
Welcome

170
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,877
Welcome

171
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,549
Parent company members are here.

172
00:25:36,182 --> 00:25:38,726
What kind of work do you do?

173
00:25:39,877 --> 00:25:41,975
You can guess

174
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,528
Well.. you're not student

175
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:56,423
Don't leave

176
00:25:59,742 --> 00:26:00,367
Hi

177
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,130
Is she your girl?

178
00:26:02,632 --> 00:26:03,502
Kind of

179
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:04,864
Something is strange

180
00:26:06,717 --> 00:26:08,291
Something is strange

181
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,757
Can you go out?

182
00:26:10,782 --> 00:26:12,387
I'm sorry

183
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:14,262
Do what I say

184
00:26:14,764 --> 00:26:16,539
Go to bathroom

185
00:26:16,564 --> 00:26:17,632
Why?

186
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:18,838
Go to bathroom

187
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:20,612
Why?

188
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,664
Hurry up

189
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,677
Wait

190
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,452
Don't move

191
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:43,904
Please make a line

192
00:26:44,013 --> 00:26:45,364
Get away!

193
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:49,640
You are violent and nice

194
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:51,656
Open!

195
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:14,616
I will charge you for the repair of the door.

196
00:27:17,518 --> 00:27:20,129
You knocked on the door very strongly

197
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:32,356
I'm leaving!

198
00:27:32,381 --> 00:27:34,800
I will charge you for the repair of the door.

199
00:27:53,161 --> 00:27:55,940
What the hell is this?

200
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:58,920
I have no idea
Anyway

201
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:04,322
Let's go

202
00:28:07,681 --> 00:28:09,076
Get your hand off me!

203
00:28:10,047 --> 00:28:12,034
That is easier to run

204
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:14,076
Are you good at running?

205
00:28:14,101 --> 00:28:16,821
I was a track and field athlete

206
00:28:16,846 --> 00:28:17,937
That's good

207
00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:26,251
It's been a long time since I run

208
00:28:34,553 --> 00:28:36,215
Do you feel good?

209
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,577
It's good

210
00:28:38,057 --> 00:28:41,763
You look painful

211
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:43,939
It's hard

212
00:28:43,964 --> 00:28:46,584
Because you are not exercising

213
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:48,147
I might be

214
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,531
Shit

215
00:28:56,378 --> 00:28:59,860
They seem to be jogging every morning

216
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:06,076
They are a new type of yakuza

217
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:42,952
They are so serious

218
00:29:43,153 --> 00:29:46,434
Why do I have to run away with you?

219
00:29:46,459 --> 00:29:47,673
I have no idea

220
00:29:47,698 --> 00:29:50,418
It seems they want to catch you

221
00:29:50,443 --> 00:29:51,434
Why?

222
00:29:56,822 --> 00:29:59,679
Let's meet later at the bar "Presso"

223
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,273
Let's break up into two

224
00:30:03,853 --> 00:30:06,119
You go first

225
00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:07,901
Go!

226
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,700
<i>Fireworks like life</i>

227
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,183
I get it.
Thank you for your hard work

228
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:24,628
please

229
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,389
I'll be here for a while

230
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:36,731
Ok finished.
Sorry for the inconvenience

231
00:35:37,579 --> 00:35:38,996
Not at all

232
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:42,662
I'm leaving

233
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:46,412
The woman seems to have been found

234
00:35:48,142 --> 00:35:50,630
The woman you were talking about

235
00:35:52,557 --> 00:35:53,595
I see

236
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,765
She was with a man named Eiji

237
00:35:58,137 --> 00:35:59,544
But she turned down

238
00:36:03,104 --> 00:36:03,974
Eiji?

239
00:36:04,878 --> 00:36:07,680
That bodyguard man

240
00:36:08,361 --> 00:36:11,463
Let us find them

241
00:36:14,633 --> 00:36:17,724
Bring him without killing him

242
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:21,420
Hey,let's go

243
00:36:22,893 --> 00:36:25,761
Don't worry.
Take a rest

244
00:36:36,752 --> 00:36:40,781
He's stupid, but why?

245
00:36:41,484 --> 00:36:43,895
Did it happen at 11 o'clock?

246
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:48,404
It happened for an hour and a half from 11:00

247
00:36:49,263 --> 00:36:50,401
I do not understand English

248
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,506
Excuse me

249
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:54,341
Please have a seat there

250
00:36:55,468 --> 00:37:02,366
Please tell us your name and profession

251
00:37:03,701 --> 00:37:08,779
Please tell us your name and profession

252
00:37:10,509 --> 00:37:14,538
We cannot make a record without that information

You slapped me twice a day

I will return this to you

264

Why did they chase us?

265

Don't do that

Why?

279

00:56:14,584 --> 00:56:15,901
- Really?
- Yes!

345
00:56:21,281 --> 00:56:22,665
Are you OK?

346
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:39,016
I had dreams

347
00:56:42,085 --> 00:56:44,641
I could hear the sound of wave

348
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:49,395
What dream you have?

349
00:56:52,898 --> 00:56:54,471
I forgot

350
00:56:58,590 --> 00:56:59,538
I want to smoke

351
00:56:59,851 --> 00:57:02,273
You shouldn't smoke

352
00:57:05,996 --> 00:57:07,101
Shall we drink?

353
00:57:09,534 --> 00:57:10,862
We can't

354
00:57:41,201 --> 00:57:43,042
Whois it? Eiji?

355
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:44,167
I had bad dream

356
01:00:09,461 --> 01:00:12,363
Chicken BBQ will be our breakfast

357
01:00:15,966 --> 01:00:17,239
You're nasty!

358
01:01:16,346 --> 01:01:18,243
I want to ask you for a favor

359
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:13,721
Yeah, I sent the key in the letter

360
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:18,375
Yeah, thanks

361
01:02:20,823 --> 01:02:23,736
I won't go but a jeep will pick you up

362
01:02:25,243 --> 01:02:31,091
Yeah, I didn't mean that

363
01:02:35,508 --> 01:02:37,081
Bye

364
01:02:47,934 --> 01:02:48,972
I want to ask you for a favor

365
01:02:53,771 --> 01:02:54,988
I get it

366
01:03:56,878 --> 01:04:04,758
<i>Let's change the local town with youngerster power</i>

367
01:04:20,592 --> 01:04:21,552
Don't you remember?

368
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:28,894
You were in a nightclub about a week ago

369
01:04:29,956 --> 01:04:31,049
Yeah

370
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:37,468
I was there too.
I was watching you

371
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:42,624
I was watching because I thought there was a pretty woman

372
01:04:43,425 --> 01:04:45,490
Thank you

373
01:04:48,458 --> 01:04:49,641
You are Geek

374
01:05:01,787 --> 01:05:06,598
I forgot to tell something to Eiji on the phone earlier.

375
01:05:07,200 --> 01:05:10,169
I am the woman of the murdered yakuza boss.

376
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:13,104
You?

377
01:05:13,316 --> 01:05:15,348
Yeah, that's incident

378
01:05:17,557 --> 01:05:21,586
Never tell anyone else.

379
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:24,086
Did you sleep with him?

380
01:05:25,057 --> 01:05:26,586
It's a business

381
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:31,743
It was a lot of fun today

382
01:05:32,412 --> 01:05:34,979
I'm very tired

383
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:37,892
They are too noisy

384
01:05:40,291 --> 01:05:41,943
How old are you?

385
01:05:42,959 --> 01:05:44,220
Do you want to know?

386
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:46,676
Yes

387
01:05:48,994 --> 01:05:49,954
I'm 15

388
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,729
If each pistol costs 500,000 yen, the total is 6,000,000 yen.

389
01:05:58,336 --> 01:05:59,463
It's big money

390
01:06:00,423 --> 01:06:02,733
It's a small amount of money for the yakuza today.

391
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:06,717
You know a lot

392
01:06:09,653 --> 01:06:11,651
You are also familiar with difficult characters, aren't you?

393
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:13,246
Don't say that

394
01:07:07,778 --> 01:07:09,374
I'm leaving tomorrow

395
01:07:14,642 --> 01:07:15,691
How can I call you?

396
01:07:25,857 --> 01:07:28,614
I'm new to being with a novelist

397
01:07:34,838 --> 01:07:36,054
How can I say

398
01:07:57,246 --> 01:07:58,117
Tomorrow?

399
01:08:01,476 --> 01:08:02,202
Yeah

400
01:08:18,113 --> 01:08:19,218
I see

401
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:25,792
How can I call you?

402
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:36,391
"You" is ok

403
01:08:49,007 --> 01:08:51,406
Are you really good cook?

404
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:55,007
I'm not a professional cook but I can cook

405
01:08:56,905 --> 01:08:59,115
Your injury got better

406
01:08:59,427 --> 01:09:00,610
How do you know that?

407
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,568
Because you talk so much

408
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:06,413
Don't be stupid

409
01:09:33,099 --> 01:09:34,695
Hello?
Yamaguchi company

410
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:37,742
Eiji?

411
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:42,106
Where are you now?

412
01:09:42,888 --> 01:09:44,417
You have to tell me something

413
01:09:47,441 --> 01:09:52,720
You send guys to attack me for some mistake?

414
01:09:55,633 --> 01:09:57,943
I trusted you

415
01:10:07,931 --> 01:10:15,387
I have come to hate the yakuza world.

416
01:10:19,601 --> 01:10:22,045
I get a pistol instead of a treatment table.

417
01:10:23,128 --> 01:10:25,572
Listen,Eiji

418
01:10:26,409 --> 01:10:31,788
Wait there before big problems occur

419
01:10:47,213 --> 01:10:51,610
<i>I will do my best for Shonan......</i>

420
01:10:56,610 --> 01:11:00,941
I've made up my mind

421
01:11:03,653 --> 01:11:05,070
I see

422
01:11:11,152 --> 01:11:14,489
I feel really sorry

423
01:12:14,829 --> 01:12:18,133
What the hell is he thinking?

424
01:12:36,406 --> 01:12:38,381
I'll eat a lot

425
01:12:42,287 --> 01:12:43,303
Come on

426
01:12:49,894 --> 01:12:51,032
Ta da

427
01:15:42,045 --> 01:15:47,413
It's like a different world here

428
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:58,981
I never thought this would happen

429
01:16:13,128 --> 01:16:14,188
Wait here

430
01:17:12,396 --> 01:17:20,197
Today, I read your novel while I was waiting

431
01:17:24,864 --> 01:17:30,121
I had never read a book that long in my life.

432
01:17:33,990 --> 01:17:35,195
How was it?

433
01:17:41,747 --> 01:17:43,075
How can I say

434
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:48,808
It was good

435
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,988
There were a lot of unreadable characters

436
01:18:34,338 --> 01:18:36,704
I'm a little tired

437
01:20:25,764 --> 01:20:26,679
Did you sleep?

438
01:20:39,494 --> 01:20:40,510
What?

439
01:20:41,525 --> 01:20:42,842
Can you open?

440
01:20:45,153 --> 01:20:50,242
I don't know you very well

441
01:20:52,072 --> 01:20:52,988
What?

442
01:21:05,190 --> 01:21:06,484
I have something I want to show you

443
01:21:12,549 --> 01:21:17,013
It's a gun with drugs in it.

444
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:22,080
If it's a transaction, it's two birds with one stone.

445
01:21:24,378 --> 01:21:26,041
So there was no pistol bullet

446
01:21:29,457 --> 01:21:30,886
Look, this

447
01:21:59,258 --> 01:22:06,546
He killed his boss and pistol whipped himself to make it look like a Yakuza war.

448
01:22:07,551 --> 01:22:11,412
He put the pistol in that bag

449
01:22:14,281 --> 01:22:18,711
Well, he thought it through.

450
01:22:20,658 --> 01:22:24,922
You are noisy and premature.

451
01:22:26,004 --> 01:22:29,598
You are just misunderstanding

452
01:22:51,752 --> 01:22:53,069
Eiji

453
01:24:05,716 --> 01:24:06,821
Takiguchi-san?

454
01:24:13,310 --> 01:24:14,649
Is that Takiguchi-san?

455
01:24:23,455 --> 01:24:25,274
Takiguchi!

456
01:24:37,993 --> 01:24:39,321
Come on!

457
01:24:39,779 --> 01:24:41,810
Stop it

458
01:28:11,623 --> 01:28:13,230
I can't see anything

459
01:28:17,304 --> 01:28:21,098
Is there anything that can make noises?

460
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:24,280
Only some fireworks

461
01:28:27,382 --> 01:28:28,230
Wait

462
01:28:56,468 --> 01:28:58,098
Open the window

463
01:28:58,123 --> 01:28:59,403
Why?

464
01:29:04,838 --> 01:29:05,976
Stay away

465
01:29:59,109 --> 01:30:01,129
Today is my birthday

466
01:30:01,408 --> 01:30:02,312
What?

467
01:30:02,535 --> 01:30:04,634
Today is my birthday

468
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:16,661
I hated birthdays since I was a kid

469
01:30:18,090 --> 01:30:28,502
My birthday is August 31st
It's the last day of summer vacation

470
01:30:29,942 --> 01:30:36,460
So no one comes to my birthday party

471
01:31:48,804 --> 01:31:49,730
I don't know......

472
01:31:50,132 --> 01:31:51,382
What?

473
01:31:55,735 --> 01:31:57,331
I don't know my birthday

474
01:32:01,516 --> 01:32:12,497
But women often ask me about my birthday.
I always give them a fake birthday.

475
01:32:14,426 --> 01:32:21,435
I find it very unpleasant to say that

476
01:35:32,210 --> 01:35:33,437
I didn't make it

477
01:36:03,462 --> 01:36:05,706
Why don't they attack us?

478
01:36:38,499 --> 01:36:40,117
Daybreak

479
01:36:43,912 --> 01:36:46,557
They are waiting for the daylight

480
01:37:01,984 --> 01:37:07,229
We can't do anything

481
01:37:28,241 --> 01:37:29,692
Help me

482
01:39:33,493 --> 01:39:34,207
Little more

483
01:39:38,504 --> 01:39:39,821
Little more

484
01:42:41,813 --> 01:42:44,090
Happy birthday

485
01:43:11,122 --> 01:43:12,807
I'll join your birthday party

486
01:43:20,095 --> 01:43:27,840
31st August will be my birthday from now on

487
01:43:41,503 --> 01:43:43,668
Happy birthday

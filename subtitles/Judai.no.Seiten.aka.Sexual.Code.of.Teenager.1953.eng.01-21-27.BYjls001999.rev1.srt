00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:21,046
The Sexual Code of the Teenager

3
00:01:45,344 --> 00:01:47,117
That's all, As I explained

4
00:01:48,016 --> 00:01:53,813
Women have a major role in human birth, from conception to birth.

5
00:01:55,117 --> 00:02:00,781
You are growing every day to become a mother

6
00:02:01,508 --> 00:02:06,883
So don't be afraid of this mission as a woman.

7
00:02:07,601 --> 00:02:10,343
You have to be solemn

8
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:17,875
Because you must carefully protect your virginity until marriage.

9
00:02:18,945 --> 00:02:24,672
You both need to understand this female physiology correctly in marriage and love.

10
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:31,430
You girls need to learn this important period of your life well.

11
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,133
Start!

12
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:44,172
Please turn your arm from the front

13
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:52,281
Takanashi-san!

14
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:04,562
Hey, Fukuoka,
Another cheat day, huh?

15
00:03:04,828 --> 00:03:07,312
What the hell you talk about?
It's a man's common sense

16
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:17,484
Stretch your arms forward

17
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:18,289
Start!

18
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:44,078
(A school song)

19
00:03:44,969 --> 00:03:49,180
Nishikawa-san.
If you feel sick, you can leave early.

20
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:50,758
I'm OK

21
00:04:06,133 --> 00:04:07,570
Excise start!

22
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:33,930
Hey! I saw it

23
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:06,156
Don't look so serious.
I won't tell it to anyone

24
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:23,758
Hey,Let me kiss you instead

25
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:24,242
No...

26
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,375
Why you afraid?

27
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,789
Let me do it for once.

28
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:40,258
What are you doing?

29
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,211
This is yours,right?

30
00:06:49,484 --> 00:06:50,047
Yes

31
00:06:51,258 --> 00:06:52,102
Do you know this?

32
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:52,719
No

33
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,977
This was in this wallet

34
00:06:59,922 --> 00:07:04,961
Eiko-san, I can't control my heart when I think of you

35
00:07:07,172 --> 00:07:09,859
You're on a high horse.

36
00:07:11,117 --> 00:07:13,016
In short, this is a love letter

37
00:07:14,578 --> 00:07:16,391
Who wrote this?

38
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,016
There is no name of the person who wrote this

39
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:21,461
Hey, you wrote this?

40
00:07:22,258 --> 00:07:23,992
No I haven't written the crap

41
00:07:24,023 --> 00:07:24,773
See?

42
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:27,031
Writing a love letter is crap

43
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:29,258
You confess directly

44
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:31,156
But I am...

45
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:32,445
You stupid!

46
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:40,828
What are you doing?

47
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:57,937
What's wrong, Eiko?

48
00:07:57,962 --> 00:08:02,547
Eiko is in great trouble,sister.
There is a man who put a love letter in her wallet

49
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,766
Teacher,
I am a thief

50
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:14,859
It ’s not good to blame yourself.

51
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:20,992
Anyway,You get head and stomach aches during your period.

52
00:08:22,547 --> 00:08:26,977
When your period is terrible, you unknowingly do strange things.

53
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:33,344
I also get frustrated during my period

54
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,773
Hey, you girls go home today

55
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,095
If you blame yourself forever, you will get sick.

56
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:58,845
I worry about it

57
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:01,478
I'm sorry

58
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,876
So cheer up, and go home

59
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:13,704
If you feel sick, please take a break from school tomorrow

60
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:19,259
She is coming!

61
00:09:25,158 --> 00:09:25,845
Eiko-san

62
00:09:25,993 --> 00:09:26,720
What?

63
00:09:27,556 --> 00:09:31,048
Ms Nishikawa seems to have stolen your purse

64
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,212
She didn't

65
00:09:33,634 --> 00:09:34,400
She didn't?

66
00:09:35,103 --> 00:09:39,345
She just picked up my purse and put it in her pocket

67
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:40,908
I see.
Is that so?

68
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:43,212
Okawa-san didn't say that

69
00:09:43,814 --> 00:09:45,884
Are you covering for her?

70
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,001
What do you think if that is true?

71
00:09:51,095 --> 00:09:52,243
Of course that's a problem

72
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:53,431
See?

73
00:09:53,814 --> 00:09:55,665
What are you doing looking for someone else's mistakes?

74
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,986
Do you think you should let bad things go?

75
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:03,923
God will not forgive you if she does something really bad

76
00:10:04,165 --> 00:10:06,986
Oh...you said God?

77
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,329
I don't want to talk to you girls

78
00:10:13,111 --> 00:10:13,806
Let's go

79
00:10:16,853 --> 00:10:18,751
They are lesbians

80
00:10:19,478 --> 00:10:23,947
God, acknowledge our justice.
Amen!

81
00:10:33,603 --> 00:10:34,283
Hey

82
00:10:45,322 --> 00:10:47,064
I feel sorry for Fusae

83
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:48,712
I think so

84
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:54,688
You are graduating soon,sister

85
00:10:56,774 --> 00:10:58,165
I feel sad

86
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,181
I will always see you after graduation.

87
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:02,352
But....

88
00:11:03,423 --> 00:11:06,579
You will get married someday, right?

89
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:12,688
I have a grudge against a man who marries you

90
00:11:13,892 --> 00:11:14,806
Don't say stupid things

91
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:29,892
Please eat this,sister

92
00:11:30,798 --> 00:11:31,634
Thanks

93
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:24,529
It doesn't matter if it's a little time, so please come visit us

94
00:12:24,554 --> 00:12:27,060
Sorry,I have a plan

95
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,592
Ok, you are good girl

96
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:31,583
No...

97
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,435
Let's say good bye here

98
00:12:35,349 --> 00:12:35,842
See you

99
00:12:37,295 --> 00:12:37,888
Bye

100
00:12:43,131 --> 00:12:43,935
Sister

101
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:49,029
I sweated my hands

102
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:39,240
You've been waiting for me?

103
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,287
I've been working on this painting.

104
00:13:46,013 --> 00:13:47,092
Let's go

105
00:13:47,584 --> 00:13:49,779
I told my mother that I would go to a concert with my friends

106
00:13:50,623 --> 00:13:53,763
I told my dad that last night too

107
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:54,724
Let's go

108
00:14:06,162 --> 00:14:07,342
That line is funny.

109
00:14:08,092 --> 00:14:11,795
You're on a high horse,Eiko-san

110
00:14:12,256 --> 00:14:14,045
Don't say bullshit

111
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,287
It's not your business

112
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:18,834
Oh, she is coming

113
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:23,795
Hey, Princess

114
00:14:24,373 --> 00:14:24,935
Get out of the way

115
00:14:25,318 --> 00:14:26,271
You are scary

116
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:31,873
Hey, Princess

117
00:14:32,232 --> 00:14:33,272
Hey, Princess

118
00:14:33,591 --> 00:14:35,372
You're on a high horse

119
00:14:35,482 --> 00:14:36,115
Hey

120
00:14:36,576 --> 00:14:37,099
Stop doing it

121
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,412
What the hell?

122
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:39,677
That's bad

123
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,248
It's not good to make fun of girls

124
00:14:43,092 --> 00:14:44,045
it's cool

125
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:46,490
I get it

126
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,107
You are the one who wrote the love letter

127
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:51,568
I'm not

128
00:14:51,888 --> 00:14:52,607
You are lair

129
00:14:52,873 --> 00:14:54,006
I'm not that for sure

130
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:56,826
Oh

131
00:14:59,084 --> 00:14:59,818
Come on

132
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,482
You go home

133
00:15:09,162 --> 00:15:09,982
Fuck you

134
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:10,740
Damn it

135
00:15:11,498 --> 00:15:12,303
Stop it

136
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,810
Let me go

137
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,232
My body is defiled.

138
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,724
I am a woman without shame.

139
00:16:43,982 --> 00:16:44,865
Awwww!

140
00:17:17,693 --> 00:17:19,185
Did you get angry with me?

141
00:17:43,287 --> 00:17:43,888
Stop it

142
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:46,896
Let's go home

143
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:55,248
Hi, Nitta

144
00:17:55,857 --> 00:17:56,404
Hi

145
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:57,825
You're still drawing, aren't you?

146
00:17:59,021 --> 00:17:59,919
I will introduce you someone

147
00:18:00,732 --> 00:18:03,584
This is Ms. Nakatsugawa who is in an art school

148
00:18:06,068 --> 00:18:08,240
This is my art friend Nitta

149
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,115
Nice to meet you

150
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:12,685
You can introduce her too

151
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,810
Ah..this is Kaoru Mitani

152
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:16,646
Nice to meet you

153
00:18:19,099 --> 00:18:22,201
We're going to have a party at home from now on, so why don't you come?

154
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,193
Sorry, I need to go

155
00:18:29,592 --> 00:18:30,537
How about you?

156
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,724
I'll see her off, sorry

157
00:18:43,404 --> 00:18:44,482
You stupid!

158
00:19:00,334 --> 00:19:02,958
Oh you, don't play the bell

159
00:19:04,123 --> 00:19:04,779
Who play the bell?

160
00:19:07,326 --> 00:19:07,787
Oh

161
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:09,084
It was not me

162
00:19:14,881 --> 00:19:16,036
You stupid!

163
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,818
Don't quarrel

164
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,685
You are terrible,sister

165
00:19:51,654 --> 00:19:53,412
What's wrong, Eiko?

166
00:19:53,974 --> 00:19:54,888
I'm fine

167
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:57,239
I brought some sweets

168
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,076
I don't want

169
00:19:58,521 --> 00:19:59,646
It's very delicious

170
00:20:00,146 --> 00:20:01,123
Leave it there

171
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:02,943
You are strange

172
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:18,623
Welcome back

173
00:20:20,396 --> 00:20:21,396
Welcome back

174
00:20:23,404 --> 00:20:25,974
Do not eat sweets before meals

175
00:20:30,162 --> 00:20:31,381
Give this to Eiko

176
00:20:31,482 --> 00:20:35,568
I brought some sweets for her but
She locked the door

177
00:20:36,388 --> 00:20:37,638
She is strange

178
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:38,748
You shouldn't go

179
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:39,459
What?

180
00:20:39,484 --> 00:20:40,388
It's pointless

181
00:20:40,662 --> 00:20:41,287
Why?

182
00:20:41,584 --> 00:20:43,201
She's frustrated

183
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,623
I don't like you!

184
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:52,326
I want to hit that guy's friend

185
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:54,021
And I'll kick his ass

186
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,529
What is she doing?

187
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,403
She's frustrated

188
00:20:58,638 --> 00:20:59,381
I see

189
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,131
She is becoming an adult

190
00:21:06,638 --> 00:21:09,849
She's a woman of her age.

191
00:21:10,224 --> 00:21:13,045
I see, I get it

192
00:21:17,537 --> 00:21:18,240
No

193
00:21:51,967 --> 00:21:56,670
Which do you like better, me or him?

194
00:21:57,286 --> 00:21:58,193
Tell me

195
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:06,357
Are you still upset?

196
00:22:06,936 --> 00:22:07,717
No

197
00:22:09,178 --> 00:22:11,076
Don't do that again

198
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:11,811
OK

199
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,115
I'm leaving here

200
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:20,694
Thanks

201
00:22:25,326 --> 00:22:25,936
Kaoru-san

202
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:01,709
God, why can't I shake hands obediently?

203
00:23:03,397 --> 00:23:06,030
I'm scared of my body once polluted

204
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:10,959
I'm scared if he knows my secret

205
00:23:12,186 --> 00:23:14,069
I'm so scared to live

206
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:19,280
But I really love him

207
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:22,319
What should I do?

208
00:23:23,764 --> 00:23:24,990
Please tell me

209
00:23:38,459 --> 00:23:41,186
Fusae,
Are you sick?

210
00:23:41,756 --> 00:23:43,522
I'm fine

211
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:46,389
I have an English exam today so I'm short of sleep

212
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,740
Oh I see

213
00:23:47,765 --> 00:23:48,326
Good morning

214
00:23:48,365 --> 00:23:48,849
Good morning

215
00:23:49,381 --> 00:23:49,998
Are you going out?

216
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:52,014
I have an English exam today

217
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:52,944
I see

218
00:24:03,053 --> 00:24:03,756
Letter for you

219
00:24:04,022 --> 00:24:04,553
From who

220
00:24:04,655 --> 00:24:05,608
There is no sender's name

221
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:06,826
I'm going

222
00:24:13,928 --> 00:24:18,569
Eiko-san,
I repeatedly wrote your name on a piece of paper and then tore it up.

223
00:24:19,194 --> 00:24:22,350
But I wrote you this second letter

224
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:30,186
The last letter I wrote was laughed at by my male friends.

225
00:24:32,475 --> 00:24:36,865
I apologize for the inconvenience to you

226
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,881
I was sorry

227
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:45,201
I'm waiting for you in front of the workshop room for today's lunch break

228
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,256
Please be sure to come

229
00:24:48,944 --> 00:24:49,780
Oh my god

230
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,030
What the hell?
Watch out!

231
00:25:16,764 --> 00:25:17,334
Hey

232
00:25:21,397 --> 00:25:22,014
Kudo

233
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,553
You sent this to Takanashi?

234
00:25:29,584 --> 00:25:32,061
You wrote this love letter?

235
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:38,209
Why can't the person who writes this answer reply?

236
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,709
Sorry I wrote it

237
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:41,483
I wrote it

238
00:25:42,381 --> 00:25:43,444
Don't you think it's bad?

239
00:25:43,561 --> 00:25:44,209
No

240
00:25:45,037 --> 00:25:46,561
I thought I would meet her and apologize

241
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:47,475
You sure?

242
00:25:47,936 --> 00:25:48,842
Yes

243
00:25:50,553 --> 00:25:52,381
If true, this is forbidden.

244
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:04,139
Kudo-san

245
00:27:17,944 --> 00:27:18,498
Ah!

246
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:50,256
Hey,Nishikawa

247
00:27:50,865 --> 00:27:52,662
You didn't come to school today

248
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,428
Where did you take a break from school and play?

249
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:00,733
Sorry for the last time

250
00:28:01,233 --> 00:28:03,475
I apologize for the inconvenience to you.
Forgive me

251
00:28:03,951 --> 00:28:04,350
Right?

252
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:05,701
Don't touch me

253
00:28:06,373 --> 00:28:08,873
What the hell, Thief woman

254
00:28:11,436 --> 00:28:12,052
Stop it!

255
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:12,655
Nishikawa-san

256
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
Stop it

257
00:28:14,647 --> 00:28:15,584
What's wrong with you?

258
00:28:23,561 --> 00:28:25,514
It's not nice to bully a girl.

259
00:28:25,944 --> 00:28:26,905
I didn't

260
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,092
Please wait until tomorrow

261
00:29:09,108 --> 00:29:09,881
I'm back

262
00:29:09,906 --> 00:29:10,452
Welcome back

263
00:29:13,858 --> 00:29:18,303
Right now, it's exam time at my daughter's school.

264
00:29:19,053 --> 00:29:24,092
If the electricity is cut off, my daughter won't be able to study.

265
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:25,553
So please

266
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:28,577
I'm in trouble

267
00:29:29,288 --> 00:29:34,678
If you have the money to send your daughter to school, you will pay the electricity bill, right?

268
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:38,288
So please pay it today

269
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:40,342
I told you I'll pay tomorrow

270
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:42,741
I'm not saying I won't pay

271
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:54,045
So please

272
00:29:54,264 --> 00:29:55,384
I'm in trouble

273
00:29:55,749 --> 00:29:56,608
Please

274
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:57,272
Dad

275
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:05,014
What happened to this money?

276
00:30:05,374 --> 00:30:06,585
I've saved money

277
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:07,913
Oh

278
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:12,280
So I'll borrow this

279
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:13,381
Take it

280
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,225
She's a good daughter,right?

281
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:20,279
She is studying in high school

282
00:30:20,342 --> 00:30:21,138
I see

283
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,936
She is currently in the exam

284
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:29,014
Please do your best to study

285
00:30:33,647 --> 00:30:37,545
He changed his attitude when he took the money

286
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:38,866
Right?

287
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,608
I'm sorry to worry you

288
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:47,241
I'll get the money back to you as soon as I can.

289
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,749
My business is not doing so well these days.

290
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:55,233
I have shamed you

291
00:30:56,225 --> 00:30:57,085
Never mind

292
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:03,085
You should study hard and graduate.

293
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:05,631
I'm proud of you

294
00:31:09,194 --> 00:31:12,077
Then I'm leaving here,
Say hi to your parents

295
00:31:12,102 --> 00:31:12,991
Thanks

296
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,233
Sorry to keep you waiting

297
00:31:19,436 --> 00:31:20,022
Depart

298
00:31:27,045 --> 00:31:28,225
Hi,Nitta

299
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,600
How are you?

300
00:31:31,702 --> 00:31:32,311
Good

301
00:31:32,506 --> 00:31:35,217
Do you have time today?

302
00:31:36,053 --> 00:31:36,585
Will you come?

303
00:31:37,069 --> 00:31:38,374
She has left

304
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:40,178
We are not lover

305
00:31:40,203 --> 00:31:42,522
That ’s okay, right?

306
00:31:43,186 --> 00:31:43,803
Let's go

307
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:52,077
I'll go to our factory

308
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:54,256
You can go to sleep

309
00:31:54,538 --> 00:31:55,397
You will be late?

310
00:31:55,733 --> 00:31:56,233
Huh?

311
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,295
Well....

312
00:32:02,577 --> 00:32:05,467
Anyway, our factory is no longer good

313
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:10,459
My father says he'll shut down the factory and see how things go for a while.

314
00:32:11,522 --> 00:32:12,983
But I have to work

315
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:15,006
You will be unemployed

316
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:15,413
Um

317
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,366
Don't worry about us

318
00:32:20,491 --> 00:32:23,655
I'll still talk to him.

319
00:32:24,678 --> 00:32:27,170
So don't worry about it, just study.

320
00:32:38,069 --> 00:32:38,733
Refill

321
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,999
Cut it out.
It's already the 7th cup

322
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:42,233
Refill

323
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:44,631
Scold him

324
00:32:44,656 --> 00:32:46,077
Your stomach will explode

325
00:32:49,952 --> 00:32:51,108
A visitor has come

326
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:52,061
Hi

327
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:55,717
Is Eiko in?

328
00:32:55,795 --> 00:32:56,225
Yes

329
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:58,030
A visitor has come for you,Eiko sis

330
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,991
Sorry for the last time

331
00:33:14,428 --> 00:33:19,889
6,7,8,

332
00:33:23,991 --> 00:33:25,288
I won 10,000yen

333
00:33:27,952 --> 00:33:28,960
Tome-san is here?

334
00:33:30,288 --> 00:33:32,561
He just went to their factory

335
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:33,788
Oh I see

336
00:33:57,647 --> 00:33:59,740
Woman arrested for running away with 700,000 yen

337
00:34:25,374 --> 00:34:28,624
I get it.
You only drink gin, so it's called bar-gin.

338
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:29,420
Yes

339
00:34:29,897 --> 00:34:32,694
It's a pretty fashionable name

340
00:34:33,663 --> 00:34:35,444
It ’s a really honest sign.

341
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:38,225
You are a business person

342
00:34:38,725 --> 00:34:39,256
Anyway

343
00:34:40,374 --> 00:34:43,077
You think a virgin woman is attractive?

344
00:34:43,303 --> 00:34:44,061
I don't know

345
00:34:44,413 --> 00:34:44,967
How about you?

346
00:34:45,241 --> 00:34:46,194
It's strange

347
00:34:46,663 --> 00:34:47,491
How about you,Nitta?

348
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,694
What if you marry a virgin female

349
00:34:53,585 --> 00:34:54,186
Well...

350
00:34:56,124 --> 00:34:57,061
You don't care?

351
00:34:57,694 --> 00:35:00,569
Of course I care

352
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:02,983
You like virgins

353
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:05,553
Is Virginity Important for Men?

354
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,069
Of course

355
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,874
You think so?

356
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:12,170
I don't care about that

357
00:35:12,366 --> 00:35:13,147
I care

358
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:17,210
So I can get married in a matchmaking

359
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:20,131
The virginity is the most important thing for you?

360
00:35:20,264 --> 00:35:20,928
Not

361
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:21,733
But

362
00:35:21,758 --> 00:35:25,366
I have to be a virgin to be your wife?

363
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:46,530
Thank you very much

364
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:05,678
I want another Gin

365
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:06,358
Sure

366
00:36:08,811 --> 00:36:10,889
You don't have to go to Bank?

367
00:36:11,327 --> 00:36:12,733
I asked my sister

368
00:36:13,163 --> 00:36:13,952
I want another Gin too

369
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:15,092
me too

370
00:36:16,358 --> 00:36:17,014
How about you,Nitta?

371
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,155
I can't drink Gin, that's too strong

372
00:36:18,881 --> 00:36:19,897
So beer OK?

373
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:20,585
Kind of

374
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,639
Can we have beers?

375
00:36:22,702 --> 00:36:24,670
There are only Gins here

376
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:25,624
No beers?

377
00:36:26,561 --> 00:36:28,233
Then put a lot of ice on JIN

378
00:36:28,749 --> 00:36:31,678
Oh yeah,
Why don't you go skating during spring break?

379
00:36:46,186 --> 00:36:48,569
That man had a lot of 1000 yen bills

380
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:51,920
But the man was very stingy

381
00:36:52,866 --> 00:36:53,538
Excuse me

382
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:55,913
Can I ask you something?

383
00:36:57,249 --> 00:37:00,030
Can I work with you?

384
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,710
You can do something different than sell the flowers

385
00:37:04,303 --> 00:37:05,530
You can do something different

386
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:06,827
Anything ok

387
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,022
Good luck

388
00:37:48,561 --> 00:37:49,670
Oh sorry

389
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:04,108
What the hell?
Do you have any complaints?

390
00:38:05,538 --> 00:38:07,264
Don't be so upset

391
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:10,350


392
00:38:08,474 --> 00:38:10,607
I'm not bar girl.
I'm a fish shop

393
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:14,139
If you want to touch woman's boobs, why don't you go to that shop?

394
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:16,514
please calm down.
Forgive him

395
00:38:16,928 --> 00:38:20,452
I'm so upset.
If you do next time, I will hit you

396
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:22,795
So you should be careful

397
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:24,366
I was sorry

398
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:29,061
This is not a spectacle.
Go home everyone

399
00:38:31,264 --> 00:38:32,600
Oh Fusae

400
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,592
Long time no see

401
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,350
Oh Makiko-san

402
00:38:35,405 --> 00:38:36,342
You look fine as usual

403
00:38:36,889 --> 00:38:37,686
Did you see?

404
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:38,600
I did it little

405
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,499
This is not a spectacle.

406
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:49,397
I don't have parents, so I have to be strong

407
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:50,866
You are great

408
00:38:50,952 --> 00:38:52,678
I'm not

409
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:57,452
I was jealous of you girls going to high school when you graduated from junior high school

410
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,256
But I'm not jealous of you

411
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,475
Working is fun even at fish shop

412
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:02,967
Do I look good?

413
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:05,006
I'm cute,right?

414
00:39:05,686 --> 00:39:08,710
What? She stole a purse?

415
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:12,491
I don't mean that

416
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:14,686
But...

417
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:16,467
I see...

418
00:39:24,936 --> 00:39:30,358
It's something that women have when they're not feeling well, a seizure.

419
00:39:52,691 --> 00:39:56,394
Teacher...I thought about it

420
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,167
I think I know what it is.

421
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:00,238
Eh?

422
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,058
Last night she had 1000 yen for some reason

423
00:40:08,745 --> 00:40:10,011
Oh....

424
00:40:10,058 --> 00:40:12,667
She said she saved money but it's strange

425
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,081
Women have a lot of problems.

426
00:40:19,106 --> 00:40:20,097
No way

427
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,613
As you can see, We are so poor

428
00:40:26,066 --> 00:40:27,808
She doesn't have that money for sure

429
00:40:30,675 --> 00:40:31,675
Teacher...

430
00:40:32,886 --> 00:40:38,316
It ’s the will of a dead my wife.
She want her to graduate from high school even if we are poor

431
00:40:39,253 --> 00:40:41,355
And yet, this is what happened.

432
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:42,816
Don't think too much

433
00:40:44,011 --> 00:40:47,620
Really she is shameless

434
00:40:48,714 --> 00:40:53,378
She might be skipping school to hang out.

435
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:02,519
Anyway, she's a sensitive time

436
00:41:04,019 --> 00:41:05,885
That is especially true during menstruation.

437
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,331
No..whatever you say

438
00:41:09,253 --> 00:41:10,456
She is a thief

439
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:13,269
Really she is shameless

440
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:15,644
Don't say that

441
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,956
I'll kick her out when she comes back

442
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:53,722
I'm about to catch a cold

443
00:41:54,448 --> 00:41:55,308
Please finish early

444
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:57,300
Only 20 minutes have passed

445
00:41:57,753 --> 00:41:58,300
Not yet

446
00:41:59,066 --> 00:42:00,136
It's your turn, today

447
00:42:00,846 --> 00:42:02,549
Give me a break!

448
00:42:02,706 --> 00:42:03,276
Not yet

449
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:14,394
Are you studying?

450
00:42:15,159 --> 00:42:16,636
When did you come back?

451
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:17,652
Just now

452
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:18,948
Welcome back

453
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:21,628
But I'm only in Tokyo today and tomorrow

454
00:42:22,284 --> 00:42:24,027
That's bad

455
00:42:24,394 --> 00:42:25,839
Please wait for a whole

456
00:42:26,347 --> 00:42:28,534
My work will be done soon.

457
00:42:29,456 --> 00:42:30,855
I can't wait

458
00:42:33,823 --> 00:42:37,175
But it can't be helped.
You have your life

459
00:42:37,402 --> 00:42:40,128
Oh, you are good girl,today

460
00:42:40,363 --> 00:42:40,777
Yes

461
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:42,659
You want reward, right?

462
00:42:43,245 --> 00:42:44,159
Yes

463
00:42:50,347 --> 00:42:51,909
Here is your reward

464
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:53,058
I want more

465
00:42:55,081 --> 00:42:58,402
I'll transfer some money to your bank account.
so Don't waste money

466
00:42:58,441 --> 00:42:59,167
Sure!

467
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:02,581
Then see you guys

468
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:04,488
Enjoy your work

469
00:43:11,331 --> 00:43:12,441
Hey Oda!

470
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,925
That's not fair

471
00:43:15,464 --> 00:43:17,456
I don't want to be naked in front of visitor

472
00:43:17,777 --> 00:43:20,027
Don't make excuses.
Be naked!

473
00:43:20,052 --> 00:43:21,065
Give me a break

474
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:21,558
No

475
00:43:22,238 --> 00:43:25,206
Please share me the money you got from him

476
00:43:29,214 --> 00:43:30,339
What kind of pose you like?

477
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:32,597
Nude

478
00:43:33,855 --> 00:43:35,003
Yes nude!

479
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:35,878
nude!

480
00:43:36,292 --> 00:43:37,480
Ok decided!

481
00:43:39,261 --> 00:43:40,527
I'll try it!

482
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:47,378
Then just draw my face.

483
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,292
OK

484
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:02,331
Are you excited,Nitta?

485
00:44:02,964 --> 00:44:03,628
Kind of

486
00:44:06,433 --> 00:44:07,925
Get ready for drawing

487
00:44:14,909 --> 00:44:16,519
Turn around, everyone

488
00:44:16,855 --> 00:44:17,667
Close your eyes

489
00:44:31,691 --> 00:44:34,206
1,2,3 then open your eyes

490
00:44:34,925 --> 00:44:35,315
Okay?

491
00:44:38,245 --> 00:44:40,738
1,2,3

492
00:46:02,441 --> 00:46:06,816
Will you still play with me when you go to college?

493
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:08,855
Sure,Eiko

494
00:46:09,886 --> 00:46:11,847
Please do your best for another year

495
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:13,675
Why?

496
00:46:14,784 --> 00:46:16,847
I'll go to college with you.

497
00:46:17,277 --> 00:46:18,847
I see.
I'm glad

498
00:46:20,276 --> 00:46:23,370


499
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:26,589


500
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:28,495
I'm glad

501
00:46:29,675 --> 00:46:32,714
But sorry I have a plan tonight

502
00:46:35,714 --> 00:46:36,549
I'm sorry

503
00:46:37,886 --> 00:46:41,964
My friend is celebrating my graduation

504
00:46:42,815 --> 00:46:46,214
Your friends are adults, right?

505
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:47,565
Yes

506
00:46:49,089 --> 00:46:50,190
There are also men,right?

507
00:46:51,659 --> 00:46:52,753
I'm sorry

508
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,269
I thought it was rude to refuse

509
00:46:56,144 --> 00:46:56,706
I'm jealous

510
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,026
Congratulations on your graduation,Kaoru-san

511
00:47:14,628 --> 00:47:15,800
I can't drink

512
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:17,753
It's Ok,
Right, Nitta

513
00:47:17,893 --> 00:47:18,698
She can't drink

514
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:24,862
Shall we leave now?

515
00:47:25,659 --> 00:47:28,597
Are you going home?

516
00:47:33,847 --> 00:47:34,800
Are you going home?

517
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,206
Yes, See you

518
00:47:42,097 --> 00:47:44,534
See you tomorrow in Shinjuku

519
00:48:19,089 --> 00:48:20,096
Thanks for today

520
00:48:20,511 --> 00:48:20,948
Thanks

521
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:21,948
good night

522
00:48:22,308 --> 00:48:22,948
See you

523
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:06,323
God, I'm a dirty girl.

524
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:09,128
I am not qualified to be loved

525
00:49:10,534 --> 00:49:11,870
Even so

526
00:49:12,386 --> 00:49:15,050
I forgot myself and God

527
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:18,221
I've made another sin.

528
00:49:26,058 --> 00:49:28,995
Oh....you are here

529
00:49:31,261 --> 00:49:34,315
Dad...I'm a bad girl

530
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,456
What's wrong?

531
00:49:36,948 --> 00:49:40,276
I can't accept people's feelings obediently

532
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:46,050
I sometimes quarrel with my wife

533
00:49:46,479 --> 00:49:49,042
It ’s not that easy.

534
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:51,854
I thought you had a quarrel with Nitta

535
00:49:53,651 --> 00:49:54,847
I'm not in a quarrel with him

536
00:49:55,558 --> 00:49:57,565
Don't worry

537
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,214
People who grow up without being loved will eventually love people

538
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:06,784
Listen,
You are already growing

539
00:50:09,183 --> 00:50:10,065
Did something strange happen?

540
00:50:14,417 --> 00:50:15,136
That's fine

541
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:17,917
The body is weak

542
00:50:19,495 --> 00:50:22,620
You have to value purity

543
00:50:37,711 --> 00:50:41,508
We can't hire someone without a guarantor

544
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,312
So her guarantor is me

545
00:50:44,992 --> 00:50:45,875
Am I good enough?

546
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:50,328
I'm working properly

547
00:50:50,836 --> 00:50:54,289
I have a lot of friends

548
00:50:54,977 --> 00:50:56,273
So Please hire her

549
00:50:56,641 --> 00:50:59,266
I'll sell you fish cheaply

550
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:02,641
Please

551
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:03,750
OK?

552
00:51:05,117 --> 00:51:06,109
You are good man

553
00:51:06,914 --> 00:51:08,570
So please

554
00:51:10,289 --> 00:51:12,336
It can't be helped

555
00:51:13,586 --> 00:51:14,203
Ok I'll hire her

556
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,430
So you should work here for a while

557
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:19,859
Work is hard

558
00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:22,711
I respect you

559
00:51:24,016 --> 00:51:25,547
That's good for you

560
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:38,070
By the way, I don't have a little money, so please lend me 1000 yen.

561
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:39,023
What?

562
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,305
What the hell you talk about?

563
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,211
You are good man.
I'll sell you fish cheaply

564
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:47,734
It can't be helped

565
00:51:51,945 --> 00:51:52,586
Thank you

566
00:51:53,617 --> 00:51:56,265
You should repay with this money

567
00:51:58,594 --> 00:51:59,250
Thank you

568
00:52:01,406 --> 00:52:03,180
Ok we have done

569
00:52:03,812 --> 00:52:04,711
Oh yeah

570
00:52:05,812 --> 00:52:09,180
It's not a thank you, but I'm giving this to you.

571
00:52:09,539 --> 00:52:10,023
Eh?

572
00:53:38,477 --> 00:53:39,093
Ah!

573
00:54:15,406 --> 00:54:16,765
You're going to play tennis?

574
00:54:16,867 --> 00:54:17,219
Yes

575
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:18,484
I want to play too

576
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:20,930
No,
I'll play with sister

577
00:54:21,515 --> 00:54:23,922
That's Ok.
You play at school?

578
00:54:24,617 --> 00:54:26,648
Um,
You go ahead and get ready.

579
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:27,242
Okay

580
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:50,289
The more I love that person, the more scared I am.
I'd rather not to go for skate

581
00:55:06,852 --> 00:55:08,375
Would you like to play tennis together?

582
00:55:11,594 --> 00:55:12,219
Please

583
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:43,875
I'm sorry

584
00:55:50,664 --> 00:55:52,516
What's wrong with you?

585
00:55:55,937 --> 00:55:59,016
Actually I had a plan today

586
00:56:00,641 --> 00:56:01,656
Did you intend to go somewhere?

587
00:56:03,594 --> 00:56:06,367
I was going to skate on the lake

588
00:56:07,617 --> 00:56:08,789
With Nitta-san too?

589
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:09,921
Yes

590
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:14,211
I feel lonely

591
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:25,828
Ok, you can go

592
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,289
But you have to come home soon.

593
00:56:32,164 --> 00:56:33,258
Please also buy souvenirs for me

594
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,648
What's wrong with Kaoru?

595
00:56:37,773 --> 00:56:40,344
Did you do anything wrong with her?

596
00:56:41,555 --> 00:56:42,359
Give me a break

597
00:56:42,977 --> 00:56:43,852
I guess so

598
00:56:44,992 --> 00:56:46,328
She is not like you

599
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,680
What do you mean?

600
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:50,320
Please stop talking bad about her.

601
00:56:50,672 --> 00:56:52,219
She's probably a virgin

602
00:56:53,086 --> 00:56:54,086
She is not like me

603
00:56:56,187 --> 00:56:57,844
Kaoru has already graduated

604
00:56:58,922 --> 00:57:01,633
It's more fun for her to play with him than to play with you

605
00:57:02,703 --> 00:57:05,047
Love is delicate

606
00:57:06,227 --> 00:57:09,453
I hate people who pretend to be adults.

607
00:57:10,164 --> 00:57:11,680
We are already adults

608
00:57:14,078 --> 00:57:15,836
I'm not an adult yet

609
00:57:16,852 --> 00:57:19,882
You don't know?
I'll show you this

610
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,234
You are dirty

611
00:57:42,875 --> 00:57:44,531
Why did I come?

612
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:49,336
I'm starting to go against my own mind.

613
00:57:50,453 --> 00:57:51,625
I don't even know

614
00:58:46,086 --> 00:58:47,820
They are skating good

615
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:50,773
Ouch!

616
00:59:11,016 --> 00:59:12,758
Ah! Kaoru-san!

617
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:24,453
Thank you for coming

618
00:59:24,836 --> 00:59:25,211
Yes

619
00:59:25,898 --> 00:59:27,156
Oh She has come

620
00:59:43,453 --> 00:59:44,742
Let's skating

621
00:59:44,883 --> 00:59:45,328
OK

622
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:49,835
Ah..I'm tired

623
01:00:50,109 --> 01:00:51,117
Let's go home

624
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,523
We practice a little more and go home

625
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:54,109
I see

626
01:00:54,641 --> 01:00:55,117
Bye

627
01:00:55,914 --> 01:00:56,273
Bye

628
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:50,523
Skate alone this time.

629
01:01:50,602 --> 01:01:51,180
I'll try

630
01:01:53,204 --> 01:01:53,704
Go

631
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,993
Oh, it's bloody

632
01:03:32,563 --> 01:03:33,313
We can't

633
01:03:46,094 --> 01:03:46,868
No....

634
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:51,211
No....

635
01:03:58,352 --> 01:04:00,368
I love you but

636
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,665
No..stop it

637
01:04:11,704 --> 01:04:14,657
I love you so much

638
01:04:16,516 --> 01:04:17,172
No...

639
01:04:19,571 --> 01:04:20,141
Stop it

640
01:04:32,852 --> 01:04:33,563
kaoru-san

641
01:04:49,313 --> 01:04:50,047
I saw it

642
01:04:58,790 --> 01:04:59,375
Get out of here

643
01:04:59,400 --> 01:04:59,790
No

644
01:05:00,187 --> 01:05:01,781
No way

645
01:05:02,133 --> 01:05:03,039
I'll tell everyone when you make a noise

646
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,977
It ’s also bad for Kaoru-san.

647
01:05:07,977 --> 01:05:08,719
Don't worry

648
01:05:12,875 --> 01:05:16,461
It's cold outside.
She can't stay outside for a long time

649
01:05:30,688 --> 01:05:34,110
I wonder if she love you for sure

650
01:05:49,118 --> 01:05:49,750
Nitta-san

651
01:05:52,211 --> 01:05:53,516
I like you

652
01:05:58,188 --> 01:05:59,665
I've loved you since the first time I met you

653
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:04,110
I love you

654
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:26,422
I'm going to be abandoned by God.

655
01:08:34,797 --> 01:08:37,032
Hello?

656
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:39,172
Hello?

657
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,492
Hello?

658
01:08:50,696 --> 01:08:53,000
Hello?

659
01:08:53,571 --> 01:08:55,773
Hello?

660
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:04,305
Hello?

661
01:09:06,938 --> 01:09:07,985
Let's go there

662
01:09:23,266 --> 01:09:24,024
Let's go over there

663
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:02,852
You caught a cold

664
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:04,665
I'm sorry.

665
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:06,758
Because you were outside in the middle of the night

666
01:10:08,368 --> 01:10:10,219
The lake is so large that it's hard to find

667
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:11,125
Right?

668
01:10:52,407 --> 01:10:53,141
Sister

669
01:10:54,743 --> 01:10:55,743
Sister

670
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:04,563
I'm sorry

671
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,118
I don't know how to apologize

672
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,844
It's all my fault.

673
01:11:22,594 --> 01:11:23,125
No..

674
01:11:24,227 --> 01:11:27,524
If only you could play with me

675
01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:30,383
This never happened

676
01:11:33,133 --> 01:11:35,329
It's all your fault.

677
01:11:36,282 --> 01:11:37,969
You're wrong.

678
01:11:38,672 --> 01:11:39,680
Never mind,Eiko

679
01:11:40,391 --> 01:11:44,329
Let's pray to God instead of Kaoru

680
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,766
I don't know how people feel like dying

681
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:56,946
Her life was about to begin

682
01:11:57,633 --> 01:11:59,696
Kaoru was a little weird

683
01:12:00,180 --> 01:12:03,735
After all We like women like Asako

684
01:12:35,219 --> 01:12:35,875
Oh you

685
01:12:38,258 --> 01:12:38,719
What's wrong?

686
01:12:39,696 --> 01:12:40,758
Are you feeling sick?

687
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,625
After all it is not good to catch a cold at night

688
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:55,094
But the common cold is not part of the disease.

689
01:12:55,594 --> 01:12:57,860
Cheer up,
It's not so you

690
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:10,915
What's wrong?

691
01:13:12,336 --> 01:13:13,243
Are you worried about Kaoru-san?

692
01:13:13,930 --> 01:13:15,844
She tried to commit suicide on her own.

693
01:13:16,282 --> 01:13:17,094
So you never mind

694
01:13:17,204 --> 01:13:17,750
Go home!

695
01:13:19,383 --> 01:13:20,062
Go home!

696
01:13:20,852 --> 01:13:21,984
Go home guys!

697
01:13:29,594 --> 01:13:32,485
You don't get excited.
They came to visit her

698
01:13:33,133 --> 01:13:36,594
I don't want to see their faces either

699
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:38,024
Calm down

700
01:13:38,049 --> 01:13:40,586
You should get some rest as doctor said

701
01:13:41,477 --> 01:13:43,360
Dad...I...

702
01:13:44,118 --> 01:13:46,821
I will never be involved with them again

703
01:13:47,774 --> 01:13:49,258
What's wrong with them?

704
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:52,219
Nothing

705
01:13:53,766 --> 01:14:00,125
But When I see them, I feel like I'm looking at me

706
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:07,891
I was so stupid

707
01:14:08,555 --> 01:14:12,719
I see.
I'm sorry I didn't care of you

708
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,172
I believed in you

709
01:14:16,172 --> 01:14:19,219
I knew you'd reflect on yourself at some point.

710
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:24,008
Thank you for your reflection.
That's what I believed in you

711
01:14:24,868 --> 01:14:26,719
I'm not..Dad...

712
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:28,743
I'm not..

713
01:14:29,352 --> 01:14:30,688
Let's go

714
01:14:31,594 --> 01:14:34,641
When you're sick, your nerves can get on edge.

715
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:36,016
Never mind

716
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:44,180
Do you believe in a daughter like me?

717
01:14:44,205 --> 01:14:45,157
Why not?

718
01:14:45,610 --> 01:14:46,250
You stupid

719
01:14:47,547 --> 01:14:49,094
You know nothing

720
01:14:49,657 --> 01:14:50,657
You're a foolish parent.

721
01:14:52,610 --> 01:14:54,735
I...I....

722
01:14:55,086 --> 01:14:55,915
Asako...

723
01:14:56,165 --> 01:15:00,422
Please leave me alone

724
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,579
I'm not asking you to be sorry, just you.

725
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:07,110
I also reflect on myself in various ways

726
01:15:08,188 --> 01:15:12,703
Please talk to me anytime if anything happens

727
01:15:13,110 --> 01:15:15,461
Ok? Please rest

728
01:15:38,946 --> 01:15:40,571
Thank you for telling me

729
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,758
Repenting is more courageous than sinning

730
01:15:46,852 --> 01:15:51,657
As her father, as a religious man, I thank you.

731
01:15:52,618 --> 01:15:57,009
But You're not the only one who sent her to her death.

732
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,087
In fact

733
01:16:01,540 --> 01:16:04,235
This is her diary

734
01:16:05,259 --> 01:16:07,391
I didn't know until I read this

735
01:16:08,876 --> 01:16:15,876
She seems to have been raped by a man before

736
01:16:17,399 --> 01:16:19,899
She was very suffering

737
01:16:22,141 --> 01:16:25,860
I didn't know her suffering

738
01:16:26,298 --> 01:16:28,016
I think I'm also responsible

739
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:32,548
I feel sorry for her

740
01:16:33,759 --> 01:16:36,954
But she had a beautiful heart

741
01:16:39,032 --> 01:16:43,259
I thought I'd burn this diary as her secret

742
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:47,055
But I'll give you this,Eiko-san

743
01:16:47,829 --> 01:16:49,298
Take your time reading this.

744
01:16:50,368 --> 01:16:55,399
She tried to live beautifully while suffering

745
01:16:55,798 --> 01:16:57,649
She made a lot of effort

746
01:16:59,501 --> 01:17:00,282
Nitta-kun

747
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:06,649
She committed suicide against the heart of God

748
01:17:08,352 --> 01:17:15,540
But I'm sure God will forgive her

749
01:17:18,391 --> 01:17:23,954
You two must have the courage to live strong for Kaoru.

750
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:28,805
Then Let's pray for her

751
01:18:23,277 --> 01:18:25,488
I pray for mercy, God.

752
01:18:27,504 --> 01:18:32,886
I lost my beloved daughter

753
01:18:34,715 --> 01:18:39,488
I pray to you now

754
01:18:42,644 --> 01:18:48,332
Forgive me for all your sins.

755
01:18:48,652 --> 01:18:51,996
Please forgive her sin

756
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:55,090
Amen

757
01:20:44,175 --> 01:20:52,097
You must carefully protect your virginity until you are married.

758
01:20:53,332 --> 01:20:59,082
You can love your husband, raise your children, and love your home.

759
01:20:59,433 --> 01:21:04,050
This is the greatest happiness as a woman

760
01:21:04,824 --> 01:21:07,183
So as a woman.....

761
01:21:19,026 --> 01:21:25,167
Finish

2
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:29,841
You guys become, from this day the henchmen of the master.

3
00:00:31,054 --> 00:00:37,421
You have to listen to your master whatever he says

4
00:00:39,666 --> 00:00:42,103
Take the sake for the promise

5
00:01:17,607 --> 00:01:26,497
Now that you have accepted this cup, you will lay down your life for your master.

6
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:40,834
We'll have this

7
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,846
I'll kill your master!

8
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:12,099
This trip is a rush trip.

9
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:23,364
It's going to be hard for you, but you're going to do it because it's your way up the ladder, and you're going to do it well.

10
00:02:25,247 --> 00:02:25,685
Yes

11
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:30,107
I'm going

12
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:34,545
Please take care of your health

13
00:02:35,014 --> 00:02:35,897
Thanks

14
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,202
Have a safe trip

15
00:02:41,827 --> 00:02:43,819
I'm going

16
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,894
Here it is

17
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:10,730
Okayo

18
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:16,308
This is a good luck charm for you

19
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:25,599
Okayo

20
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:31,302
I'll be back after 3 years

21
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:35,662
Please wait for me

22
00:04:12,075 --> 00:04:12,716
Hideji

23
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:17,325
He's gone to somewhere

24
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:20,309
Don't worry. He'll be back

25
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,377
hey, time for fight

26
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,521
Please bet

27
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,248
Let's play

28
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,240
Damn it

29
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:55,322
This isn't just gambling

30
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,187
Hey guest

31
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:19,287
That's is our sign board.
If you take it, I can't see my boss anymore

32
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:26,210
Can you get it back to me?

33
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,471
It's none of my business

34
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,891
You wanna be killed too?

35
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:39,838
You are stubborn

36
00:06:46,198 --> 00:06:54,831
Odeiri (1964)

37
00:07:26,253 --> 00:07:27,808
Hey traveler

38
00:07:32,673 --> 00:07:34,264
Do you want to earn money?

39
00:07:41,265 --> 00:07:45,868
IF you help us, I will pay 1 ryo 3

40
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:52,955
Which group are you belonging to?

41
00:07:53,168 --> 00:07:55,675
I forgot, sorry

42
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,240
We are Komoro unit from Akaiyoi

43
00:08:00,093 --> 00:08:01,158
Akaiyoi?

44
00:08:01,996 --> 00:08:04,666
Our opponent is ODAIJUKU's Katsuma.
He is very stingy.

45
00:08:07,181 --> 00:08:11,123
Akaiyoi and Katsuma are brother team?
Why are they fighting?

46
00:08:12,457 --> 00:08:16,648
AKAIWA threw a drink at TOUBE for a little cause.

47
00:08:17,294 --> 00:08:19,269
a fight is not worth talking about unless you win

48
00:08:19,716 --> 00:08:22,657
So we need helpers

49
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,581
It's none of my business

50
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:28,497
Hold on

51
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,680
I know you are Hideji from Katsuma Unit

52
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:44,674
You remember?
I'm Matsukura's Hanji from Sasajima unit

53
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,278
I will beat you

54
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:56,497
Our boss will revenge you

55
00:08:58,209 --> 00:08:59,849
You don't worry about your Unit?

56
00:09:01,575 --> 00:09:07,292
In the three years I've been gone, there have been more strange people.

57
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:08,763
Shut up. Gets your hands off of me

58
00:09:09,565 --> 00:09:13,748
Don't get excited.
It's still daytime

59
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:19,973
Damn it

60
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,395
Hanji.
No need to panic.

61
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:25,307
He'll be killed soon

62
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:37,966
I will show you around

63
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,668
Hey hold on

64
00:09:48,372 --> 00:09:52,243
I'll ask you again.
The helper fee is 1 ryo 3?

65
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:52,911
Yes

66
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,491
1 ryo 3?

67
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:02,519
I'll talk to my mate

68
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:04,969
Mate?

69
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,237
He's my close mate

70
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:15,437
What do you think?

71
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,100
What do you think?

72
00:10:27,383 --> 00:10:29,506
That's what I though

73
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:32,099
He said that

74
00:10:34,997 --> 00:10:36,091
Hey

75
00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:49,973
You walk so fast

76
00:10:50,754 --> 00:10:53,780
I will ask to Katsuma unit about the helper fee

77
00:10:54,859 --> 00:10:57,587
The fee will be high if they will fight

78
00:10:58,411 --> 00:11:01,912
1 ryo 3 is too cheap for me

79
00:11:13,786 --> 00:11:15,015
Business is thriving.

80
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,393
Thank you

81
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:20,434
We can sell all in 10 days

82
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:25,150
I hear there are more people than usual this year

83
00:11:25,377 --> 00:11:27,302
Thank you for every time

84
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,806
Please take a look at them

85
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:38,061
Yuki

86
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:50,724
Are you going to see the gambling guy?
You are daughter of bitch

87
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:56,806
They are Yakuza.
I told you

88
00:11:58,404 --> 00:12:01,159
Don't talk badly about him

89
00:12:01,685 --> 00:12:05,911
You are in love with him.
So you lost yourself

90
00:12:06,955 --> 00:12:07,985
You'll be in trouble

91
00:12:08,865 --> 00:12:11,934
Mind your own business

92
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:14,110
Yuki

93
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,901
She's idiot

94
00:12:17,356 --> 00:12:18,982
Hey you

95
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:25,077
You know what,Yoshi

96
00:12:26,185 --> 00:12:28,898
To be honest, I worry about you

97
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:34,388
You are strange these days

98
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:37,655
I'm not comfortable because of him

99
00:12:39,168 --> 00:12:41,632
I will proof that he is not my brother

100
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:44,878
You can't, He is your only brother

101
00:12:46,377 --> 00:12:47,925
Stop it

102
00:12:50,361 --> 00:12:51,938
What are you doing?

103
00:12:52,144 --> 00:12:53,479
Stop it

104
00:12:54,395 --> 00:12:55,141
Stop it

105
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:05,865
Akaiwa unit will manage around Kinuichi from today

106
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,804
Did you talk to Katsuma unit?

107
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,652
I'll talk them later

108
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,642
Give me money for today

109
00:13:15,867 --> 00:13:17,351
I won't pay

110
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,913
You bastard!

111
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:27,954
Please show how strong you are

112
00:13:29,829 --> 00:13:32,940
I will beat you

113
00:13:32,975 --> 00:13:36,910
Killing people is a career.

114
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:38,558
Right?

115
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:46,547
Help me!

116
00:13:48,974 --> 00:13:49,826
Hey you guys

117
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,247
Dad

118
00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:53,470
Here's our territory

119
00:13:54,429 --> 00:13:56,147
I will beat you

120
00:13:58,824 --> 00:14:00,088
You've been picking fights with me

121
00:14:01,068 --> 00:14:02,127
Wait

122
00:14:03,604 --> 00:14:08,945
Akaiwa units are at Kinuichi to break down

123
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,139
You bastard!

124
00:14:18,382 --> 00:14:20,441
Hey stop it!

125
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:21,727
Don't fight

126
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:24,156
It's none of your business,bros

127
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,413
Cut it out!

128
00:14:27,675 --> 00:14:29,500
They are good brothers

129
00:14:30,459 --> 00:14:31,887
Get out!

130
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:34,770
Hey stop it!

131
00:14:37,504 --> 00:14:37,958
Hey stop it!

132
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,907

Bros

134

Hideji

135
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:52,589
Inawa

136
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,599

137
00:15:07,134 --> 00:15:08,234
Hold on

138
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:11,317
I will kill you guys if you fight

139
00:15:13,386 --> 00:15:17,347
Yakuza shouldn't bother ordinary citizens

140
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,002
I'm sorry to trouble you

141
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,752
I will talk to them and solve the problem

142
00:15:28,197 --> 00:15:30,260
solve the problem? How?

143
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,181
We can kill him

144
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:33,564
Don't make a noise

145
00:15:35,716 --> 00:15:37,989
Leave it to me

146
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:38,497

Bros.
How much is the helper fee?

153
00:16:06,788 --> 00:16:09,389
We don't fight.
I don't need it

154
00:16:09,694 --> 00:16:10,257

Go home

159
00:16:37,437 --> 00:16:38,351
Go home!

160
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:48,793
Hideji

161
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,719
Oh Yoshi

162
00:16:59,883 --> 00:17:01,047
Thanks in advance

163
00:17:01,828 --> 00:17:06,320
I didn't know You've become one of us.

164
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:12,423
They are not my bros

165
00:17:13,423 --> 00:17:14,884
It's up to you

166
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,861
What's wrong about it?

167
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,184
Just as you saw it.

168
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:25,919
What?

169
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,864
we met for the first time in three years.
You are so rude

170
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,567
I'm no longer Yakuza

171
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,848
i want to talk to you

172
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,286
Hold on

173
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:45,067
You can talk him later.
See our boss. He will be glad

174
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,641
I'm back now

175
00:17:56,157 --> 00:17:56,711
welcome back

176
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,235


177
00:18:07,266 --> 00:18:08,344
It's been a year

178
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:14,548
This place has changed while you were gone

179
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:20,464
why did Akaiwa cut ties with you?

180
00:18:21,636 --> 00:18:25,378
They wanted our territory for money

181
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:30,255
they don't follow the rules

182
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:34,513
The Sasajima unit collapsed while you were gone

183
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:39,997
Akaiwa gets them and now they have great force

184
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:44,779
they have been harassing us

185
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,333
They are terrible

186
00:18:50,145 --> 00:18:51,395
They are scam of Yakuza

187
00:18:53,512 --> 00:18:54,653
I had been patient

188
00:18:56,348 --> 00:18:59,348
I don't want to cause trouble for that market.

189
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:03,856
they are gathering helpers

190
00:19:04,637 --> 00:19:05,794
We can't fight

191
00:19:06,005 --> 00:19:06,481
I know

192
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,739
We can't do anything until that market is over

193
00:19:12,872 --> 00:19:17,926
i think I’ll ask someone to stop them

194
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:23,333
Can you ask for him?

195
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:35,358
By the way, Why inosuke went Meaka?

196
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,374
He wanted leave us

197
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:45,311
Forget what happened in past

198
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,683
Where are you going?

199
00:20:12,047 --> 00:20:16,937
There is nowhere you can go

200
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:26,445
Wait. You really go?

201
00:20:26,797 --> 00:20:28,609
Don't go

202
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:30,922
What are you doing?

203
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:31,898
You are annoying

204
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:37,453
You have no money.
I looked after you

205
00:20:40,521 --> 00:20:42,404
you pay off my debt to sell your body

206
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:55,802
Akaiwa are targeting at Kimuichi

207
00:20:56,771 --> 00:20:59,794
I see.
so you want our help

208
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:06,013
We are brother.
We are willing to help you

209
00:21:06,826 --> 00:21:09,677
Thank you very much.
I will tell my boss

210
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:24,118
Hen, Sanpei

211
00:21:25,453 --> 00:21:28,860
Don't look down us.
You should pay

212
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:31,477
I have no money

213
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:32,453
What's the hell?

214
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:35,945
You bastard!

215
00:21:51,989 --> 00:21:53,857
It was better to kill scam

216
00:21:54,669 --> 00:21:55,216
You

217
00:22:00,435 --> 00:22:01,388
Are you the master?

218
00:22:03,818 --> 00:22:05,857
Do you wanna hire me?

219
00:22:06,638 --> 00:22:09,818
You killed our staff.
You are too selfish

220
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,341
I see

221
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:25,451
I listened your conversation by happening.If you fight, one of you will collapse

222
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:30,544
One way of doing things can destroy both.

223
00:22:37,216 --> 00:22:39,122
This is good for you, I think

224
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:47,398
I will talk about it later

225
00:22:49,202 --> 00:22:52,992
It's ok Katsuma and Akaiwa is going to fight

226
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:43,460
Boss

227
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:49,811
I don't see the girl

228
00:23:51,251 --> 00:23:51,876
Is she alright?

229
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:57,485
I told you to forget about past

230
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:11,915
Hideji bros

231
00:25:14,728 --> 00:25:15,946
What brings you to this place?

232
00:25:17,923 --> 00:25:18,720
She's Oyuki

233
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:22,251
She's a good girl, ain't she?

234
00:25:29,915 --> 00:25:30,376
Yoshi

235
00:25:34,306 --> 00:25:35,915
Inosuke is at origin house?

236
00:25:37,212 --> 00:25:37,697
Yes

237
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:42,486
I feel sorry about him

238
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:47,158
Don't talk badly about your brother

239
00:25:51,447 --> 00:25:54,400
Sorry, I can't say

240
00:26:37,457 --> 00:26:38,613
Hi

241
00:27:19,742 --> 00:27:22,164
Give me a break,Ino

242
00:27:38,459 --> 00:27:39,061
Ino

243
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:50,150
Thank you very much

244
00:28:58,189 --> 00:28:59,736
I don't want you to catch a cold.

245
00:29:53,129 --> 00:29:56,503
I wonder What is Hideji doing now?

246
00:30:04,112 --> 00:30:05,159
Okayo

247
00:30:33,261 --> 00:30:34,386
We can't

248
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:39,550
I love you

249
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,363
We can't

250
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:42,717
We can't

251
00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:51,478
You betrayed me

252
00:30:51,993 --> 00:30:55,204
You took my girl.
You bastard!

253
00:31:00,032 --> 00:31:00,626
Ino!

254
00:31:02,892 --> 00:31:04,290
I don't care what you say.

255
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:07,150
I loved Okayo

256
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:10,868
I wanted to make her happy

257
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:15,563
What's the hell?
You think I can't make her happy?

258
00:31:16,032 --> 00:31:16,525
yeah

259
00:31:19,501 --> 00:31:23,087
You’re Yakuza,
You can't make her happy

260
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:28,518
I left from Yakuza,
Now I understand what's world

261
00:31:30,111 --> 00:31:34,635
You can't live a decent life in the yakuza world.

262
00:31:38,705 --> 00:31:43,033
Hideji, please leave Okayo to me

263
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:44,869
Please

264
00:31:51,045 --> 00:31:53,177
Please Hideji

265
00:31:55,443 --> 00:31:56,943
I can't

266
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:02,201
For three years while I was traveling, I thought only of her.

267
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:05,232
She's mine

268
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:10,029
I'll get her back to me

269
00:32:10,912 --> 00:32:13,045
I don't wanna talk with you

270
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,240
Hideji

271
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:47,763
Okayo

272
00:32:54,678 --> 00:32:59,232
You can go to Hideji if you want

273
00:33:06,932 --> 00:33:07,495
You

274
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,379
I wanna drink

275
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:25,512
i had a stupid dream

276
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:02,937
Don't be hesitate

277
00:34:15,098 --> 00:34:16,824
Drinking sake is better than her

278
00:34:29,048 --> 00:34:30,314
Hideiji is here?

279
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,571
This is going to be an interesting

280
00:34:36,198 --> 00:34:37,151
I found him

281
00:34:37,698 --> 00:34:39,909
Really? he is here?

282
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:45,352
i will pay you back

283
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:52,209
Don't fight here!

284
00:34:52,349 --> 00:34:54,803
Stop it!

285
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:01,156
stop it!

286
00:35:04,625 --> 00:35:05,695
stop it!

287
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,763
Damn it

288
00:35:24,619 --> 00:35:25,439
Damn it

289
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,973
Oh my god.
We should go home

290
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:41,801
Shit

291
00:35:42,316 --> 00:35:44,495
He's stronger than you

292
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:48,339
Who are you?

293
00:35:50,443 --> 00:35:55,005
Akaiwa get mad if you go back

294
00:35:56,781 --> 00:35:58,906
Can you help me?

295
00:35:59,437 --> 00:36:02,476
We pay you a lot

296
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:03,687
I don't want

297
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:04,859
What do you want?

298
00:36:05,937 --> 00:36:07,406
Your life

299
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:32,753
Excuse me

300
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:37,073
Sensei

301
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,831
Please get up

302
00:36:41,738 --> 00:36:47,816
Akaiwa will pay you back.
Because his henchman was killed

303
00:36:50,145 --> 00:36:53,340
We can earn 2 ryo

304
00:36:54,505 --> 00:36:56,809
or 3 ryo

305
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,528
It seems the battle is over

306
00:37:12,153 --> 00:37:14,129
There is no helper for Katsuma

307
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,934
I wanna see how he cries

308
00:37:17,959 --> 00:37:18,942
they came to attack

309
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:23,215
they came to attack

310
00:37:32,928 --> 00:37:35,928
Don't be scared.
He's alone

311
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,022
I'm not here for fighting

312
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:44,874
I have a favor to ask from you

313
00:37:45,428 --> 00:37:46,264
What?

314
00:37:47,037 --> 00:37:49,514
Please don't fight until Kimuichi is over

315
00:37:50,233 --> 00:37:51,272
Do you afraid?

316
00:37:51,632 --> 00:37:56,022
I'm not talking to you guys.
I'm talking to Akaiwa

317
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,921
You ask me to wait?

318
00:37:59,889 --> 00:38:03,460
You killed our henchmen
What's the hell?

319
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,796
They weren't killed by Katsuma unit

320
00:38:07,046 --> 00:38:10,210
How can we trust you?

321
00:38:10,632 --> 00:38:12,725
i only tell the truth

322
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:15,022
I don't trust you

323
00:38:16,678 --> 00:38:22,046
It seemed you killed our 5 henchmen

324
00:38:23,169 --> 00:38:23,903
What?

325
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,841
So you don't trust me

326
00:38:29,317 --> 00:38:29,927
No!

327
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,044
I see so it can't be helped

328
00:38:35,058 --> 00:38:37,261
i gave my little finger

329
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,683
your little finger won't solve the problem

330
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:44,034
What?

331
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:46,269
You should go home

332
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:49,519
You're stubborn

333
00:38:50,886 --> 00:38:53,488
I speak in yakuza terms

334
00:38:53,808 --> 00:38:55,581
It won't work

335
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:05,542
In this world, the stronger one wins

336
00:39:06,909 --> 00:39:09,354
Any more involvement with us, we will kill you.

337
00:39:11,229 --> 00:39:11,846
Go home

338
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:13,175
Damn it

339
00:39:16,171 --> 00:39:17,085
Don't move

340
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,156
I will kill him if you move

341
00:39:22,031 --> 00:39:24,484
You're not fair

342
00:39:24,601 --> 00:39:25,390
You too

343
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:31,296
i have my own way

344
00:39:33,023 --> 00:39:33,742
Wait

345
00:39:36,298 --> 00:39:38,594
what do you do with him?

346
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:43,501
I'll keep this man until the market is over.

347
00:39:49,147 --> 00:39:53,765
Don't go.
He might kill him

348
00:40:14,591 --> 00:40:15,599
I can't believe it

349
00:40:18,943 --> 00:40:21,638
We're unlucky

350
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,068
I got the money, but we are in this situation

351
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,291
I’m out of luck

352
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,666
Is your son a hostage?

353
00:40:36,471 --> 00:40:41,494
He is my only son

354
00:40:42,346 --> 00:40:47,314
Attacking him could get my son killed.
So please help me

355
00:40:48,658 --> 00:40:53,619
You are Akaiwa but You love your son too much.

356
00:40:54,682 --> 00:41:02,369
You care more about your child than the market

357
00:41:03,412 --> 00:41:04,709
Give me a break

358
00:41:07,482 --> 00:41:11,295
you always compliment me but...

359
00:41:14,154 --> 00:41:16,201
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

360
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:40,024
What can I do for you?

361
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:46,321
I have or I don't have, but I tell you

362
00:41:47,513 --> 00:41:53,341
Looks like you've done me right so far today.I will surely rain blood between Katsuma and Akaiwa.

363
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:00,966
Don't feel like you've won just because you took a hostage

364
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:07,333
why are you defying me?

365
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:09,989
I don't hate you

366
00:42:11,966 --> 00:42:15,325
I just wanna kill all of Yakuza

367
00:42:16,544 --> 00:42:17,646
You bastard!

368
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,726
Hold on

369
00:42:24,289 --> 00:42:25,406
What are you doing?

370
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:27,781
Get out from here

371
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:32,890
Hideji,
Can you guys leave from here?

372
00:42:34,062 --> 00:42:34,992
What's the hell?

373
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:41,195
you guys are causing a lot of trouble here

374
00:42:41,711 --> 00:42:43,843
Can you guys leave from here?

375
00:42:44,468 --> 00:42:46,008
It's none of my business

376
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:47,047
What?

377
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:50,570
Cut it out,Ina

378
00:42:51,375 --> 00:42:54,734
that sword of yours is useless

379
00:42:55,875 --> 00:43:00,140
I want to calm down the current commotion

380
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:04,812
Or you want me to leave here?

381
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:09,187
I see. that's right

382
00:43:10,242 --> 00:43:10,922
What?

383
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,843
Hideji

384
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,203
What are you doing?

385
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:20,758
Our boss is waiting for you

386
00:43:23,804 --> 00:43:27,250
I tell you.
I won't listen to you

387
00:43:29,795 --> 00:43:31,444
I won't let you do what you think

388
00:43:33,061 --> 00:43:35,905
You should show them around

389
00:43:37,030 --> 00:43:39,756
I kept you waiting

390
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:45,356
This way

391
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:51,825
I will beat you later

392
00:43:53,278 --> 00:43:55,294
Maybe something interesting will happen before that

393
00:44:48,705 --> 00:44:49,197
Okayo

394
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:57,440
You don't have to reply.
Let's go with me

395
00:45:25,751 --> 00:45:26,603
Dad

396
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:41,151
Dad

397
00:45:44,096 --> 00:45:46,893
She's not my daughter

398
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:09,488
Okayo

399
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,449
I feel sorry about you and our boss

400
00:46:19,606 --> 00:46:21,426
Please go back to our boss

401
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,960
I feel sorry about my dad

402
00:46:32,429 --> 00:46:35,968
But I don't want to go back to the gangster life again.

403
00:46:37,796 --> 00:46:38,600
Okayo

404
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:45,882
Please stop to disturb us

405
00:46:47,234 --> 00:46:50,336
I worry about you

406
00:46:52,164 --> 00:46:53,680
Don't worry

407
00:46:59,982 --> 00:47:01,544
You hate me?

408
00:47:02,739 --> 00:47:03,396
Don't get me wrong

409
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:06,075
I still love you

410
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:21,672
Mom

411
00:47:23,164 --> 00:47:26,734
What should I do

412
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:32,085
Okayo

413
00:48:27,413 --> 00:48:27,936
Who?

414
00:48:30,334 --> 00:48:31,553
Are you Okayo?

415
00:48:35,808 --> 00:48:36,488
I'd been waiting for you

416
00:48:51,285 --> 00:48:57,605
I can give your son to Katsuma

417
00:49:14,928 --> 00:49:17,209
Wait, I'll give you money

418
00:49:20,887 --> 00:49:23,208
i have as much money as you want

419
00:49:27,708 --> 00:49:28,099
Okayo

420
00:49:30,411 --> 00:49:30,841
Okayo

421
00:49:57,245 --> 00:49:57,971
Okayo?

422
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:10,279
I'm here to talk with you

423
00:50:15,584 --> 00:50:16,592
I want Okayo

424
00:50:16,943 --> 00:50:19,248
You kidnapped her

425
00:50:19,561 --> 00:50:20,311
What?

426
00:50:20,834 --> 00:50:21,904
You're not fair

427
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:23,568
Where is she now?

428
00:50:24,029 --> 00:50:24,951
I have no idea

429
00:50:26,037 --> 00:50:27,654
I'm here to talk with you

430
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:30,732
What's wrong?

431
00:50:33,162 --> 00:50:34,404
She is at Akaiwa

432
00:50:34,717 --> 00:50:35,467
What?

433
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:40,865
Akaiwa told me he needed her

434
00:50:56,914 --> 00:50:59,508
Don't go there

435
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:04,969
They are Yakiza.
They don't listen to us

436
00:51:05,531 --> 00:51:07,219
It's pointless

437
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:10,625
you got her into a yakuza fight

438
00:51:19,064 --> 00:51:21,314
She's my wife

439
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:32,699
Please accept what Akaiwa says

440
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:39,347
We'll get into the fray.
We will lose

441
00:51:40,152 --> 00:51:41,871
I know that

442
00:51:45,558 --> 00:51:49,363
She is not Yakiza.
We need to have her leave from them

443
00:51:49,965 --> 00:51:53,129
So please, boss

444
00:51:54,941 --> 00:52:01,035
I can't.
We cut a tie but She's my daughter

445
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:06,160
I can't give my territory because of her

446
00:52:07,176 --> 00:52:07,746
Boss

447
00:52:10,488 --> 00:52:12,183
Territory is the life of the Yakuza.

448
00:52:55,969 --> 00:52:56,790
No

449
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:07,525
Darling

450
00:53:15,603 --> 00:53:16,790
Help me

451
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:53,769
You guys!

452
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,584
Darling

453
00:54:50,017 --> 00:54:51,048
Darling

454
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:01,926
Sorry

455
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,668
Sensei

456
00:55:10,708 --> 00:55:11,755
Boss is calling you

457
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:34,344
Get me OKAYO back

458
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,883
you still don't understand

459
00:55:41,923 --> 00:55:47,110
If you give Taichi back to me, I will give her back.

460
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:49,313
It's nothing to do with Okayo

461
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,243
She's not Yakuza

462
00:55:53,268 --> 00:55:57,854
She's your wife but she is Tobei's daughter

463
00:55:58,119 --> 00:56:01,135
IF you listen to me, I will take an action

464
00:56:02,557 --> 00:56:04,010
I'll take her

465
00:56:17,251 --> 00:56:18,016
She's not here

466
00:56:18,313 --> 00:56:19,493
You

467
00:56:25,918 --> 00:56:26,488
Come here

468
00:56:37,856 --> 00:56:39,910
How far would you go?
Where's Okayo?

469
00:56:41,848 --> 00:56:43,653
I won't let her back to you

470
00:56:44,113 --> 00:56:44,653
What?

471
00:56:46,418 --> 00:56:51,058
You took her, so I slept with her for revenge

472
00:56:54,909 --> 00:56:59,924
I wanted to make you feel bad

473
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:02,518
Don't get me wrong

474
00:57:04,169 --> 00:57:04,747
I'm talking right

475
00:57:07,247 --> 00:57:09,255
You bastard!

476
00:58:01,424 --> 00:58:02,174
Bros

477
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:12,567
Boss

478
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:34,312
Ina..sorry

479
00:58:35,986 --> 00:58:37,127
Damn it,Akaiwa!

480
00:58:37,572 --> 00:58:38,689
Yoshitaro

481
00:58:40,666 --> 00:58:41,713
Let me go

482
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:46,596
You are stupid
You can't do anything alone

483
00:58:53,870 --> 00:58:55,502
I will fight with them

484
00:58:58,018 --> 00:58:58,541
Bros

485
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:10,966
Boss

486
00:59:14,481 --> 00:59:17,825
Reply Akaiwa.
We won't forgive him

487
00:59:23,552 --> 00:59:25,388
We have to fight with them one day

488
00:59:40,648 --> 00:59:42,796
Let's count down, and start

489
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:45,062
OK

490
00:59:48,554 --> 00:59:49,211
1

491
00:59:53,156 --> 00:59:53,531
2

492
00:59:58,084 --> 00:59:58,647
3

493
01:00:08,321 --> 01:00:09,188
Wait

494
01:00:10,664 --> 01:00:11,664
What are you doing?

495
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:15,828
Throw away your sword

496
01:00:19,763 --> 01:00:21,115
You're not fair

497
01:00:26,177 --> 01:00:29,560
Do whatever you want.
I'm not afraid to die

498
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,365
But you have to let her go

499
01:00:33,857 --> 01:00:34,654
Hideji

500
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:46,941
You are man,
just kill me

501
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:55,426
Cut me in front

502
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,610
Let her go

503
01:01:16,305 --> 01:01:17,430
She's our boss's

504
01:02:15,556 --> 01:02:18,509
Don't go for fighting

505
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:25,314
Okayo..It can't be helped

506
01:02:26,429 --> 01:02:29,476
I have an idea

507
01:02:30,562 --> 01:02:32,226
You leave from here

508
01:02:33,562 --> 01:02:34,890
I can't do that

509
01:02:36,601 --> 01:02:40,152
Why?

510
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,474
I should have traveled with you 3 years ago

511
01:02:50,419 --> 01:02:52,396
I should have been stronger

512
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:54,841
Okayo

513
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:03,685
Ina was killed

514
01:03:08,586 --> 01:03:12,008
If he had lived, he would have taken you with him and left here.

515
01:03:14,907 --> 01:03:19,258
But he was died.
You are still his wife

Katsuma and Akaiwa are asking for helpers.
They will be fighting soon

519
01:04:37,690 --> 01:04:39,331

No way, You have to work

521
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:50,776
As you may know, Yakuza fights are won when the odds are stacked against them.

522
01:04:51,292 --> 01:04:54,409
It's inconvenience or us if they finish soon

523

00:00:11,074 --> 00:00:14,410
<i>Previously in Episode 1 & 2 of <AT THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE> Series</i>

3
00:00:17,654 --> 00:00:23,123
I pronounce judgment on the divorce claim of SAWANO YOKO and SAWANO SHINSUKE.

4
00:00:24,216 --> 00:00:27,693
I would dismiss plaintiff's claims.

5
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:30,927
YOKO lost the trial.

6
00:00:33,154 --> 00:00:37,732
YOKO's six months of efforts were in vain.

7
00:00:48,635 --> 00:00:52,541
Their love began when they were students.

8
00:00:56,743 --> 00:01:00,055
Suddenly an unfortunate incident occurred.

9
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:13,926
Mitsuharu was gone

10
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,959
I married with Shinsuke Sawano

11
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:28,045
A glamorous but empty wedding

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,904
But

13
00:01:30,779 --> 00:01:33,678
Mitsuharu is alive

14
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,420
He lost his memory

15
00:01:40,074 --> 00:01:44,386
His memory is getting recovery

16
00:01:44,808 --> 00:01:45,980
And

17
00:01:47,535 --> 00:01:50,513
They got to meet again

18
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,951
Yoko!

19
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:18,678
His heart was broken.
He was asked by Nimura to go to Cambodia for work

20
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:21,493
He accepted it

21
00:02:22,204 --> 00:02:25,711
He's focusing on his work now

22
00:02:27,885 --> 00:02:33,049
YOKO was in divorce court with SHINSUKE.

23
00:02:35,026 --> 00:02:37,635
But she didn't work well

24
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:40,198
Yoko was lost

25
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:44,643
In desperation they met again.

26
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,643
Mitsuharu needed to leave for Cambodian in a few days

27
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:56,612
They walked around the part where they used to visit often

28
00:02:58,557 --> 00:02:59,159
And

29
00:03:00,268 --> 00:03:04,135
Please go to Cambodia as Nimura told you

30
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:07,624
Why?

31
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:10,045
I will continue with the trial.

32
00:03:10,842 --> 00:03:14,725
I will fight it all the way to the Supreme Court.

33
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,717
YOKO

34
00:03:17,436 --> 00:03:22,710
I got courage from you

35
00:03:24,986 --> 00:03:30,471
I will put up with not seeing you for six months.

36
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:36,424
They were feeling braver.

37
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:39,471
They exchanged their watch

38
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:43,018
For their love

39
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:47,752
They walked in the park in the morning and go home

40
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:55,080
Mitsuharu will go to Cambodia in a few days

41
00:03:55,456 --> 00:03:56,456
End of Episode 1&2 Summary

42
00:04:07,134 --> 00:04:14,134
<i>AT THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE (Episode 3)</i>

43
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:42,062
This is my first time to leave from Japan

44
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,866
I'm parting from Yoko bit by bit

45
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:52,189
How are you doing now that the trial is over?

46
00:04:53,018 --> 00:05:01,712
We are away now, but we believe in each other

47
00:05:02,955 --> 00:05:08,268
I believe in our future so I don't worry about being in Japan

48
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:13,455
I passed Hong Kong, and Indonesia

49
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:16,588
I adjust the time

50
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,119
I'll arrive in Phnom Penh

51
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,807
It's still rainy season in Cambodia

52
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:26,393
It's raining

53
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:29,338
This is Phnom Penh city

54
00:06:04,022 --> 00:06:08,702
I'll stay here for 3 months

55
00:06:09,155 --> 00:06:12,382
The hotel where I say is in the middle of City

56
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:45,117
This is my first time I spend the night in Cambodia

57
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:52,523
I still feel like being in Tokyo

58
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:58,669
I'm getting lonely to be alone

59
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,708
It's getting night here.
I guess Tokyo is mid-night

60
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,844
The Southern Cross is very visible here.

61
00:09:00,912 --> 00:09:03,232
Japan embassy

62
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:07,154
Here close at 1 pm.
Shall we go out?

63
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:10,957
This is Angkor Wat.

64
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:12,699
This is so great

65
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:16,981
I've wanted to see Angkor Wat.

66
00:09:17,332 --> 00:09:19,192
Oh you are architect

67
00:09:21,342 --> 00:09:25,772
It's easy to go there.
There are plane for there 4 times a week. and it takes 7 hours if you get a bus

68
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:27,420
I definitely go

69
00:09:48,842 --> 00:09:50,826
What's wrong,Bros?

70
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:54,256
I'm on the work

71
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:56,951
Ask me when I finish my work

72
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,318
I might be fired

73
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:01,701
Eh?

74
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:04,037
They'll fire me

75
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:07,615
Tell me why?

76
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,787
Because of you

77
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,427
I'm your brother

78
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,474
That's so mean that they fire you

79
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:19,810
Sawano is department chief but

80
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:26,044
They will fire me for some reason or another.

81
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:31,333
To be honest. all is your fault.
It's because of your divorce decree.

82
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:36,529
Please Yoko

83
00:10:38,044 --> 00:10:43,193
Please think about our feelings as my family will be confused.

84
00:10:46,414 --> 00:10:49,875
You don't have to be stubborn.

85
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:53,406
I'm not stubborn.

86
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:57,006
you don't listen to my wishes

87
00:10:57,553 --> 00:10:59,155
Bros

88
00:11:01,123 --> 00:11:04,444
Do you still love Sugano?
You are an idiot

89
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:07,827
I've got 3 days off

90
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:10,819
I decided to go to angkor wat

91
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,717
It takes about 7 hours by long-distance bus

92
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:17,772
This is very simple long trip

93
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:21,913
I was thinking about Angkor Wat

94
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:38,279
Angkor Wat is one of the seven wonders of the world

95
00:11:40,086 --> 00:11:45,063
I learned about it when I was in elementary school and saw the picture when I was in junior high school.

96
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:52,279
I aspired to be an architect when I saw these ruins.

97
00:11:54,012 --> 00:11:56,191
I'm here now

98
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,935
this is beautiful,right?

99
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:42,188
Are you Japanese?

100
00:12:42,993 --> 00:12:44,009
Yes I am

101
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,970
It's good to see from here

102
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,380
I always watch the sunset from here

103
00:13:09,982 --> 00:13:13,294
Angkor Wat sunset is the most beautiful in the world

104
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:17,771
My first day here was so dreamy

105
00:13:19,188 --> 00:13:22,352
I wanted to share this excitement with Yoko.

106
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:24,899
I really wanted it

107
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:28,962
My brother called me again

108
00:13:29,907 --> 00:13:34,743
I was worried about my brother's company, so I went to see him.

109
00:13:37,843 --> 00:13:40,859
He is Mr. Kadokura who is a journalist

110
00:13:41,585 --> 00:13:43,999
Nice to meet you.
I'm Kadokura

111
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:50,984
Let’s get down to the work, OK?
When did Director SAWANO buy a new car?

112
00:13:51,549 --> 00:13:55,182
I think he bought it late last year

113
00:13:55,878 --> 00:13:56,870
Why you ask me about it?

114
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,111
The story matches

115
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:07,314
Director SAWANO received a huge bribe from Kawabata-gumi for this construction

116
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,320
he is trying to fire me to escape his responsibility

117
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:12,414
Really?

118
00:14:13,031 --> 00:14:16,922
After Mr. Kadakura investigated it, I understood clearly.

119
00:14:18,711 --> 00:14:20,774
He was about to be in trouble

120
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:24,289
what are you going to do?

121
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:30,274
With his help, we publish in industry magazines

122
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,688
This'll be only way I survive

123
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,727
are you okay with that?

124
00:14:33,891 --> 00:14:36,360
I have no choice but to do it

125
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:40,951
If Director SAWANO is demoted, he will be promoted.

126
00:14:42,467 --> 00:14:45,670
will you help me?

127
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:47,388
But

128
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:50,865
Please help me to solidify the evidence

129
00:14:53,756 --> 00:14:56,349
I understand your position

130
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:01,084
We journalists cannot tolerate such injustice.

131
00:15:03,627 --> 00:15:08,393
Let's have a drink together.
I'm happy to have a drink with a beautiful woman

132
00:15:37,918 --> 00:15:46,050
The ruins have been sleeping in this forest for a thousand years.

133
00:15:47,605 --> 00:15:53,910
As an architect, I was very interested in these ruins.

134
00:15:55,595 --> 00:16:02,744
I wanted to make something related to Angkor Wat in my next work.

135
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:28,576
thank you for guiding me today

136
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:33,991
I forgot to introduce about me.
I'm Mitsuharu SUgano

137
00:16:34,342 --> 00:16:36,811
I'm Erina Shiozawa

138
00:16:36,999 --> 00:16:37,975
Shiozawa?

139
00:16:39,436 --> 00:16:41,444
It's like Japanese name

140
00:16:41,663 --> 00:16:43,514
My father is Japanese

141
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:50,511
Three days stay was too short

142
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:58,924
Some people wants to stay here forever

143
00:17:04,738 --> 00:17:08,019
I returned to Phnom Penh by evening bus

144
00:17:08,738 --> 00:17:13,159
She will also fly to Phnom Penh tomorrow.

145
00:17:13,858 --> 00:17:16,366
See you again

146
00:17:16,811 --> 00:17:18,178
See you

147
00:17:22,772 --> 00:17:24,366
See you in Phnom Penh

148
00:17:36,186 --> 00:17:37,921
Are you the president of Toyo Light Metal?

149
00:17:38,382 --> 00:17:38,796
Yes

150
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,202
I'm Kadokura who called you

151
00:17:47,788 --> 00:17:49,663
have you published this yet?

152
00:17:50,257 --> 00:17:53,546
Not yet.
We will officially print it tomorrow

153
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,421
You did a lot of research and wrote the article

154
00:17:57,446 --> 00:17:58,421
Thanks

155
00:18:00,343 --> 00:18:00,929
What can I do for you?

156
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,562
Would you mind if I published this article?

157
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,289
I'm not happy

158
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:14,215
I heard that SAWANO's father is a major shareholder of Toyo Light Metal

159
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,223
I think he will be surprised if he reads this article

160
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,207
What do you want?

161
00:18:20,676 --> 00:18:28,223
This is all I need to trash this article.

162
00:18:30,996 --> 00:18:31,738
OK

163
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:36,324
But I have one condition for you.

164
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:37,215
What?

165
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,691
Who told this?

166
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,082
No one

167
00:18:42,293 --> 00:18:46,320
I think it's someone in the company

168
00:18:51,328 --> 00:18:58,054
Director Sawano will be removed from the department head's seat and asked to go on a business trip to Europe for a while.

169
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:03,254
Mr. Yamada, the sales manager, will take over his job.

170
00:19:03,629 --> 00:19:04,605
Yamada

171
00:19:05,488 --> 00:19:06,980
I'll tell you your disposition later

172
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:10,121
what is my disposal?

173
00:19:11,301 --> 00:19:13,105
Do you want to know?

174
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:18,707
You shared company secrets with an outsider.

175
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:27,472
Actually, you guys were going to be fired from the company.

176
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,300
You know?

177
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:35,025
Kenchikukai Tenbousha Magazine

178
00:19:35,596 --> 00:19:36,853
Oh Nimura

179
00:19:37,346 --> 00:19:39,088
I stopped publishing that article.

180
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,791
There was still a lack of proof.

181
00:19:42,486 --> 00:19:45,752
I didn't know you are such a person

182
00:19:46,401 --> 00:19:48,752
That's the gangster way

183
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:53,494
gangster?
Yeah, people say that behind me

184
00:19:54,346 --> 00:19:58,869
First of all, it's your responsibility

185
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:01,073
You should give up

186
00:20:09,743 --> 00:20:11,579
Toki is also leaving

187
00:20:13,649 --> 00:20:18,251
I want to go back soon, but my mother is sick.

188
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,196
She's old so it may takes long

189
00:20:21,259 --> 00:20:22,868
It can't be helped

190
00:20:23,902 --> 00:20:25,520
I miss you

191
00:20:28,113 --> 00:20:29,691
I wanna ask you a favor

192
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:31,629
About CHikako

193
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,215
I'll look after her

194
00:20:36,655 --> 00:20:38,819
I am also responsible

195
00:20:40,717 --> 00:20:45,912
I feel sorry for her because she spends her time in many houses.

196
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,798
I hope her grandfather can be found

197
00:20:51,283 --> 00:20:52,705
Watch out!

198
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,666
We're sorry

199
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:57,166
Are you OK?

200
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,830
Oh

201
00:21:01,056 --> 00:21:02,282
Your kid?

202
00:21:03,071 --> 00:21:04,032
Yeah

203
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:07,876
Where's your mom?

204
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:12,790
She died of illness three years ago

205
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:14,946
I see

206
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:22,424
did you hear about your brother?

207
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,815
I tried any way, but It does not work well

208
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:30,627
at least he wasn't fired

209
00:21:30,885 --> 00:21:34,619
I heard that you took very good care of my brother.

210
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:37,198
See you

211
00:21:43,065 --> 00:21:43,721
Who is he?

212
00:21:44,643 --> 00:21:46,011
A strange man

213
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:01,889
Do you get letters from Mitsuharu?

214
00:22:01,914 --> 00:22:03,076
Yes sometime

215
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,451
What did he say?

216
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:06,162
I won't tell

217
00:22:07,334 --> 00:22:11,420
Sorry to ask you about it

218
00:22:32,957 --> 00:22:36,645
I will travel on a business trip next month

219
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,457
i want you to accompany me

220
00:22:40,191 --> 00:22:40,645
Yes

221
00:22:41,238 --> 00:22:46,879
Mr. Hori always accompanies me.
He's not feeling well.

222
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,091
I'm going abroad, so I want to go with a beautiful woman.

223
00:22:50,224 --> 00:22:50,833
abroad?

224
00:22:51,701 --> 00:22:53,732
i forgot to say that first

225
00:22:54,925 --> 00:22:55,855
To Southeast Asia

226
00:22:56,941 --> 00:22:57,699
Bangkok

227
00:22:58,293 --> 00:22:59,230
Do you know there?

228
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:01,371
Thailand

229
00:23:02,285 --> 00:23:05,933
There's a big Nissan dealer there called k2 motors.

230
00:23:06,777 --> 00:23:08,254
Please ask the Foreign Affairs Division for details.

231
00:23:09,566 --> 00:23:13,441
Please reply as soon as possible because there is a relationship between passport and visa.

232
00:23:15,793 --> 00:23:16,801
Chikako!

233
00:23:18,706 --> 00:23:20,183
I have a news

234
00:23:23,058 --> 00:23:24,581
Welcome home

235
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,136
Excuse me the other day

236
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,535
i have something to report to you

237
00:23:33,097 --> 00:23:34,066
What's that?

238
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:38,527
About your brother.
he is not fired

239
00:23:38,847 --> 00:23:41,246
He will be transferred to Kyushu

240
00:23:42,509 --> 00:23:45,595
Thanks for telling me

241
00:23:46,891 --> 00:23:51,712
i think you misunderstand me something

242
00:23:54,280 --> 00:24:00,585
i stopped him from getting fired

243
00:24:02,648 --> 00:24:06,905
he misunderstands me and says it's my fault

244
00:24:08,132 --> 00:24:11,648
Sorry to bother you

245
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:18,269
I like women's room

246
00:24:19,089 --> 00:24:20,832
I'm jealous of you

247
00:24:22,984 --> 00:24:28,539
I'm curious as to who designed those blueprints.

248
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,328
My friend designed it

249
00:24:33,273 --> 00:24:36,305
he is very creative

250
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:38,172
Are you curious?

251
00:24:39,094 --> 00:24:40,320
I'm curious

252
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:42,727
Her lover

253
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:45,811
Chikako

254
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:48,678
You got a  lover

255
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:51,014
No way

256
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,395
I'm starving

257
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,247
I'm leaving

258
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,503
He seems to be great

259
00:25:10,891 --> 00:25:15,844
i wanted to be an architect

260
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:21,008
See you again

261
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:25,180
sorry i didn't do anything to you

262
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:33,188
I think he is a rude person who suddenly enters the room

263
00:25:35,258 --> 00:25:38,266
i want to know your news

264
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:43,680
I might be able to meet Mitsuharu-san

265
00:25:45,446 --> 00:25:47,422
do you go to Cambodia?

266
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:48,688
I’ll go to Thailand

267
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:49,414
Thailand

268
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:51,383
Next to the Cambodia

269
00:25:52,704 --> 00:25:55,914
That's so nice!

270
00:25:57,071 --> 00:25:59,602
I'm envy you

271
00:26:29,928 --> 00:26:31,467
You're fever is gone.

272
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:32,678
Yes

273
00:26:33,646 --> 00:26:34,646
I feel relieved

274
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:41,537
You have been a great help to me.

275
00:26:45,503 --> 00:26:49,144
i feel sorry for you to be here

276
00:26:49,253 --> 00:26:52,620
I just wanna to be here

277
00:26:52,645 --> 00:26:53,831
But...

278
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:56,798
your father is worried about you

279
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:00,478
do you feel bad for him?

280
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:08,021
I will fly home tomorrow

281
00:27:08,834 --> 00:27:09,638
I see

282
00:27:14,115 --> 00:27:15,005
See you

283
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:27,915
I wanted to have a meal with the whole family before he went abroad.

284
00:27:29,253 --> 00:27:31,284
you like formalities

285
00:27:31,863 --> 00:27:33,183
You have a bad mouth afterwards

286
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,823
I thought this would be a good time to discuss

287
00:27:40,197 --> 00:27:41,626
Don't you think so?

288
00:27:43,634 --> 00:27:44,736
It's waste time

289
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,228
I think Yoko needs it

290
00:27:51,789 --> 00:27:57,648
i know how you feel but...

291
00:27:57,966 --> 00:27:58,567
I see

292
00:27:59,497 --> 00:28:03,380
You're not home all the time, so you don't know how they feel.

293
00:28:07,866 --> 00:28:08,843
Bangkok?

294
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:09,875
Yes

295
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:11,906
Did you make up your mind?

296
00:28:12,711 --> 00:28:13,344
Yes

297
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:16,734
Our family is in a lot of trouble right now.

298
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:19,023
But this is my work

299
00:28:19,281 --> 00:28:22,016
You're kidding me.
I know you wanna meet with Sugano in Cambodia by the way

300
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:23,365
You...

301
00:28:25,123 --> 00:28:28,568
You mean I can't go?

302
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:32,120
Don't worry about me

303
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:41,081
Your husband will be relegated to Kyushu and you will go abroad, so that's a good thing.

304
00:28:42,517 --> 00:28:43,485
I see

305
00:28:45,806 --> 00:28:47,313
I'm sorry

306
00:28:48,306 --> 00:28:50,946
What the hell!

307
00:28:57,589 --> 00:28:59,183
What's wrong?

308
00:29:00,402 --> 00:29:01,519
Nothing

309
00:29:02,808 --> 00:29:04,355
are you crying because you are happy?

310
00:29:05,574 --> 00:29:06,941
It might be so

311
00:29:08,629 --> 00:29:11,925
are you okay alone?

312
00:29:12,105 --> 00:29:14,410
Don't worry.
I can do anything

313
00:29:15,683 --> 00:29:18,980
i will come back as soon as possible

314
00:29:19,005 --> 00:29:23,269
please take your time sightseeing

315
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,485
Thank you

316
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,572
today is my departure day

317
00:29:45,548 --> 00:29:50,673
I will fly in the southern sky in the same plane you boarded

318
00:29:54,074 --> 00:29:58,824
This plane passes Phnom Penh and goes directly to Bangkok

319
00:29:59,683 --> 00:30:03,738
I will pass over Phnom Penh where you are

320
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:08,043
But from Bangkok to Phnom Penh it takes only 1 hour by plane.

321
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,805
There are flights every day

322
00:30:11,719 --> 00:30:15,813
i want to see you somehow

323
00:30:16,672 --> 00:30:20,899
It's my dream to make it happen on this trip

324
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,063
Excuse me but Are you Ms.Makimura?

325
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:47,649
Yes

326
00:30:47,674 --> 00:30:51,157
I'm sorry for being late.
I'm from K2 motors

327
00:30:52,094 --> 00:30:53,781
I heard that the president will pick me up

328
00:30:54,492 --> 00:30:58,383
He had an urgent business, so I came instead.

329
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,453
I see.
She is the secretary SAWANO

330
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,063
Pleased to meet you

331
00:31:03,524 --> 00:31:08,336
I heard you're staying at our house tonight.

332
00:31:08,817 --> 00:31:09,981
Your house?

333
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,981
I forgot to introduce myself.
My name is Erina Shiozawa

334
00:31:15,239 --> 00:31:16,504
are you the president's daughter?

335
00:31:16,692 --> 00:31:18,192
He's my father

336
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,085
sorry he's late

337
00:31:40,358 --> 00:31:41,460
He always back home late?

338
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:47,704
I have no chance to eat with him,but tonight...

339
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:50,931
Oh he's back

340
00:31:54,541 --> 00:31:56,283
You're so late

341
00:31:56,931 --> 00:31:58,322
I'm sorry

342
00:32:00,728 --> 00:32:01,931
You're bad

343
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:08,541
Thank you for coming

344
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,392
It's been a age

345
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:13,322
Have a seat

346
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:18,283
did you know her?

347
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:20,697
How did you know her?

348
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:24,010
It's been 20 years since I met her

349
00:32:24,393 --> 00:32:25,744
It's been 25 years

350
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:29,804
enjoy your meal everyone

351
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,460
my father was a little strange.
he is usually very arrogant

352
00:32:37,065 --> 00:32:40,885
i think their relationship is strange

353
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,440
It might be so

354
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,393
Because she is very beautiful

355
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:50,862
is she married?

356
00:32:52,051 --> 00:32:54,707
She's still single

357
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:02,817
I have thought about going back to Japan with my daughter and remarrying.

358
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,763
But I end up staying here

359
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:08,432
I can't go back now

360
00:33:10,307 --> 00:33:15,627
I never imagined that I would meet you again, who became a manager.

361
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:20,951
This deal is in your favor.

362
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:24,240
i want to make amends to you

363
00:33:25,443 --> 00:33:26,466
Shiozawa

364
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,154
I decline it

365
00:33:31,162 --> 00:33:37,380
I didn't come here with that intention.

366
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,528
I get it

367
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:45,325
Angkor Wat, next to Tasom is Krumpur

368
00:33:47,052 --> 00:33:48,919
You can get there soon by plane from Bangkok

369
00:33:50,825 --> 00:33:51,989
Do you often go there?

370
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:52,700
Yes

371
00:33:54,224 --> 00:33:57,209
These are photos that I got there last time

372
00:33:59,378 --> 00:34:01,838
This is so good

373
00:34:03,143 --> 00:34:04,503
Who takes this photo?

374
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:06,237
Well

375
00:34:06,854 --> 00:34:07,948
Your friend?

376
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,838
You don't wanna show me?

377
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:12,104
I can't

378
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:16,557
Go to there if you wanna see Anchor

379
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,057
But I'm here for work

380
00:34:19,346 --> 00:34:24,299
Your work finish tomorrow, I'm happy to guide you then

381
00:34:24,594 --> 00:34:26,883
Thanks, but

382
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,228
Your bed gets ready

383
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:35,486
Thanks

384
00:34:38,126 --> 00:34:39,017
Thanks

385
00:34:39,173 --> 00:34:41,533
Let's go there together

386
00:34:41,673 --> 00:34:42,361
Yes

387
00:34:42,603 --> 00:34:45,486
I'm sure they'll permit you to go

388
00:34:45,556 --> 00:34:47,533
Good night

389
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:16,613
The president show me around Bangkok

390
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:21,831
But I only think about going to Anchor

391
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,462
This way

392
00:35:32,025 --> 00:35:37,650
We can stay for 24 hours in Cambodia  even if you don't have the VISA

393
00:35:38,252 --> 00:35:42,345
I really wanna go there

394
00:35:46,076 --> 00:35:50,529
I think of nothing but going to Cambodia

395
00:35:51,857 --> 00:35:57,123
I wonder Elina talked him about that

396
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:05,096
I heard Sawano wanna go to Anchor

397
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:06,854
Ah..yes

398
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:08,338
Did you talk about that?

399
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,885
Yes with Elina

400
00:36:11,885 --> 00:36:15,221
She only wants to go there because of you.

401
00:36:15,995 --> 00:36:18,588
I'm afraid, I'm on the work

402
00:36:18,901 --> 00:36:22,190
It's ok, 1,2 days

403
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:28,635
It's ok. You asked me about Phnom phen.
Do you have a friend there?

404
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:31,375
Yes Kind of

405
00:36:31,703 --> 00:36:32,414
Who?

406
00:36:32,586 --> 00:36:33,695
Just friend

407
00:36:34,023 --> 00:36:36,601
He or She?
What does he/she do there?

408
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:42,867
That's weird question.
Her face shows that the friend is young man

409
00:36:43,336 --> 00:36:45,359
Oh really?

410
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:50,515
Do you wanna see him?

411
00:36:51,663 --> 00:36:54,897
Don't get me wrong, but I actually

412
00:36:57,304 --> 00:36:59,796
Don't bully her

413
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,983
What does he do there?

414
00:37:04,179 --> 00:37:06,897
He's there for Architectural Design

415
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:09,460
Ok Please go

416
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:17,432
We have time for boarding

417
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:18,737
Thank you

418
00:37:19,424 --> 00:37:22,495
You help me a lot

419
00:37:22,893 --> 00:37:25,487
I just happened to think of going there

420
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:28,862
But We can only stay there for 24 hours

421
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:31,768
It can't be helped

422
00:37:32,627 --> 00:37:34,393
Where is he staying?

423
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:38,987
He stays at Hotel Phnom phen

424
00:37:39,596 --> 00:37:41,252
Hotel Phnom phen?

425
00:37:41,917 --> 00:37:42,635
Do you know?

426
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:50,112
Yes I know.
What does he do there?

427
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:53,111
He's there for Architectural Design

428
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:13,209
Is this fine?

429
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:14,342
Yes

430
00:38:15,623 --> 00:38:16,982
You made mistake

431
00:38:17,474 --> 00:38:20,248
Check Ms.Sawano

432
00:38:21,506 --> 00:38:22,607
Mrs. is Ok

433
00:38:23,693 --> 00:38:24,529
Why?

434
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:27,240
I have some reasons

435
00:38:52,502 --> 00:38:55,892
Can you tell me what his name is?

436
00:38:56,236 --> 00:38:59,173
He's Sugano

437
00:39:00,557 --> 00:39:01,322
I see

438
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:05,611
Where's Mr.Sugano

439
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:09,119
He's gone for Anchor

440
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:11,096
He's gone for Anchor?

441
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:15,682
He told us to stay there for a few days

442
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,213
If We fly tomorrow morning to Encore, it's 10:00.

443
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,322
Our flight for Bangkok is 14:00

444
00:39:23,347 --> 00:39:24,830
We have 4 hours

445
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:29,307
You can see Mitsuharu if we have 4 hours

446
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:32,880
What's wrong?

447
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:36,716
You just said Mitsuharu

448
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,442
I told you he was Sugano

449
00:39:42,801 --> 00:39:44,255
but not Mitsuharu

450
00:39:47,915 --> 00:39:49,845
Our hotel is there

451
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:59,417
Why you didn't tell me about him?

452
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:08,409
It's natural that you and he got meet

453
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:17,613
But you should tell me about him earlier

454
00:40:17,972 --> 00:40:21,831
I feel sorry that you hide me about him

455
00:40:23,042 --> 00:40:26,659
He told me you were just friend

456
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:27,737
So?

457
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:30,722
I've been just wondering

458
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,073
But it's wrong

459
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:39,538
He's your lover,right?

460
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:48,655
Oh, Elina's lover is Sawano's...

461
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,491
His name is Sugano

462
00:40:51,827 --> 00:40:56,695
There are few Japanese Architects there

463
00:40:57,452 --> 00:41:00,374
Why you didn't stop them to go there?

464
00:41:00,656 --> 00:41:02,632
It can't be helped

465
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:06,124
I thought that made them solve something

466
00:41:08,335 --> 00:41:11,359
One of them break hearts later

467
00:41:12,281 --> 00:41:13,374
You're so mean

468
00:41:13,991 --> 00:41:16,210
Elina really wanna get married with him

469
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:18,062
I can't stop

470
00:41:20,101 --> 00:41:22,624
It can't be helped if she got broken hearts

471
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:27,054
I didn't want to give her a hard time.

472
00:41:28,327 --> 00:41:34,656
If she gets marry him, I'll be willing to give him my all assets

473
00:41:35,286 --> 00:41:40,661
You mean Sugano is more happy if he marry her

474
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:42,606
You are ironic

475
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:45,872
I'll leave it to your imagination

476
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:58,575
You are so mean.
I felt sorry that I made your heart hurt

477
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:04,506
But I have nothing to do with my wife's assets

478
00:42:05,061 --> 00:42:07,772
Forget about that

479
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,600
I'm guessing Anchor wat is the problem

480
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:15,991
What do you mean?

481
00:42:16,334 --> 00:42:22,108
My wife and I went there together.
It made us change our life

482
00:42:23,537 --> 00:42:30,225
Anchor wat has something power.
Then We got married

483
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,420
You are very literary.

484
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:38,326
I was going too far

485
00:42:40,037 --> 00:42:43,826
Once you go there, you'll know

486
00:42:45,265 --> 00:42:49,906
So there's a woman's curse on Encore.

487
00:43:43,161 --> 00:43:46,372
He's not here.
Let's go to Paya

488
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:33,965
You should be in hurry

489
00:44:37,285 --> 00:44:40,762
I wanted to come here alone

490
00:44:43,867 --> 00:44:45,821
I really feel bad

491
00:44:46,492 --> 00:44:49,367
You love him, right?

492
00:44:50,461 --> 00:44:56,461
You keep silent.
I don't have to worry about you?

493
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:57,883
Don't worry

494
00:44:59,313 --> 00:45:02,274
But I love him too

495
00:45:06,926 --> 00:45:07,903
This is what I really feel

496
00:45:11,161 --> 00:45:14,567
How can you say that?

497
00:45:15,557 --> 00:45:23,221
Sorry but you are not single,right?

498
00:45:27,563 --> 00:45:28,235
Hello?

499
00:45:36,337 --> 00:45:38,533
He's there

500
00:45:39,353 --> 00:45:41,142
Come on

501
00:46:31,216 --> 00:46:32,262
What's wrong?

502
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:37,505
Yoko

503
00:46:39,107 --> 00:46:41,107
What's wrong?

504
00:47:02,384 --> 00:47:04,455
I shouldn't have come here

505
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:06,087
What?

506
00:47:06,845 --> 00:47:09,025
What do you worry about?

507
00:47:09,447 --> 00:47:11,041
I'm not blaming you

508
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,816
It's not your fault

509
00:47:15,035 --> 00:47:16,886
You have nothing to regret.

510
00:47:19,511 --> 00:47:23,949
I've had this kind of experiences before

511
00:47:24,722 --> 00:47:26,558
But not now,Yoko

512
00:47:29,605 --> 00:47:30,269
Yoko

513
00:47:31,691 --> 00:47:34,402
It's time to go

514
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:35,800
Hold on

515
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:38,980
You don't have to leave today

516
00:47:39,605 --> 00:47:43,386
But Visa is available for 24 hours

517
00:47:44,214 --> 00:47:46,495
Yoko will be unable to go back in Japan

518
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,534
It will work out

519
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:50,855
I have to go

520
00:48:31,096 --> 00:48:34,292
You may get upset if I tell this

521
00:48:34,939 --> 00:48:40,220
I don't think you and Sugano get along well

522
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:44,947
Sorry but I'm too honest

523
00:48:47,025 --> 00:48:50,713
I never think about that

524
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:52,338
You don't know anything about us

525
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:57,150
I don't know well about you but

526
00:48:58,618 --> 00:49:04,493
My predictions are usually right.

527
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:08,803
Don't tell this to anyone

528
00:49:10,139 --> 00:49:13,928
Shiozawa and I were lover before

529
00:49:15,772 --> 00:49:23,209
We were student and he went to teach a french man as a tutor

530
00:49:25,089 --> 00:49:30,331
His daughter was very pretty..then something happened

531
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,198
I got shocked and tried to commit suicide

532
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:49,428
I ended up to think like this.
He was rich man. If he got married with his daughter, he was going to be happy

533
00:49:50,553 --> 00:49:56,006
I could get married with him if I force to get him back

534
00:49:56,725 --> 00:50:05,866
But I think he would have regretted marrying me.

535
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:14,852
I never had that confidence.

536
00:50:15,634 --> 00:50:19,602
So now I understand what we decided

537
00:50:21,306 --> 00:50:25,454
Men are untreatable

538
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,657
I don't trust men

539
00:50:29,728 --> 00:50:30,782
What do you think?

540
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:36,431
I never think in the way of your thinking

541
00:51:19,405 --> 00:51:20,803
That is Waterloo

542
00:51:33,186 --> 00:51:35,186
Are you sure to go back yesterday?

543
00:51:35,499 --> 00:51:38,835
Yes We have finished my work

544
00:51:38,989 --> 00:51:44,958
But I want you to stay here little longer

545
00:51:46,271 --> 00:51:47,560
I'm sorry

546
00:52:04,267 --> 00:52:07,470
2 months later

547
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:11,791
Yoko

548
00:52:12,721 --> 00:52:15,511
Aya!
Where did you get back?

549
00:52:15,823 --> 00:52:16,557
Yesterday

550
00:52:16,682 --> 00:52:18,026
with Fujikawa

551
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:19,783
He's still in Hokkaido

552
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,331
Oh why?

553
00:52:22,003 --> 00:52:23,706
why did you come home alone?

554
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:26,729
i decided to get married

555
00:52:27,729 --> 00:52:28,846
I came back to prepare for that

556
00:52:28,877 --> 00:52:32,619
You were already married in Hokkaido, weren't you?

557
00:52:32,666 --> 00:52:34,565
that's a secret

558
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:37,064
Only you guys know, so please keep it a secret

559
00:52:37,089 --> 00:52:39,229
You're so cheeky

560
00:52:43,526 --> 00:52:45,002
You’ll be busy

561
00:52:45,354 --> 00:52:49,924
I have to find an apartment, find a wedding venue, and decide on a wedding date.

562
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:52,261
i have to buy furniture

563
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:54,652
do you have that much money?

564
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:58,355
If I have money, I will spend it

565
00:53:00,956 --> 00:53:03,409
Look at this,Yoko

566
00:53:06,237 --> 00:53:12,690
The building that Mr. Sugano is building over there is very popular.

567
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,503
Fujikawa-san is very impressed

568
00:53:16,370 --> 00:53:20,378
What's wrong?
Did you see him there?

569
00:53:25,412 --> 00:53:26,232
What's wrong?

570
00:53:26,904 --> 00:53:29,193
I'm ok

571
00:53:29,419 --> 00:53:30,716
do you get letters from him?

572
00:53:30,927 --> 00:53:32,419
Yes sometimes

573
00:53:33,121 --> 00:53:37,066
I haven't seen him in a long time, so I won't have anything to write about.

574
00:54:32,517 --> 00:54:34,087
Sorry to have kept you waiting

575
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:35,892
Thank you

576
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:45,829
talk to me for a minute.
Don't run away

577
00:54:47,173 --> 00:54:51,517
I told you.
I have nothing to do with you

578
00:54:52,111 --> 00:54:54,830
Please stop waiting for me on the street

579
00:54:55,259 --> 00:54:57,572
Why?
I wanted to see you

580
00:54:57,619 --> 00:55:00,345
Please stop it.
I worry people’s eye too

581
00:55:04,226 --> 00:55:05,367
Don't get me wrong

582
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:10,398
you think I’m a bad person.
But I'm not

583
00:55:11,961 --> 00:55:17,125
I am very serious when I meet you

584
00:55:18,305 --> 00:55:19,242
I know

585
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:22,961
I know it's lonely at Christmas alone

586
00:55:23,078 --> 00:55:24,976
Please go home

587
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:27,351
Your kid is waiting for you

588
00:55:28,765 --> 00:55:30,031
Excuse me

589
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,436
Will you go back to Hokkaido for New Year's?

590
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,858
I wanna stay here

591
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:44,803
I'm going to be glad if you'll stay here

592
00:55:45,686 --> 00:55:47,842
I don't wanna be alone

593
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:51,077
next year you won't be alone

594
00:55:51,561 --> 00:55:52,295
Why?

595
00:55:53,592 --> 00:55:56,663
You and Mitsuharusan will spend the next year together.

596
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:04,342
Maybe next year I'll be alone with you

597
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,670
So we should be good friend

598
00:56:10,959 --> 00:56:13,991
Why?
That's weird

599
00:56:14,397 --> 00:56:17,827
He's supposed to live here

600
00:56:18,241 --> 00:56:24,498
I plan to leave here.
I'm thinking of entering a high school with a dormitory next year.

601
00:56:25,717 --> 00:56:29,310
You're strange these days

602
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:32,022
Thank you for caring me

603
00:56:44,948 --> 00:56:50,940
Let's congratulate Fujikawa-san.
Cheers

604
00:56:51,643 --> 00:56:53,120
Congratulations

605
00:56:55,229 --> 00:56:57,409
Congratulations

606
00:56:57,651 --> 00:57:00,752
today is a sad day for me

607
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:04,362
You should be honest

608
00:57:04,604 --> 00:57:05,440
Congratulations

609
00:57:05,658 --> 00:57:11,424
Enjoy your meal tonight

610
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,025
What can I do for you?

611
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,728
Mitsuharu Sugano is your student

612
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:18,861
He works at our office

613
00:57:18,947 --> 00:57:20,900
This design document was written by Mr. Sugano.

614
00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:23,893
This is what we are building in Cambodia

615
00:57:24,213 --> 00:57:26,971
You know the latest Building, don't you?

616
00:57:27,268 --> 00:57:28,783
Oh, that's an American architect.

617
00:57:29,111 --> 00:57:31,838
I haven't seen the latest issue yet

618
00:57:31,978 --> 00:57:36,361
I think this design is the same as the American building.

619
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:38,530
What do you think?

620
00:57:40,264 --> 00:57:40,600
Yeah

621
00:57:40,741 --> 00:57:44,350
i don't think this is a coincidence

622
00:57:44,616 --> 00:57:46,881
What do you wanna say?

623
00:57:47,147 --> 00:57:50,764
I think he stole the design idea

624
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,329
Are you still busy?

625
00:57:56,354 --> 00:57:58,133
Where are you going?

626
00:57:58,158 --> 00:57:58,962
Hold on

627
00:58:01,221 --> 00:58:03,135
What's wrong about Sugano?

628
00:58:09,954 --> 00:58:11,751
Congratulations

629
00:58:12,023 --> 00:58:13,148
Congratulations

630
00:58:13,382 --> 00:58:14,710
Congratulations

631
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:20,419
Congratulations

632
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:23,145
I just got a call for you

633
00:58:26,934 --> 00:58:28,958
From Mitsuharu Sugano

634
00:58:29,872 --> 00:58:32,708
he called from haneda airport.
He'll call you again

635
00:58:33,810 --> 00:58:34,740
What's wrong?

636
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:37,342
Well

637
00:58:38,225 --> 00:58:40,490
Talk to me after you meet IMURA-sensei

638
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:42,271
I know nothing about it

639
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:43,310
No comment?

640
00:58:43,428 --> 00:58:44,568
Tell me something

641
00:58:44,593 --> 00:58:45,592
Stop talking to me

642
00:58:46,357 --> 00:58:47,014
Sugano

643
00:58:49,514 --> 00:58:52,810
Where are you staying?

644
00:58:58,275 --> 00:59:01,822
I learned about you on the plane.

645
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:08,462
I never imagined being caught by a newspaper reporter.
Thanks for helping me

646
00:59:09,048 --> 00:59:11,376
you're going to have a hard time

647
00:59:11,900 --> 00:59:13,197
Where are you staying?

648
00:59:13,759 --> 00:59:15,212
I haven't decided yet

649
00:59:16,611 --> 00:59:17,728
Come to my hotel

650
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:18,822
I feel sorry

651
00:59:18,853 --> 00:59:21,642
You should stay at my hotel to get away from the newspaper reporters.

652
00:59:24,258 --> 00:59:27,188
do you doubt me too?

653
00:59:27,828 --> 00:59:30,422
I trust you

654
00:59:31,298 --> 00:59:35,697
I just want to make sure you're not plagiarizing.

655
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:39,540
It's strange that this design got votes at the same time

656
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:43,743
That's an original idea that I came up with for the encore.

657
00:59:44,103 --> 00:59:45,486
I didn't steal

658
00:59:45,511 --> 00:59:46,540
Calm down

659
00:59:46,565 --> 00:59:48,165
I get upset

660
00:59:48,768 --> 00:59:50,487
he feels same as you

661
00:59:53,046 --> 00:59:57,069
People think our company stole IDEA

662
00:59:58,022 --> 00:59:59,858
He got shocked more than you got

663
01:00:01,714 --> 01:00:02,706
Sorry

664
01:00:12,975 --> 01:00:13,936
Welcome home

665
01:00:14,451 --> 01:00:15,686
What's wrong

666
01:00:15,998 --> 01:00:20,014
Could you check if there is a man outside the window?

667
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:25,911
Yes there is

668
01:00:32,342 --> 01:00:34,209
I know that man

669
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:40,131
Shall I call a police?

670
01:00:40,156 --> 01:00:43,131
He was just chasing me

671
01:00:43,467 --> 01:00:44,366
But...

672
01:00:45,757 --> 01:00:49,281
I understand he is in Japan.

673
01:00:50,741 --> 01:00:51,812
Did you meet him?

674
01:00:53,821 --> 01:00:54,540
Why?

675
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,040
He seems to be busy

676
01:00:59,165 --> 01:01:00,274
you can meet him tomorrow

677
01:01:00,508 --> 01:01:01,149
Yeah

678
01:01:01,516 --> 01:01:03,485
Be sure to meet him

679
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:07,225
I want to go with you, but I won't

680
01:01:08,124 --> 01:01:09,897
Be sure to meet him

681
01:01:14,091 --> 01:01:15,263
Is this oK?

682
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:16,638
Thanks

683
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:18,794
This message is for you

684
01:01:19,067 --> 01:01:20,380
Thanks

685
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:34,470
I told him you would be right back but he left this message and left

686
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,455
Thanks

687
01:01:46,463 --> 01:01:52,939
All day yesterday a newspaper reporter chased me and didn't have time to contact you.

688
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:59,706
If I meet you at the company, I can only talk a little.

689
01:02:00,495 --> 01:02:06,597
i think we have to talk for a long time

690
01:02:07,398 --> 01:02:10,382
I don't care if you get mad at me

691
01:02:11,663 --> 01:02:17,968
I will be waiting for you at my hotel from around 4 o'clock.

692
01:02:19,064 --> 01:02:20,580
Please come

693
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:41,416
Elina

694
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:43,142
It's been a age

695
01:02:45,817 --> 01:02:46,668
when did you come to japan?

696
01:02:47,067 --> 01:02:50,981
This morning.
I thought you went out because you weren't in the room

697
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:58,356
I decided to go to Germany for a while

698
01:02:59,902 --> 01:03:00,567
to Germany?

699
01:03:00,988 --> 01:03:03,770
I will study at a German university

700
01:03:42,663 --> 01:03:44,998
i have an appointment with my father

701
01:03:45,608 --> 01:03:46,217
I see

702
01:03:46,342 --> 01:03:47,436
See you

703
01:04:01,613 --> 01:04:02,449
Madam

704
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,683
Madam

705
01:04:08,004 --> 01:04:09,996
Why you are here?

706
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,152
Hold on

707
01:04:13,146 --> 01:04:17,100
do you really think he plagiarized?

708
01:04:19,214 --> 01:04:21,042
I'm here to talk about it

709
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:22,987
It's none of your business

710
01:04:24,245 --> 01:04:25,198
Excuse me

711
01:04:25,456 --> 01:04:26,870
Please listen

712
01:04:28,390 --> 01:04:32,538
i know some truth

713
01:04:33,648 --> 01:04:34,562
I'm not lying you

714
01:04:46,546 --> 01:04:49,343
If a woman named SAWANO comes, please give this to her.

715
01:04:49,531 --> 01:04:50,351
I get it

716
01:04:53,906 --> 01:04:57,664
Are you saying you have proof that he plagiarized?

717
01:04:58,319 --> 01:04:59,796
I don't mean that

718
01:05:00,249 --> 01:05:02,905
What do you know?

719
01:05:03,577 --> 01:05:07,108
you look so scary.
i won't attack you

720
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:08,874
Tell me now

721
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:12,982
What are your thoughts on his plagiarism case??

722
01:05:13,450 --> 01:05:15,974
he's not the type to do that

723
01:05:17,021 --> 01:05:19,068
That what I thought

724
01:05:20,154 --> 01:05:21,661
You're right

725
01:05:23,575 --> 01:05:27,129
he is innocent

726
01:05:27,771 --> 01:05:29,802
why do you say such things?

727
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:31,255
i have the proof

728
01:05:32,805 --> 01:05:34,805
I'll let you see it now if you want to see it

729
01:05:36,141 --> 01:05:36,962
Wanna see?

730
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:42,305
but there is a trade-off

731
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:43,735
What it is?

732
01:05:45,911 --> 01:05:48,317
Will you be my wife?

733
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:51,450
Don't get surprised so much

734
01:05:52,153 --> 01:05:55,247
I can control his architect's life

735
01:05:56,396 --> 01:06:00,333
I won't reveal this secret easily

736
01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:01,763
I want you

737
01:06:01,788 --> 01:06:02,607
Stop it

738
01:06:02,632 --> 01:06:03,403
Please

739
01:06:03,592 --> 01:06:07,210
Please be my wife for one night

740
01:06:07,499 --> 01:06:10,178
Please go home.
I'll call someone

741
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:11,866
Go ahead

742
01:06:12,749 --> 01:06:16,671
i like you so I’m not afraid to be embarrassed

743
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:20,866
I'm really serious

744
01:06:21,162 --> 01:06:23,186
i want to dedicate my life to you

745
01:06:23,211 --> 01:06:25,194
Please stop it

746
01:06:26,546 --> 01:06:27,358
Sis

747
01:06:28,741 --> 01:06:30,171
What the hell?

748
01:06:34,975 --> 01:06:36,163
Excuse me

749
01:06:41,061 --> 01:06:46,405
he came again.
the air in the room is dirty

750
01:06:51,827 --> 01:06:52,460
Oh

751
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:00,936
Brother is there

752
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:03,476
Brother is there

753
01:07:03,538 --> 01:07:06,132
I think you have him confused with someone else.

754
01:07:06,157 --> 01:07:07,929
Did you meet him today?

755
01:07:09,046 --> 01:07:10,765
He must be bros

756
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:12,991
He doesn't have to come

757
01:07:13,648 --> 01:07:15,413
How do you know?

758
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,089
Bros!

759
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:26,753
Bros!

760
01:07:36,048 --> 01:07:37,127
Bros!

761
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:46,675
Tell me the reason

762
01:07:48,456 --> 01:07:52,386
I don't want to bother you any more

763
01:07:53,182 --> 01:07:54,761
that's a very old idea

764
01:07:55,776 --> 01:07:59,386
If you leave the company now, you have admitted plagiarism.

765
01:08:01,180 --> 01:08:02,391
You may be right

766
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:04,719
why don't you fight?

767
01:08:06,039 --> 01:08:09,344
i don't feel like that

768
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:11,446
What?

769
01:08:12,852 --> 01:08:17,821
i want to start all over again

770
01:08:18,008 --> 01:08:19,789
don't be sentimental

771
01:08:20,986 --> 01:08:26,189
It can't be helped that you don't understand my feelings

772
01:08:27,998 --> 01:08:31,100
I met Shiozawa-san and Erina-san last night.

773
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:36,302
Did you know they were in Tokyo?

774
01:08:36,568 --> 01:08:38,139
Yes I knew

775
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:41,553
Did you know he's staying at the same hotel?

776
01:08:44,304 --> 01:08:45,062
I see

777
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:55,023
do you still love him?

778
01:08:57,210 --> 01:08:58,343
Or

779
01:09:00,952 --> 01:09:03,468
That's good for you

780
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:08,452
I have worried about you from time to time.

781
01:09:08,913 --> 01:09:09,874
Sorry

782
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:12,742
That's good for you

783
01:09:13,804 --> 01:09:17,820
He is a problem in this plagiarism case.

784
01:09:18,432 --> 01:09:20,080
He didn't

785
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:23,987
He is not one of those people.

786
01:09:25,471 --> 01:09:26,291
Really?

787
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:33,268
I am determined to give up on him

788
01:09:33,943 --> 01:09:36,755
I still have mixed feelings actually.

789
01:09:37,817 --> 01:09:45,419
I came back from Cambodia and suffered a lot from that.

790
01:09:47,412 --> 01:09:51,365
I don't give up on him because he plagiarized.

791
01:09:51,709 --> 01:09:53,013
What do you mean?

792
01:09:54,718 --> 01:10:00,710
i don't despise men like you

793
01:10:02,091 --> 01:10:04,411
Actually your lover...

794
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,365
That's not true

795
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:13,107
he's just unlucky in life

796
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:15,779
That's what I thought

797
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,716
I accept his humanity

798
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,222
what are you going to do now?

799
01:10:26,504 --> 01:10:30,215
I want to live in a rural area away from Tokyo.

800
01:10:33,394 --> 01:10:36,168
I think I can do things like shop design

801
01:10:38,309 --> 01:10:41,449
i can't even stay in a hotel

802
01:10:42,129 --> 01:10:44,051
It's time to say good bye

803
01:10:44,076 --> 01:10:45,465
Hold on

804
01:10:47,738 --> 01:10:50,652
i want to support you

805
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:53,004
What?

806
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:58,480
how would you like to work abroad?

807
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:00,509
But

808
01:11:00,806 --> 01:11:06,017
I have an acquaintance at the University of Hamburg in Germany, so why don't you study there for a while?

809
01:11:08,742 --> 01:11:10,726
you won't be lonely

810
01:11:11,812 --> 01:11:12,742
I won't but

811
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:22,421
What do you think about it?
It's easy

812
01:11:34,175 --> 01:11:34,917
Excuse me

813
01:11:35,331 --> 01:11:36,660
Are you Sawano?

814
01:11:37,183 --> 01:11:38,542
Yes I am

815
01:11:39,503 --> 01:11:41,152
I'm Mistuyo Murata

816
01:11:42,597 --> 01:11:44,839
I was Kadokura's wife

817
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:48,097
don't be so surprised

818
01:11:49,769 --> 01:11:50,675
But

819
01:11:51,355 --> 01:11:52,035
What?

820
01:11:53,378 --> 01:11:55,355
i heard his wife died

821
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:00,988
you believed it to be true?

822
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:08,137
I have a favor to ask from you

823
01:12:08,871 --> 01:12:10,356
about his son

824
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:13,660
my son too

825
01:12:14,434 --> 01:12:15,457
About your son?

826
01:12:16,738 --> 01:12:20,442
Last night he came to me drunk

827
01:12:21,488 --> 01:12:27,035
he blamed himself

828
01:12:27,232 --> 01:12:28,779
that's what he often says

829
01:12:30,115 --> 01:12:33,615
I got argue with him

830
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:36,467
But he didn't go home

831
01:12:38,123 --> 01:12:41,115
I think he's gone to home country

832
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:42,826
to home country?

833
01:12:44,256 --> 01:12:48,842
i don't worry about him but i have a kid

834
01:12:49,623 --> 01:12:51,209
i want you to take care of him

835
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:52,350
Me?

836
01:12:54,295 --> 01:12:55,654
Why me?

837
01:12:56,381 --> 01:12:59,514
i have a husband now

838
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:01,022
it's not convenient for me

839
01:13:02,014 --> 01:13:04,608
But he is your son

840
01:13:05,045 --> 01:13:07,967
he hates me.
he runs away when i go see him

841
01:13:08,506 --> 01:13:10,123
but I’m in trouble

842
01:13:11,318 --> 01:13:12,647
i have nothing to do with him

843
01:13:13,334 --> 01:13:15,733
I don't think so

844
01:13:18,209 --> 01:13:20,311
i don't blame you

845
01:13:21,092 --> 01:13:26,334
he seems to really like you

846
01:13:26,834 --> 01:13:28,076
No way

847
01:13:28,272 --> 01:13:32,467
He may be joking, but he said he would go home and commit suicide.

848
01:13:34,397 --> 01:13:35,295
Suicide?

849
01:13:35,943 --> 01:13:37,756
that's his catchphrase

850
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:41,522
Please aspect my favor

851
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:47,498
I can't handle him.
This is something small

852
01:13:49,778 --> 01:13:50,848
Hold on

853
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,247
Thank you

854
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:05,528
Did you decided to go to Germany?

855
01:14:05,927 --> 01:14:09,067
Not yet, so I'm here to talk about it

856
01:14:12,552 --> 01:14:15,943
The University of Hamburg is one of the world's leading universities in architecture

857
01:14:17,029 --> 01:14:19,388
i dreamed of studying there

858
01:14:20,357 --> 01:14:23,802
I'm worried about Shiozawa-san supporting me.

859
01:14:24,763 --> 01:14:29,099
It's been so hard for me to be in the country side for a few years.

860
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,161
It's great to be able to go to the University of Hamburg.

861
01:14:34,607 --> 01:14:38,122
That's good that rich people support you

862
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:39,645
You are so mean

863
01:14:39,670 --> 01:14:40,271
Shut up

864
01:14:40,622 --> 01:14:41,513
Fujikawa

865
01:14:44,427 --> 01:14:45,997
do you really think so?

866
01:14:47,583 --> 01:14:51,700
What the hell you are talking about,Sugano?

867
01:14:52,161 --> 01:14:56,115
Are you thinking of Yoko?

868
01:14:57,091 --> 01:15:03,255
You won't tell me about Yoko

869
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:06,466
you are so cowardly

870
01:15:08,052 --> 01:15:13,122
I tried to tell you, but I couldn't tell you

871
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:21,116
Yoko and I have no more chances

872
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:22,014
Don't say bullshit

873
01:15:22,577 --> 01:15:24,429
Don't be loud

874
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:34,537
i don't know what happened to you guys in Cambodia.
you guys believed in each other so much

875
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:38,530
You guys are lying about something.

876
01:15:39,421 --> 01:15:41,022
Be strong!

877
01:15:41,514 --> 01:15:42,233
Fujikawa

878
01:15:42,405 --> 01:15:49,554
Are you going to leave Yoko and go abroad with a sponsor from a rich person?

879
01:15:50,725 --> 01:15:52,147
Say something!

880
01:15:52,577 --> 01:15:53,170
Calm down

881
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:54,131
Shut up!

882
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:59,389
There is something he doesn't know, so you should explain it to him.

883
01:16:01,321 --> 01:16:03,454
Ok I tell him.
Come on,Chikako

884
01:16:12,957 --> 01:16:13,731
Chikako

885
01:16:14,317 --> 01:16:15,254
Have a seat

886
01:16:15,863 --> 01:16:19,629
she didn't go see you because she was feeling well

887
01:16:21,379 --> 01:16:22,965
Why you are here?

888
01:16:23,348 --> 01:16:25,973
Yoko is not in Tokyo now

889
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:27,801
She is not?

890
01:16:27,903 --> 01:16:29,504
She was in Hokuriku by train a while ago.

891
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:30,926
To Hokuriiku?

892
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,989
To the Noto Peninsula

893
01:16:33,465 --> 01:16:36,059
why does she go there?

894
01:16:37,254 --> 01:16:40,918
i will talk about it
please read this before

895
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:51,959
I had to go to Noto Peninsula with Mr. Kadokura's child.

896
01:16:53,115 --> 01:16:55,576
Ask chikako the reason

897
01:16:57,739 --> 01:17:03,653
I don't want to see him, but I have to go for my child's sake.

898
01:17:05,161 --> 01:17:11,614
This trip could be the end of our love affair.

899
01:17:14,404 --> 01:17:17,443
Mr. Fujikawa and others has encouraged me a lot.

900
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:23,740
My love did not win Mitsuharu-san over.

901
01:17:24,591 --> 01:17:26,482
i am going to give up

902
01:17:27,685 --> 01:17:31,435
i feel so miserable now

903
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:50,357
Only our vehicle went to Wajima.

904
01:17:52,115 --> 01:17:57,170
Wajima is a town at the tip of the Noto Peninsula in the Sea of Japan.

905
01:17:58,037 --> 01:18:03,709
there it's cloudy like my heart

906
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,362
Excuse me

907
01:18:09,088 --> 01:18:09,791
What can I do for you?

908
01:18:10,284 --> 01:18:14,573
Is this the house of Rokutaro Kadokura's older brother?

909
01:18:16,198 --> 01:18:17,760
Yes this is

910
01:18:21,104 --> 01:18:23,370
Oh Toshibo

911
01:18:24,471 --> 01:18:26,534
Where's Kadokura?

912
01:18:27,541 --> 01:18:30,705
he is working now.
Hey Rokutaro

913
01:18:31,315 --> 01:18:32,120
Rokutaro

914
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,409
Rokutaro

915
01:18:36,909 --> 01:18:38,143
Please come in

916
01:18:43,919 --> 01:18:45,029
Stupid

917
01:18:45,419 --> 01:18:49,154
I don't know her but she brought him

918
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:51,896
you are a terrible father

919
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:53,193
welcome

920
01:19:03,169 --> 01:19:05,208
i wanted to make you suffer

921
01:19:07,052 --> 01:19:09,958
I tried to make you suffer by pretending to commit suicide

922
01:19:12,615 --> 01:19:15,271
I never imagined you would come here

923
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:20,365
I only came here because I feel sorry for him.

924
01:19:20,419 --> 01:19:25,224
You saw right through my methods.

925
01:19:26,205 --> 01:19:27,635
I'm sorry

926
01:19:30,439 --> 01:19:32,463
I'm so bad man

927
01:19:35,351 --> 01:19:39,780
As an apology, I will share with you the truth about SUGANO's plagiarism case.

928
01:19:42,830 --> 01:19:47,190
I used to want to be an architect

929
01:19:50,182 --> 01:19:54,955
Two years ago there was a design competition for the National Concert Hall.

930
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:58,948
I submitted a work that took me a year to make.

931
01:20:00,479 --> 01:20:02,776
I devoted my life to the work

932
01:20:04,955 --> 01:20:06,432
i was confident

933
01:20:08,846 --> 01:20:12,518
The result was I came in second.

934
01:20:13,948 --> 01:20:15,815
But far from 1 place

935
01:20:18,166 --> 01:20:24,596
Sugano took the first place

936
01:20:28,579 --> 01:20:31,017
I was surprised to see his work

937
01:20:32,751 --> 01:20:34,486
I fully admitted my defeat

938
01:20:36,603 --> 01:20:38,579
since then i threw it all away

939
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:44,048
i became poor and my wife left me

940
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:51,017
I went to your house and saw the blueprints on the wall.

941
01:20:52,239 --> 01:20:53,669
That was great work

942
01:20:54,848 --> 01:20:57,419
I just found out that is Sugano's work

943
01:20:58,768 --> 01:21:03,400
and you were your lover

944
01:21:05,332 --> 01:21:06,715
I got jealous of you

945
01:21:10,246 --> 01:21:14,418
I was jealous of his job and his lover

946
01:21:15,676 --> 01:21:19,324
I totally hated him.

947
01:21:22,224 --> 01:21:23,997
The plagiarism trap was simple.

948
01:21:26,388 --> 01:21:32,708
I coped his design.
And I asked my American friend to publish it

949
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:35,182
That's all

950
01:21:35,861 --> 01:21:37,744
So you are

951
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:41,260
I'm the criminal

952
01:21:43,856 --> 01:21:45,254
Please tell him

953
01:21:47,184 --> 01:21:51,457
This will prove he is innocent.

954
01:21:53,254 --> 01:21:56,098
Ok, I'll tell him

955
01:21:57,606 --> 01:21:59,254
Thanks for telling me

956
01:22:03,297 --> 01:22:07,547
I don't get it why he's going to Germany

957
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:12,985
I hear A supporter paid him

958
01:22:14,555 --> 01:22:16,688
He leaves you here and go

959
01:22:18,196 --> 01:22:21,821
I don't know why you are ok

960
01:22:29,459 --> 01:22:30,482
Madam?

961
01:23:04,073 --> 01:23:06,979
He's gone for Yagura hot spring

962
01:23:07,722 --> 01:23:08,511
I see

963
01:23:08,776 --> 01:23:09,542
What's wrong?

964
01:23:09,948 --> 01:23:12,472
I'm guessing Sawano visited here yesterday

965
01:23:13,729 --> 01:23:19,144
She stayed at Fujiya inn and go back by first train

966
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,746
She's from Tokyo,right?

967
01:23:28,473 --> 01:23:31,379
She told me she took a bus

968
01:23:31,762 --> 01:23:33,950
Bus? not a train?

969
01:23:34,325 --> 01:23:38,645
She wanted to see sea side.
She took a bus that depart 8 am

970
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:41,700
What for?

971
01:23:42,985 --> 01:23:48,398
She told me the sea was very clam more than I thought

972
01:23:48,829 --> 01:23:56,687
I taught her Sosogi beach.
The waters there are rough, but she said she wanted to see it.

973
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:48,258
Yoko!

974
01:24:57,096 --> 01:24:58,753
Yoko!

975
01:25:08,193 --> 01:25:08,959
Yoko!

976
01:25:21,821 --> 01:25:23,047
Yoko!

977
01:25:28,112 --> 01:25:30,276
Where you've come here?

978
01:25:35,153 --> 01:25:37,434
Let's go back

979
01:25:39,583 --> 01:25:41,895
You got wetting

980
01:26:01,851 --> 01:26:04,905
I need to tell you something

981
01:26:07,683 --> 01:26:11,269
Kadokura committed plagiarism.

982
01:26:13,714 --> 01:26:14,902
Kadokura committed plagiarism.?

983
01:26:15,394 --> 01:26:17,331
He told me that

984
01:26:18,394 --> 01:26:21,456
So You'll be innocent

985
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:23,410
I see

986
01:26:23,816 --> 01:26:32,518
When I return to Tokyo, I will tell you about it and congratulate you.

987
01:26:33,964 --> 01:26:37,386
That's not important to me now

988
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:42,410
I was worried about plagiarism and was thinking of going to Germany.

989
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:45,042
I was so mad

990
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:49,191
I was thinking that without making an effort to meet you

991
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:52,808
Fujikawa scold me about that

992
01:26:52,925 --> 01:26:55,136
You won't go to Germany?

993
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:56,433
Yeah

994
01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:00,464
Why You won't go to Germany?

995
01:27:03,058 --> 01:27:06,167
I will not go abroad without you.

996
01:27:06,558 --> 01:27:07,519
You should go

997
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:10,714
you will regret it in the future

998
01:27:11,191 --> 01:27:12,785
What are you saying?

999
01:27:13,472 --> 01:27:15,956
you don't need to turn it down for me

1000
01:27:16,066 --> 01:27:18,410
Don't get me wrong

1001
01:27:19,847 --> 01:27:21,738
Why you don't understand what I feel?

1002
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:25,027
Yoko!

1003
01:27:43,628 --> 01:27:49,589
I ask you again,
Are you Ok not to meet Sugano any more?

1004
01:27:51,093 --> 01:27:53,116
You can't wait for him?

1005
01:28:11,044 --> 01:28:15,786
I believed you would visit me at that night

1006
01:28:16,357 --> 01:28:19,755
I worried and I waited until 8.pm

1007
01:28:20,482 --> 01:28:22,919
But you didn't come

1008
01:28:23,771 --> 01:28:26,310
I thought you declined me

1009
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:28,638
I couldn't wait to see you

1010
01:28:29,615 --> 01:28:31,310
There was a light in your room

1011
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:35,622
I was afraid to come in

1012
01:28:37,396 --> 01:28:40,622
I visited your hotel at the night

1013
01:28:46,138 --> 01:28:51,161
After seeing you at the encore, I was very distressed.

1014
01:28:52,076 --> 01:28:56,302
I resented you and blamed myself.

1015
01:28:56,904 --> 01:28:59,802
I wanted to give it all up.

1016
01:29:01,513 --> 01:29:08,177
I made up my mind to see you again when I read the letter

1017
01:29:10,154 --> 01:29:12,294
I came to the hotel at the appointed time

1018
01:29:13,279 --> 01:29:16,794
But You were with Elina

1019
01:29:17,865 --> 01:29:19,005
You've come

1020
01:29:19,591 --> 01:29:21,919
I felt miserable and went back

1021
01:29:23,646 --> 01:29:26,880
I made up my mind not to see you any more

1022
01:29:28,122 --> 01:29:32,576
It was very surprising to me that Erina-san was there at that time.

1023
01:29:34,458 --> 01:29:36,099
I feel same way

1024
01:29:37,078 --> 01:29:38,950
But Why?

1025
01:29:40,974 --> 01:29:45,161
I lost my confidence.
We won't get along well

1026
01:29:45,263 --> 01:29:46,560
I don't think so

1027
01:29:46,794 --> 01:29:50,802
The coincidence that you met ELINA is very shocking to me.

1028
01:29:51,068 --> 01:29:57,701
I had that feeling too when I was you and Elsa at the encore.

1029
01:29:58,466 --> 01:30:00,786
Don't get me wrong!
Be strong

1030
01:30:01,411 --> 01:30:03,107
And believe in me

1031
01:30:04,958 --> 01:30:09,740
I was thinking all the time on the train.
i hurt you so much

1032
01:30:10,232 --> 01:30:12,490
But forgive me

1033
01:30:13,029 --> 01:30:14,661
I really need you

1034
01:30:23,921 --> 01:30:26,296
I really need you

1035
01:30:41,568 --> 01:30:44,584
Did you tell her?
Our father is in critical condition.

1036
01:30:44,998 --> 01:30:46,881
I called her company and they told me she's gone for Noto

1037
01:30:48,271 --> 01:30:49,670
She's not here.
I have no way to get her back

1038
01:30:50,686 --> 01:30:52,857
Our  father is in critical condition.

1039
01:30:53,342 --> 01:30:56,350
Officially She is My wife.
Please call her now

1040
01:31:42,369 --> 01:31:46,963
THE END

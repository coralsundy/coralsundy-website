2
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,617
Meiji 38 (Year 1905)

3
00:00:59,773 --> 00:01:00,547
It hurts.

4
00:01:02,543 --> 00:01:04,741
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:10,893 --> 00:01:15,390
It's embarrassing for the neighbors,
You have to stop

6
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,023
Hey.

7
00:01:23,075 --> 00:01:28,304
Stop doing that because it's not a nuisance to the neighbors.

8
00:01:29,986 --> 00:01:35,999
She was holding hands with Shin, the fishmonger.

9
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:37,132
What?

10
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:40,156
And she was so happy that she kicked the iron kettle

11
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,178
I almost got burned.

12
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:44,710
You are stupid.

13
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,163
You are still a brat

14
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:49,305
Don't show off your charm.

15
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,413
But I didn't do anything.
Shinchan did it.

16
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,695
Don't make excuses.

17
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,585
If you have time to go out and have fun, work hard

18
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:03,538
I take care a baby and kitchen

19
00:02:03,817 --> 00:02:05,749
Don't make excuses.

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:10,382
But I've never gone to bed earlier than 12 o'clock at night

21
00:02:11,065 --> 00:02:12,858
But you did something wrong.

22
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,541
Forgive me....

23
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:17,584
I won't do it any more.

24
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,725
Are you sure?

25
00:02:22,249 --> 00:02:23,898
She's so sassy.

26
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:26,780
We had a troublesome person come to our house.

27
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,656
But She's my younger brother's only child.

28
00:02:30,655 --> 00:02:32,466
She has no parents.

29
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,889
You say that but

30
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,538
Are you not planning to sell her to a geisha?

31
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:39,030
Right?

32
00:02:39,327 --> 00:02:40,944
I feel sorry for her.

33
00:02:42,593 --> 00:02:48,340
Besides, Shinbashi and Yanagibashi say it's troublesome
because her guarantor stuff.

34
00:02:48,908 --> 00:02:50,405
You don't think about anything.

35
00:02:51,115 --> 00:02:53,093
our house is on fire

36
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,792
What will you do if this child grows up?

37
00:02:58,791 --> 00:03:00,296
I know.

38
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:05,535
If you know, you're not in a good mood to be drinking.

39
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:07,678
You bastard!

40
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,656
Did you go to see the lantern procession?

41
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:21,047
Please wash my clothes too.

42
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,398
Help yourself.

43
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,007
You're a freeloader, yet you act all high and mighty.

44
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:31,685
This Kimono is mine. My mom bought it for me before she died

45
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,663
I wore this a long time ago before I came here.

46
00:03:33,688 --> 00:03:35,366
It's none of my business.

47
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,788
Don't wear it.

48
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,820
Kei hit me!

49
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,390
What?
Again?

50
00:04:03,955 --> 00:04:04,960
Get out again.

51
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,428
Don't ever come back

52
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:27,083
<i>Onna no Issho / Life of a Woman (1962)</i>

53
00:05:54,914 --> 00:05:55,813
Son.

54
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,649
If we defeat Russia and withdraw from Manchuria, your inner palace will be safe

55
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,360
We avoid becoming a Russian colony

56
00:06:03,524 --> 00:06:05,297
Japanese military is strong enough.

57
00:06:06,027 --> 00:06:07,485
The Japanese military has the Yamato spirit.

58
00:06:09,938 --> 00:06:11,009
No.

59
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,008
Because Japan is a modern nation

60
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,586
A preemptive nation like Russia is no good.

61
00:06:16,938 --> 00:06:18,102
My country is no good either.

62
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,620
We must overthrow the Qing government and bring about reforms.

63
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,063
Is it a revolution?

64
00:06:24,371 --> 00:06:27,883
We are finally here! The sleeping lion is roaring.

65
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:30,360
I'm home.

66
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,071
Welcome back

67
00:06:42,095 --> 00:06:43,196
I'm home.

68
00:06:48,252 --> 00:06:48,936
Good evening

69
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:50,259
Welcome

70
00:06:50,569 --> 00:06:52,600
Are you studying?

71
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,172
Has your Japanese improved?

72
00:06:54,197 --> 00:06:55,970
Yes I'm studying hard.

73
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:57,759
He's really good

74
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,078
Your father in Tianjin is worried about you

75
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:04,399
He said you haven't written me recently.

76
00:07:04,773 --> 00:07:07,429
He is young and busy with various things.

77
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:12,922
As your guarantor, I am also responsible for
supervising you, so that would be a problem

78
00:07:13,343 --> 00:07:17,055
You need to cherish your parents more

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,440
Mom, this is your birthday present

80
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,798
Thank you very much.

81
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,508
It's a beautiful comb

82
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:29,150
But it seems a bit too flashy for your mother

83
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,399
But I really like it, so maybe not?

84
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:38,211
I'm really happy.

85
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,664
I'm happy about your feelings.

86
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:43,966
I made it.

87
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:49,986
I see, the painting looks a lot better than the real.

88
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,633
but he said he'd give it to me as a gift

89
00:07:53,635 --> 00:07:57,328
It's pretty well done, you're lucky

90
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,703
Besides these two wonderful sons,

91
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,746
You have two beautiful daughters.

92
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,656
If only my father were still alive,

93
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,914
Don't be so greedy.

94
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:13,563
The Mitsui Industries he founded prospered through trade with China.

95
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,946
That's quite good.

96
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,750
He was a really great man

97
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:24,289
His success was in the First Sino-Japanese War,

98
00:08:24,642 --> 00:08:29,020
in which he defeated Russia
It will become easier to trade

99
00:08:29,711 --> 00:08:35,170
Let's work together with Son's father to expand the business.

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,516
The fruits are here

101
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,123
Thank you very much.
Seizo.

102
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,852
No, I love this kind of thing.

103
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:51,938
so this looks good

104
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,758
He is a hardworking banker.

105
00:08:55,957 --> 00:09:00,133
He will take care of you for the rest of his life.

106
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,946
When will you have a baby?

107
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:03,884
I have no idea.

108
00:09:04,462 --> 00:09:07,901
Instead of that, you should find your bride.

109
00:09:08,202 --> 00:09:11,202
There will soon be no more bride.

110
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,555
Good evening, Seizo-san

111
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,125
No, Fumi-san, Thanks.

112
00:09:18,509 --> 00:09:22,115
I'll sing my favorite song to celebrate her birthday

113
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,016
Is that so? That's great

114
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,219
Can you please accompany me?

115
00:09:26,595 --> 00:09:27,516
But...

116
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,485
but I'm begging you

117
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,641
It's for my mother

118
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:00,802
Wait a minute

119
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:05,905
Who are you?

120
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:10,638
Where did you come from?

121
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:15,451
The wooden gate to the garden over there was open

122
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:17,614
Did you come in quietly

123
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,998
You came to get the comb.

124
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,943
sorry

125
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,224
I didn't mean to take it

126
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:32,599
I just thought it was so pretty

127
00:12:33,911 --> 00:12:34,896
so I gave it back

128
00:12:35,653 --> 00:12:37,488
Here, please take it.

129
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:40,599
Forgive me....

130
00:12:43,068 --> 00:12:44,576
Forgive me....

131
00:12:45,169 --> 00:12:47,785
I'll do anything you ask me to do

132
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,958
You could hold my hand.

133
00:12:55,699 --> 00:12:56,810
Stop it.

134
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:01,091
It hurts.

135
00:13:05,365 --> 00:13:06,982
You're so violent.

136
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,170
Come in.

137
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,036
Mom, I feel so sorry for this girl.

138
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,380
She ran away from home because her uncle kept interfering with er life

139
00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:29,905
You've known her for a while?

140
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:32,930
No, that's not it.
I was wrong.

141
00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:35,325
I left the wooden gate to the garden open,

142
00:13:35,437 --> 00:13:37,247
so she must have come through there

143
00:13:37,404 --> 00:13:38,271
What's the hell?

144
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:39,872
Mother

145
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,125
Today is also her birthday, just like my mother's

146
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,474
Do you have no mother?

147
00:13:47,517 --> 00:13:48,849
My mother has died.

148
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:50,021
How about your dad?

149
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:51,708
My father died in the war.

150
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:53,451
I see.

151
00:13:54,029 --> 00:13:55,420
 It was the last war

152
00:13:55,874 --> 00:13:58,874
The Sino-Japanese?
Where?

153
00:13:59,263 --> 00:14:00,677
It was Taito Ward

154
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,568
that's where I got injured.

155
00:14:04,489 --> 00:14:06,638
What group did your father belong to?

156
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,775
I don't know

157
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,857
I was still young

158
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:14,732
so please

159
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:18,181
Please don't take me to the police.

160
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:21,450
I'm never going into a stranger's house again.

161
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,489
Don't worry.

162
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,778
I won't tell the police

163
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,190
so hurry up and go home.

164
00:14:28,494 --> 00:14:30,536
I'm sure they are worried about you.

165
00:14:30,854 --> 00:14:33,458
Maybe no one in her house is worried about her.

166
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,723
Your Uncles and aunties

167
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:38,644
I'm sure they are feeling sorry for what they've done

168
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,482
and is searching for you

169
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:44,732
I'm not saying anything bad, so hurry up and go home.

170
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,630
Shall I send someone to you?

171
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,903
No, I'm fine alone

172
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,496
So be careful

173
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,802
Please come and visit us again at lunchtime

174
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:07,770
Yes sorry

175
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:11,517
Goodbye.

176
00:15:11,701 --> 00:15:12,919
Goodbye.

177
00:15:19,485 --> 00:15:23,568
Sis...the world is full of variety

178
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,660
I lost my legs in the war.

179
00:15:28,391 --> 00:15:29,582
Thanks to the war,

180
00:15:29,607 --> 00:15:31,278
I was successful in business

181
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:35,333
You get birthday celebrations from children

182
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:42,091
There are also people who lost their fathers in the same war.
There is someone who has the same birthday as her.

183
00:15:55,643 --> 00:15:57,721
Hey, wait a minute

184
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:06,672
I'll give this to you,

185
00:16:17,746 --> 00:16:20,010
what happened to you?

186
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:27,557
I can't go home.

187
00:16:31,028 --> 00:16:32,455
I have nowhere to go.

188
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:36,730
They told me never coming back

189
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,534
Meiji 43 (Year 1910)

190
00:17:36,673 --> 00:17:38,338
You're always working.

191
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:39,268
Isn't it hard?

192
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:42,268
I don't wanna playing around and I think it's a waste

193
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:44,094
You're not a maid anymore

194
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,135
I gave my uncle money

195
00:17:46,221 --> 00:17:48,565
and you have clearly adopted me as his daughter,

196
00:17:48,997 --> 00:17:50,510
so I don't have to work that much

197
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,497
I'm very happy the way it is

198
00:17:53,764 --> 00:17:57,065
It's like a dream, it's all thanks to you.

199
00:17:57,471 --> 00:17:58,573
Are you leaving now?

200
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,018
I'm going out to Kanda

201
00:18:06,605 --> 00:18:09,157
Are you going to buy another law book in Kanda?

202
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,947
It's tough, you have to study that much at university

203
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:15,127
What do you plan to do in the future?

204
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,665
That's right, my father became a continental ronin after his death

205
00:18:19,923 --> 00:18:22,440
I'm afraid I might follow my father's example and become the leader of the demons.

206
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:24,776
What's the hell?

207
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,036
So then

208
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,299
What kind of person do you want to be as a wife?

209
00:18:31,447 --> 00:18:34,065
I have never thought about that

210
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:37,572
But I don't want to be the wife of someone who wants to become a demon

211
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,150
Because this is the first time you've done this,

212
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:42,476
You said I could hold your hand.

213
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,065
I don't like it.
It's too late.

214
00:18:45,968 --> 00:18:49,963
At that time, I wanted to do something to avoid being handed over to the police

215
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,947
I was trying my best,

216
00:18:51,979 --> 00:18:54,566
so I just said stuff that came out of my mouth

217
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,822
I didn't know.

218
00:18:55,855 --> 00:18:58,799
I thought you liked me a little bit

219
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,676
I shouldn't have given you the comb.

220
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,516
I'll get this back

221
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,826
That's no good, please give it back

222
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:05,706
No.

223
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:09,583
it like a treasure

224
00:19:10,698 --> 00:19:12,073
I won't give this back to you.

225
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:17,729
Please.

226
00:19:20,432 --> 00:19:21,667
Please.

227
00:19:23,446 --> 00:19:24,963
Welcome back.

228
00:19:28,182 --> 00:19:29,784
I want tea.

229
00:19:31,868 --> 00:19:33,322
I'll give this back.

230
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,604
Have a nice day.

231
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,752
Did you finish the exam today?

232
00:19:56,497 --> 00:19:58,486
 I'm finally graduating.

233
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:03,057
You will finally become the president, replacing your mother.

234
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,636
I don't want to be the president

235
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,856
Why?

236
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,880
You learn Chinese at a foreign language school

237
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,096
to help you with business?

238
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,826
Well, that was my mother's wish

239
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:19,182
I find it interesting to read books that have nothing to do with trade

240
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:26,636
I found that
I was a worthless person to our business

241
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,566
Even though you are the eldest son,

242
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:28,933
You say that.

243
00:20:29,302 --> 00:20:32,288
Does the eldest son have to take up the family business?

244
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,096
If you don't, our house will collapse

245
00:20:35,478 --> 00:20:38,478
I'm a guy who's suited to be a school teacher

246
00:20:38,831 --> 00:20:40,297
The teacher is not stuck

247
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,650
Business is much more interesting

248
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:48,666
Shintaro, on the way home from school, you stopped by the bank?

249
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:52,158
Your wife asked you this morning.

250
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:54,708
Bu I went to ask for a discount on a bill

251
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,994
It just doesn't feel right

252
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,443
Sometimes it's good to go to the bank but...

253
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,041
A bank is a place to borrow money

254
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,752
I will go there tomorrow

255
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,720
You like helping out like a store

256
00:21:10,089 --> 00:21:12,775
Attending the handover of goods to Chinese.

257
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:15,892
I like negotiate at customs.

258
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:16,995
Okei.

259
00:21:18,413 --> 00:21:21,413
Where are you?

260
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:27,690
What can I do for you?

261
00:21:27,918 --> 00:21:32,228
I found Fumi's underwear in my laundry.

262
00:21:32,253 --> 00:21:33,361
I'm so sorry

263
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,756
Please be careful.

264
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,736
I can't stand being lumped together with hers.

265
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,221
Fusako.

266
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,135
I don't want to force anything on her.

267
00:21:41,588 --> 00:21:42,584
Do it yourself.

268
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:43,963
Because..

269
00:21:44,182 --> 00:21:45,096
 you're a woman too

270
00:21:46,158 --> 00:21:47,370
What's wrong with that?

271
00:21:47,854 --> 00:21:49,940
You like Kei so much.

272
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,338
You always protect her.

273
00:21:51,401 --> 00:21:52,292
Fusako.

274
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,560
Fumie is on good terms with Seizo, so you ar frustrated.

275
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,143
So you take your frustrations out on her.

276
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:00,869
you're so mean

277
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,595
Just because okie-san is your favorite,

278
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,908
you're not even bringing that up

279
00:22:05,475 --> 00:22:08,475
Everyone in this house is interested in Kei.

280
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:10,315
I'm jealous of her.

281
00:22:10,641 --> 00:22:14,463
Please stop, I'll be in trouble

282
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,932
I'll take care of the laundry

283
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,643
I'll be more careful from now on

284
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,494
European music is amazing

285
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,066
Right

286
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,486
Japanese music is so poor and primitive that it's not even worth talking about.

287
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,946
Japan needs to become a great power

288
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:38,610
and catch up with Europe soon

289
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:44,482
I want to study abroad in Germany after I graduate from music school next year

290
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,571
that's great

291
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,649
It's so fun talking to you

292
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:54,535
How do you think about Fusako?

293
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:58,466
She's traditional Japanese women

294
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:01,068
There's nothing modern.

295
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,133
Unlike you

296
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,526
I'll tell my sister.

297
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:29,235
Are you going back to China?

298
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,602
Yes.

299
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,716
You had made it into college, but

300
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,020
It's regrettable.

301
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:37,946
There is nothing more to learn from Japan.

302
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,540
But your father gets angry.

303
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:46,070
My father is an enemy of China, just like Japan

304
00:23:46,257 --> 00:23:46,997
Enemy?

305
00:23:48,115 --> 00:23:51,269
My father will also take your mother to make money.

306
00:23:51,786 --> 00:23:56,785
She doesn't care what happens to the Chinese people.

307
00:24:00,746 --> 00:24:01,745
The same goes for Japan

308
00:24:02,663 --> 00:24:07,904
I thought that the Japanese would help China for the sake of China's happiness,

309
00:24:08,581 --> 00:24:09,541
but that's not the case

310
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:13,430
Japan wants to exploit China and get fat on its own

311
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:16,990
Japan wants to imitate the West and colonize Asia.

312
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,002
Watch out!

313
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:30,608
Damn it.
He escaped.

314
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:34,356
Who are you?
What are you planning to do with Son?

315
00:24:36,219 --> 00:24:40,990
That guy is stealing the Japanese government's policies

316
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,402
Are you one of those friends or comrades too?

317
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:45,009
What if I am?

318
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,273
I will report this to the police

319
00:24:49,673 --> 00:24:53,010
stupid.
Do you think the police can arrest us?

320
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:34,844
Sho-san

321
00:25:36,811 --> 00:25:38,031
I finally found your wife.

322
00:25:38,456 --> 00:25:40,503
Why do you think?

323
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:45,590
She's not good enough.

324
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,901
You're not into marriage.

325
00:25:49,857 --> 00:25:52,035
what on earth are you planning?

326
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:55,629
Tenjin ask us to increase product price.
They've said they're going to raise the price of cotton again.

327
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,620
Again?

328
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,790
Is it really difficult to do business with Chinese.

329
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,804
They're black-hearted.

330
00:26:03,024 --> 00:26:04,243
They are clever.

331
00:26:04,526 --> 00:26:06,550
They're also in business

332
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,960
I'm going for a little walk

333
00:26:10,285 --> 00:26:12,536
Sho-san, Go to Tenjin.

334
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:13,737
Go to Tenjin?

335
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,206
I'll get the Ministry of Foreign Affairs involved

336
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:20,421
Sho-san, Please tell Tenjin's lecturer....

337
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,445
I should threaten them and force them to cut down the cotton roots?

338
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,824
Yes, that's right

339
00:26:25,499 --> 00:26:26,883
Sorry, I don't want to do that.

340
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:28,351
Sho-san, please.

341
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,616
Please go to Tenjin.

342
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,141
because you're popular.

343
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,430
But we have to consider not only our interests, but theirs as well.

344
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:43,840
Shosan, What I have to do is to protect our business.

345
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:48,961
The Japanese are a bit arrogant

346
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:53,236
Don't make fun of Chinese just because we won the war

347
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:54,755
I'll do it

348
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,324
Even if you say no.

349
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,465
In my position, I have no choice but to do whatever I want

350
00:27:00,916 --> 00:27:01,663
You hate it?

351
00:27:02,708 --> 00:27:04,298
Ask someone else.

352
00:27:07,851 --> 00:27:09,315
It can't be helped

353
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,340
They say that business is going to get increasingly difficult from now on

354
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:17,500
If you guys are so weak-willed, Shintaro will be unreliable just like he was

355
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,148
and I feel sorry for the administration

356
00:27:21,036 --> 00:27:25,202
If I die, this business will be finished.

357
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:33,050
Where's  Kei-chan?

358
00:27:33,293 --> 00:27:36,293
She's talking about something with your wife in the tatami room right now

359
00:27:39,718 --> 00:27:40,391
What's that?

360
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm really glad that I took you in

361
00:27:48,506 --> 00:27:52,174
The store is clean and the work gets done

362
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:55,793
I rely on you more than my real children

363
00:27:56,246 --> 00:27:57,374
No way.

364
00:27:58,086 --> 00:28:01,602
When I heard that we were born on the same day of the same month,

365
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:04,348
I felt like we were not strangers

366
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,540
Thank you very much.

367
00:28:06,036 --> 00:28:09,536
So I wanna talk with you.

368
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:10,442
Yes.

369
00:28:11,413 --> 00:28:13,815
Yes, you're in high spirits

370
00:28:13,910 --> 00:28:17,924
and  healthy and seems to like working in the store

371
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:22,580
I'd like to leave this business to you.

372
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,741
Sho-san.
Don't worry.

373
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,772
I'll have you listen with me

374
00:28:30,359 --> 00:28:31,176
Is that so...

375
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:40,118
It may be strange for me to say this about my own child,

376
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,712
but as a husband,he is not as embarrassing as anyone else's,

377
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:56,170
However, I feel like there is something lacking on him.

378
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:01,934
If you could help him as his wife,

379
00:29:03,512 --> 00:29:05,975
we would have two daughters

380
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,478
and many things would happen in the future

381
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:14,820
I think you will be able to steer the ship well as the eldest son's wife.

382
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,535
What do you think?

383
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:22,260
If that happens, I can retire with peace of mind,

384
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,578
but I don't know what would have happened to me without your help

385
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:37,099
I feel it's a shame
that you have to say that so much,

386
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,173
but will you accept it?

387
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,060
But ...Please

388
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,940
I'd like to think about it for a while

389
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,134
Is this something you need to think about?

390
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,547
Well, it's an important part of a woman's life.

391
00:29:59,606 --> 00:30:03,651
Well then, think about it

392
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,651
I have to heat up the bath

393
00:30:15,594 --> 00:30:16,461
Sis.

394
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:18,847
What's wrong?

395
00:30:19,557 --> 00:30:20,770
I'm going to Tianjin

396
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:25,771
Instead, I want to quit here.

397
00:30:26,693 --> 00:30:31,392
Now I understand why you guy are always alone.

398
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,782
It's all about Okei,right?

399
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:38,830
You  must be really hard for you if she become Shintaro's wife

400
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,933
What are you talking about?

401
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,460
I understand.

402
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,438
But this isn't for me to do

403
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,913
Our family tells me to do that.

404
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,620
Please understand that

405
00:31:04,288 --> 00:31:05,455
I'm home.

406
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,242
What happened just now?

407
00:31:14,044 --> 00:31:14,957
 You're crying

408
00:31:17,022 --> 00:31:18,913
I'll give this back to you

409
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:19,920
You are stupid.

410
00:31:20,093 --> 00:31:21,279
That was just a joke

411
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:25,347
But I don't need it anymore

412
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,233
What's wrong?

413
00:31:36,421 --> 00:31:37,061
Mom.

414
00:31:38,183 --> 00:31:41,700
Are you going to have Kei to marry Shintaro? Why?

415
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:43,982
Who did you ask?

416
00:31:44,059 --> 00:31:47,059
Anyone is fine, why?

417
00:31:48,805 --> 00:31:51,805
for the sake of the family.

418
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,365
Are you forcing him to marry?

419
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,857
It will also be good for Kei

420
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,626
Or Kei is saying that she does not like?

421
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:03,278
Mom, I like Kei

422
00:32:03,829 --> 00:32:04,930
Kei likes me

423
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:06,275
So?

424
00:32:06,561 --> 00:32:09,076
So when I graduate from college, I want to get married with her.

425
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:12,480
I won't allow that

426
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,440
Kei will become Shintaro's wife and inherit the family business

427
00:32:16,532 --> 00:32:17,072
Mom.

428
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:21,106
Kei is someone who is desperately needed in this house.

429
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:26,643
She is the one who must be there to protect the business that Father started

430
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:30,130
It doesn't matter if Tsutsumi's house collapses

431
00:32:30,155 --> 00:32:30,657
Eiji.

432
00:32:30,746 --> 00:32:37,632
Although he say it's a business In reality, he's making money by using military force
and politics to intimidate people into giving up cotton and soybean meal at low prices

433
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:41,040
We are getting fat by squeezing oil out of the Chinese

434
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,981
It would be better if one of these collapses were to go under

435
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:43,706
Eiji.

436
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,370
You want to humiliate your mother and your father?

437
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:52,609
Are you going to sacrifice Kei for some shameless business?

438
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:57,190
Are you going to decide Kei's life? I'm against it

439
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:02,080
Is that so? Do you really hate here that much?

440
00:33:02,407 --> 00:33:03,080
No.

441
00:33:03,686 --> 00:33:06,282
No, there's no choice. Get out of this house

442
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:07,868
Get out tomorrow

443
00:33:09,776 --> 00:33:13,875
You're not a child either. Try living on your own

444
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:17,212
Think about how difficult it is to live.

445
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:34,204
Kei.

446
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:39,223
I'm leaving from here.

447
00:33:39,371 --> 00:33:40,551
She said something?

448
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:44,921
If I told her I wanted to marry you

449
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:46,205
She was angry.

450
00:33:48,715 --> 00:33:53,660
Are you following me or stay here?

451
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,576
Let's get out of here early

452
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,360
I was wrong to forcefully lead you five years ago

453
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:06,390
Let's go out together and go to China.

454
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,980
Let's Join forces with the Chinese people and fight!

455
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,600
To defeat King and create a new country.

456
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:16,100
Your wife will allow that to happen

457
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:18,224
You don't have to worry about her.

458
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Son-kun will be returning soon. Let's go on the same boat

459
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,557
But that wasn't very ungrateful,

460
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,841
so you ended up working as a maid for five years

461
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,078
The repayment has already been made

462
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,987
Sorry, that's not all.

463
00:34:35,286 --> 00:34:39,041
At that time, her picked me up

464
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,980
I don't think you understand how grateful I
am for that.

465
00:34:45,036 --> 00:34:47,989
You know nothing of the poor life.

466
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:49,484
I know.

467
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:51,118
I don't think you understand.

468
00:34:51,181 --> 00:34:51,801
Kei.

469
00:34:54,698 --> 00:34:55,505
You hate me?

470
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:56,898
No.

471
00:34:57,397 --> 00:34:58,955
It's nothing like that

472
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:01,458
We'll be together

473
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,162
You are stupid.

474
00:35:04,813 --> 00:35:06,252
Or are you scared of China?

475
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:11,578
Don't worry.
China is more civilized than Japan.

476
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:13,996
It's better than here.

477
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,766
Well then, I'll meet Son-kun

478
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:18,791
and decide on a date

479
00:35:19,102 --> 00:35:20,064
Good night.

480
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:08,617
Ma'am.

481
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,550
What can I do for you?

482
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:14,467
What you just said..

483
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:17,492
If you're okay with someone like me,

484
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:24,310
would you be willing to marry Shintaro?

485
00:36:25,036 --> 00:36:25,583
Yes.

486
00:36:26,163 --> 00:36:27,029
Seriously?

487
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:29,180
Yes.

488
00:36:30,009 --> 00:36:33,009
You don't have to concern about Eiji anymore?

489
00:36:34,334 --> 00:36:34,987
No.

490
00:36:36,997 --> 00:36:38,243
Thanks.

491
00:36:38,903 --> 00:36:41,903
Now our house is safe

492
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,080
I'm sure my late father would be pleased

493
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,458
No, please take care of Shintaro for the rest of your life

494
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:53,607
You promise me?

495
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:54,941
Yes.

496
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:56,301
Are you sure?

497
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:57,957
Yes.

498
00:37:00,061 --> 00:37:02,487
 I'll let Shintaro know right away

499
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:07,905
No matter how happy he is, Shintaro loves you too

500
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,146
it was good

501
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,826
Good for me

502
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:34,778
Okei.

503
00:37:37,273 --> 00:37:41,187
What do you think?
I'm getting marry to Seizo.

504
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,653
He likes me over sis.

505
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:48,084
What do you think?

506
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,463
congratulations.

507
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:55,456
You made the choice based on your own feelings

508
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:57,240
Fumiko is happy.

509
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,085
Thanks.

510
00:38:49,286 --> 00:38:51,075
Recently, in the Republic of China,

511
00:38:52,017 --> 00:39:02,486
there has been a fierce protest against Haiti,
with many people claiming that Japan's policy is to colonize

512
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,186
Japanese products were burned in various places.

513
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:09,670
Anti-Japanese demonstrations, mainly by students, are thriving

514
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,596
If the situation continues as it is, trade between
Japan and China will come to a complete halt,

515
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,620
not only destroying the Japanese economy

516
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,246
but also putting the lives

517
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:25,022
and property of Japanese people in China in danger

518
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:29,831
This is the first time our country has been in a position like this since the Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars

519
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:35,418
The things he built as a hero are gone, and the sacrifices he made in the good war

520
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,010
I feel truly sorry for the tens of thousands of people who died in the war

521
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,019
Therefore, there is only one path for our country to take at this time

522
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:53,602
Whenever our rights are violated in China, we will take countermeasures.

523
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:57,615
In other words, they are taking a strong stance,

524
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,340
even going so far as to send in troops and go to war

525
00:40:27,037 --> 00:40:31,327
Chiyo-chan, were you in a place like this? You're quiet and alone

526
00:40:33,174 --> 00:40:35,206
Your mom is away every day and you are lonely.

527
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:39,144
She won't play with me.

528
00:40:39,169 --> 00:40:40,058
I hate my mother.

529
00:40:40,089 --> 00:40:42,089
Oh you hate her?

530
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,126
What's wrong, sister?

531
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:53,565
If you're going on a blind date, you should be by Inose's side

532
00:40:53,786 --> 00:40:57,628
Inose-san has started playing shogi with your husband

533
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,910
Inose-san, what happened to this?

534
00:41:03,074 --> 00:41:05,324
What happened to Fusako?

535
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:08,473
I think she will be here soon.

536
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,885
I hear the kid has issues and she's scared or

537
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:19,109
She is such a family woman.

538
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:22,636
She’s very interested in children's education

539
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:24,681
I see.

540
00:41:25,259 --> 00:41:29,458
He's troublesome.
What is your sister's feeling?

541
00:41:30,092 --> 00:41:34,667
Yes, he's a great politician,

542
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:38,359
but he's a little too old

543
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:40,494
But I don't think that person would be okay

544
00:41:40,575 --> 00:41:42,341
Well, come quickly

545
00:41:42,643 --> 00:41:45,643
I feel so nervous and anxious,

546
00:41:46,076 --> 00:41:47,961
I feel like my life is being shortened

547
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:51,142
This is not your first blind date.

548
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:54,966
If you find annoying,

549
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:56,598
please go home.

550
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:01,761
I didn't mean it.
Don't get me wrong.

551
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:06,764
Please say hello to Inose.

552
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,176
I'm in trouble

553
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Inose-san say he goes home now.

554
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:15,145
Please stop him.

555
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:19,167
Okei won't come back yet?

556
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,692
That's irresponsible

557
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:26,366
She made the arrangements herself.

558
00:42:26,391 --> 00:42:28,453
let's all go and talk to him

559
00:42:48,725 --> 00:42:51,395
here's an urgent telegram

560
00:42:51,575 --> 00:42:52,815
What did Tenjin's store say?

561
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,460
It seems that Chinese’s employees want to quit the store

562
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:59,533
Why? do they say the salary is low?

563
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,116
They say if someone works at a Japanese store, they're a traitor

564
00:43:04,902 --> 00:43:07,118
Apparently everyone was going to be arrested and beaten up

565
00:43:07,163 --> 00:43:08,712
That's just an excuse

566
00:43:08,997 --> 00:43:11,584
They really want more pay.

567
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:16,389
In this case, we'll have to rely on the military

568
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,031
Military?

569
00:43:18,649 --> 00:43:21,857
If things continue like this, we won't be able
to do business and our stores will go bankrupt

570
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,885
We need the military to protect us

571
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:27,149
But if we send troops into the city, it will lead to another war

572
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,095
There's no other way

573
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,979
Because that's the only way

574
00:43:32,996 --> 00:43:35,609
Okei, I hate war.

575
00:43:36,387 --> 00:43:38,431
There's a war going on with your father killed.

576
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:42,223
The war made you all alone.

577
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:43,929
and made my legs broken.

578
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:46,626
It's a business that was started even at such a cost

579
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,806
We have to protect it even in war

580
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,522
However, it is going for a bad that can't forcefully overcome Chinese.

581
00:43:53,110 --> 00:43:57,280
If Eiji hears this, he'll be furious.

582
00:43:58,246 --> 00:44:00,313
For better or worse, we are businessmen

583
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,476
Just say it and make a ton of money

584
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,273
That's good for the country and good for us.

585
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:09,877
Okei.

586
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,958
You're becoming a more and more scary person

587
00:44:21,633 --> 00:44:25,028
So, please them to increase their salary.

588
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,626
I'll just have to endure it for a while

589
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:31,270
Hello, is that you?

590
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:37,296
Inose has left?
What happened to Inose-san?

591
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,296
If that person were to marry Fusako,

592
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,016
it would be a great help to our business.

593
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:44,764
So please.

594
00:44:45,163 --> 00:44:47,889
I don't know about that kind of politics

595
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:49,846
If you recommended, then

596
00:44:49,871 --> 00:44:51,267
Why you won't come home early?

597
00:44:51,543 --> 00:44:54,543
You're busy at the store?

598
00:44:55,394 --> 00:44:58,859
but anyway, Seizo-kun, Fumi, and I all tried our best to keep him back.

599
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,206
But Inose-san has gone home

600
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,180
He said it's boring without you.

601
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,376
So in the end it's your fault

602
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,432
I'm sure oKei'll be angry.

603
00:45:10,744 --> 00:45:12,268
Because she wasn't there

604
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,889
Inose-san has gone home .

605
00:45:16,229 --> 00:45:18,652
I don't like being scolded by Kei either.

606
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,995
What's the hell?

607
00:45:22,104 --> 00:45:23,160
But sis.

608
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:26,185
I'm troublemaker in this house anyway.

609
00:45:27,255 --> 00:45:30,713
Okei want me to go away.

610
00:45:35,446 --> 00:45:38,165
You were also wrong about what happened today

611
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,286
The reason I did shogi was it was
because I wanted to please Inose-san

612
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,966
That's bad.

613
00:45:43,063 --> 00:45:46,063
she must have felt that she had been made fun of.

614
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:50,720
Would it have been better if I had danced to keep him?

615
00:45:52,763 --> 00:45:53,960
I'm off to home.

616
00:45:56,898 --> 00:45:58,258
He's an asshole.

617
00:46:00,128 --> 00:46:03,128
That guy is just lip service about being European and modern

618
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,600
My marriage was a failure

619
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:10,068
Why?

620
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:17,332
He said he would do housework after marriage but he never actually does anything.

621
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,860
Everyone say that Seizo-san is too good for you.

622
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,132
Give me a break.

623
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,126
If Okei hadn't told you

624
00:46:25,150 --> 00:46:26,978
That you were happy

625
00:46:27,003 --> 00:46:28,915
I never married that person

626
00:46:29,933 --> 00:46:31,401
I guess Okei led me on.

627
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,978
Is that so?

628
00:46:35,318 --> 00:46:36,632
I hate her now.

629
00:47:05,224 --> 00:47:06,724
I'm home.

630
00:47:14,036 --> 00:47:18,073
I'm sorry I couldn't make it in time for
Inose-san's return today

631
00:47:18,098 --> 00:47:22,360
There was a big fuss about whether we close the tenjin Shop or not

632
00:47:27,224 --> 00:47:29,076
so you're still angry.

633
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,680
I have no intention of forcing anything on Inose-san.

634
00:47:32,770 --> 00:47:34,068
It's okay to refuse

635
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,060
you

636
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:41,770
I can't stand you are silent like that

637
00:47:42,089 --> 00:47:45,239
I go to various places to negotiate for the families here.

638
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,906
I know you'll do your best for us

639
00:47:48,961 --> 00:47:49,732
Thank you,

640
00:47:51,418 --> 00:47:54,115
Don't say like that.

641
00:47:54,450 --> 00:47:55,450
I'm incompetent.

642
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:57,198
I'm no use.

643
00:47:57,410 --> 00:47:58,450
I know about myself.

644
00:47:59,130 --> 00:48:03,366
If you have something to say, please don't hide anything

645
00:48:03,391 --> 00:48:04,060
Nothing.

646
00:48:04,903 --> 00:48:06,390
please tell me.

647
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,419
I can't back down like this

648
00:48:09,779 --> 00:48:10,521
I tell you.

649
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,505
We don't get along

650
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:13,966
We don't get along?

651
00:48:14,052 --> 00:48:18,153
In fact, there is nothing you do that is flawless.

652
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,046
But women are just good at noticing things

653
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:22,685
It's not just about working hard

654
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,036
There's something that only women have,

655
00:48:24,076 --> 00:48:27,076
but you don't seem to have it

656
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:31,153
What is one thing that only women have?

657
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:35,200
If you don't know what it is, there's no point. It's a waste

658
00:48:39,514 --> 00:48:41,070
No, there's no way

659
00:48:41,095 --> 00:48:43,741
I don't want to be left with just that

660
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:48,416
My mother told me
to take good care of this house

661
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:50,726
I am working hard for that.

662
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,750
I just think about you guys.

663
00:48:54,467 --> 00:48:57,754
You decided to be boss here.

664
00:48:58,857 --> 00:49:03,286
and maybe that was more important
to you than becoming my wife

665
00:49:03,614 --> 00:49:05,638
What are you talking about?

666
00:49:07,708 --> 00:49:09,083
By the way

667
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,970
when you married me, you lied yourself?

668
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,607
What are you talking about?

669
00:49:18,177 --> 00:49:19,185
About Eiji.

670
00:49:20,006 --> 00:49:21,146
About Eiji?

671
00:49:21,607 --> 00:49:23,090
You liked Eiji

672
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:24,810
But you married me.

673
00:49:25,638 --> 00:49:26,388
It's impossible.

674
00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:30,677
Do you like me or not?

675
00:49:34,106 --> 00:49:34,950
You hate me.

676
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,326
Your husband is not me,but this house.

677
00:49:41,716 --> 00:49:42,855
for the past 10 years

678
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:45,880
You've never loved me like a husband

679
00:49:46,208 --> 00:49:47,458
What a shame.

680
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:49,841
why won't you break up with me?

681
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:51,857
Aren't you going to kick me out of here?

682
00:49:53,987 --> 00:49:58,068
Just like Eiji,I love you too

683
00:49:58,750 --> 00:50:01,380
You're a necessary person in this house

684
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,677
If anyone leaves, it's me

685
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,591
You.

686
00:50:16,828 --> 00:50:19,841
Human make a lot of mistakes

687
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:23,830
It's like doing something just to make a mistake

688
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,325
Once again, this is the path I chose

689
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,840
If I know it's a mistake, I'll try to make it not a mistake

690
00:50:43,443 --> 00:50:45,326
I'm home.

691
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,185
Please give me a souvenir

692
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:52,606
I'm currently busy

693
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:54,756
I was busy and forgot.

694
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,266
I'll take you to the zoo next time,

695
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:59,290
You're always lying.

696
00:50:59,451 --> 00:51:01,177
I hate you.

697
00:51:03,467 --> 00:51:06,467
I hate you.
Get out.

698
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:14,951
At last, I was hated by you too.

699
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:18,566
but I'm sure you'll understand me

700
00:51:18,590 --> 00:51:21,590
when you grow up a little more

701
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:23,334
Good night.

702
00:52:11,364 --> 00:52:13,565
2,000 tons of bean dregs from Goodnight Manchuria

703
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:15,349
the ship enters Shimonoseki port

704
00:52:15,724 --> 00:52:17,411
The fertilizer is not ready?

705
00:52:17,708 --> 00:52:20,708
It will be shipped early next month.

706
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:25,325
president, he is an excellent guy.

707
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:28,310
He'd be a perfect husband for your daughter

708
00:52:28,349 --> 00:52:31,966
He will hold a senior position in the Army in the future.

709
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,439
That's an exaggeration.

710
00:52:33,690 --> 00:52:36,690
He led the war against China

711
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:41,528
You're young.
I wonder what will happen about war.

712
00:52:42,146 --> 00:52:44,614
It seems that people in the U.S. are opposed to the memory of the war,

713
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:47,452
but that opposition from other countries won't have any lasting effects

714
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,935
In order for Japan to develop,

715
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,346
it must control China and Manchuria

716
00:52:51,650 --> 00:52:53,263
It's the lifeline of Japan

717
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:57,364
If this man becomes the president's husband , we will be worthful.

718
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:03,396
We're in charge of the war, and you  can make a lot of money in China.

719
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,880
I'll give you plenty of support

720
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:11,869
Hello, it's me.

721
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,591
Okei.

722
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:20,443
Excuse me

723
00:53:24,302 --> 00:53:25,099
, what happened?

724
00:53:27,188 --> 00:53:29,099
So Eiji came back suddenly.

725
00:53:31,521 --> 00:53:32,427
Eiji?

726
00:53:33,591 --> 00:53:35,295
I get it.

727
00:53:39,864 --> 00:53:42,380
I'm sorry to say this

728
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,736
Can we postpone tonight's meeting until tomorrow?

729
00:53:45,779 --> 00:53:46,818
Why?

730
00:53:47,404 --> 00:53:49,185
I suddenly had an urgent matter.

731
00:53:51,935 --> 00:53:53,055
so it can't be helped.

732
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:54,856
Thank you very much,

733
00:53:55,661 --> 00:53:57,880
but the seats are reserved for Akasaka,

734
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:00,686
so I wonder if you've invited some pretty girls.

735
00:54:00,711 --> 00:54:01,763
Yes.

736
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:04,600
That's a shame you wouldn't come.

737
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,840
I'll go for a cleanse of my soul after a long time

738
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,271
See you.

739
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:23,274
You're Chie-chan, Okei-san's child

740
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:26,474
It's like a dream.

741
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:28,295
 Where have you been?

742
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,005
In many places.

743
00:54:33,885 --> 00:54:39,286
in the Kanto region in Nanjing, Beijing, and Shanghai

744
00:54:39,849 --> 00:54:40,826
What were you doing

745
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,689
I've done a lot of different things like that.

746
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,724
You must have had a lot of trouble.

747
00:54:51,380 --> 00:54:53,247
Your dad is at company?

748
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:54,709
At school.

749
00:54:55,552 --> 00:54:56,240
At school?

750
00:54:56,692 --> 00:54:58,571
He's a Teachers at Yokohama International School

751
00:54:58,998 --> 00:55:00,365
He is a Chinese teacher.

752
00:55:01,909 --> 00:55:04,262
It must be hard to commute to Yokohama from Tokyo

753
00:55:04,944 --> 00:55:06,857
He lives in an apartment in Yokohama

754
00:55:08,115 --> 00:55:08,974
So.

755
00:55:09,898 --> 00:55:11,638
He is separated from my mother.

756
00:55:13,974 --> 00:55:14,748
Why?

757
00:55:15,365 --> 00:55:16,568
I have no idea.

758
00:55:17,310 --> 00:55:18,333
Ask my mom

759
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,021
Auntie Fusako and Auntie Fumie are fine?

760
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,247
I don't know

761
00:55:25,952 --> 00:55:28,708
My aunts and My mom don't get along well.

762
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,427
so neither of them come here very often

763
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:33,997
I see

764
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:37,115
you received a call from your mom.

765
00:55:37,492 --> 00:55:39,778
Apparently the matchmaking has been postponed until tomorrow

766
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Excuse me, I have piano lessons

767
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:57,520
Please come home with me today

768
00:55:57,662 --> 00:55:58,451
Why?

769
00:55:58,820 --> 00:56:01,820
Because Tsutsumi's house is your house

770
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,536
If you are going to separate, it is really me who should move out

771
00:56:05,575 --> 00:56:08,575
Enough already, it's the same old story over and over again

772
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,208
Besides, it's been a while since Eiji has returned home,

773
00:56:14,176 --> 00:56:16,213
so it would be embarrassing for you to be living apart

774
00:56:17,521 --> 00:56:19,810
Did you come here without being an Eiji?

775
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:21,802
Why?

776
00:56:22,459 --> 00:56:24,193
What do you mean?

777
00:56:25,206 --> 00:56:28,206
I'm sure you wanted to see Eiji.

778
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,341
Don't say about past again

779
00:56:30,366 --> 00:56:32,583
If I'm here I'll just get in the way?

780
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,107
, what do you mean?

781
00:56:35,497 --> 00:56:37,825
Sorry about that, but get it back now

782
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:40,732
I have some writing to finish tonight.

783
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:51,466
You don't have laundry?

784
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:55,185
Chie always come to here to do that.

785
00:56:55,349 --> 00:56:56,779
Chie always come?

786
00:56:57,544 --> 00:56:58,669
She comes over sometimes.

787
00:57:02,373 --> 00:57:04,193
She seems to like you.

788
00:57:04,998 --> 00:57:05,701
You think so?

789
00:57:06,215 --> 00:57:07,544
I guess she hates me

790
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,640
That Chie's marriage proposal I once spoke of

791
00:57:15,019 --> 00:57:17,515
The other party is very enthusiastic about it

792
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,425
You could meet him once?

793
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:22,450
No, if you think it's good, then you should decide after consulting with Chie.

794
00:57:23,479 --> 00:57:25,825
there's no need for me to step in

795
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:27,700
I hate soldiers.

796
00:57:38,701 --> 00:57:39,537
You.

797
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:47,724
Goodbye. Good night

798
00:58:16,216 --> 00:58:17,005
Are you Madam?

799
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:17,646
Yes.

800
00:58:17,912 --> 00:58:19,075
We're police.

801
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:20,528
Eiji Tsutsumi is probably be here.

802
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,372
If you hide it, it will be bad

803
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:27,802
There's something wrong with Eiji?

804
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,810
Japanese sake is good.

805
00:58:31,545 --> 00:58:34,545
It's been a while since I last drank Japanese sake with you like this

806
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:39,390
It's been 27 years.

807
00:58:39,526 --> 00:58:44,552
27 years or 27 years,china and Japan has changed too.

808
00:58:45,050 --> 00:58:46,989
Japan started a terrible war

809
00:58:48,157 --> 00:58:50,224
It would be a shame for a modern soldier to come here

810
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,320
They don't think about Chinese people at all.

811
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:57,255
We were different, demons of the Meiji era

812
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,141
We loved China and were willing to die for her

813
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:06,466
If we wage such a reckless war,

814
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:09,490
Japan's future will be ruined

815
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,415
The whole world is criticizing Japan

816
00:59:13,444 --> 00:59:15,876
Eiji, why did you come back?

817
00:59:17,236 --> 00:59:20,236
As I get older, I start to miss my hometown

818
00:59:20,478 --> 00:59:24,548
You must have come back to campaign against the war.

819
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:28,086
Don't hide it.

820
00:59:28,110 --> 00:59:29,868
I'm not that stupid again

821
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,829
I'd love to help you with your work too, but unfortunately

822
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:39,495
My body doesn't listen to me, and my legs hurt more and more every year

823
00:59:40,657 --> 00:59:42,520
Sometimes I can't walk

824
00:59:49,770 --> 00:59:51,907
Welcome back, Eiji-san

825
00:59:58,438 --> 00:59:59,188
Sis.

826
01:00:00,100 --> 01:00:00,993
It's been a while

827
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:04,493
Sorry, We had drink.
Come to join us.

828
01:00:05,423 --> 01:00:08,423
There was no alcohol.

829
01:00:12,439 --> 01:00:13,759
Bring us beers.

830
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,173
Yes, I'll bring it right away

831
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:16,704
I'll have it here.

832
01:00:17,056 --> 01:00:18,478
Here.

833
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:20,805
Don't disturb me.

834
01:00:21,021 --> 01:00:24,021
When I drink while looking at you,I can taste it well.

835
01:00:24,453 --> 01:00:26,547
You are good at joking.

836
01:00:27,009 --> 01:00:28,861
You have a guest?

837
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,735
maybe they're business partners.

838
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:32,837
I wonder who the customers are

839
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:40,634
Eiji-san, how long will you be staying here this time?

840
01:00:41,264 --> 01:00:44,264
I don't think I'll be there for long,

841
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:46,267
Eiji.

842
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:49,790
but what business did you have coming back to the mainland this time?

843
01:00:50,952 --> 01:00:54,579
There's no need to tell me anything new

844
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:57,009
Tell me.

845
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,548
Tell me all your actions

846
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:00,626
What?

847
01:01:02,026 --> 01:01:05,026
As the wife of the heir to Tsutsum house,

848
01:01:05,252 --> 01:01:08,844
I need to know about the lives of my husband's relatives

849
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:11,774
What were you doing over there?

850
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:14,345
What is your purpose in coming back this time?

851
01:01:17,476 --> 01:01:19,732
I don't like to give the same answer twice

852
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:24,282
Please tell me the truth. Can't you tell me the truth?

853
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,446
I don't see the need for that

854
01:01:29,707 --> 01:01:30,587
Is that so.

855
01:01:31,266 --> 01:01:37,246
It would be a problem if people found out what you did there and what your purpose is when you come back.

856
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:39,878
I'll leave it to your imagination

857
01:01:44,471 --> 01:01:47,471
I understand, there is no other way

858
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,984
Your customers are waiting

859
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,316
He's waiting in the Western-style room.

860
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:01,645
Okei.

861
01:02:03,026 --> 01:02:04,214
You meant to say?

862
01:02:06,312 --> 01:02:10,199
I came here thinking I would have to give another reply.

863
01:02:11,305 --> 01:02:15,566
After hearing what you just said, I think my answer was correct

864
01:02:16,636 --> 01:02:17,652
You're such a fool.

865
01:02:20,512 --> 01:02:22,473
You're changed.

866
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:26,199
You sold me.

867
01:02:30,801 --> 01:02:34,191
He's waiting in the Western-style room?

868
01:02:48,642 --> 01:02:50,082
You came out and I was surprised.

869
01:02:51,754 --> 01:02:53,574
If I don't come here, this family will be in trouble.

870
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:55,906
That's right

871
01:02:55,965 --> 01:02:56,895
Why catch me?

872
01:02:57,422 --> 01:02:59,214
You are a communist?

873
01:03:00,129 --> 01:03:01,293
You are violating the Peace Preservation Act.

874
01:03:01,948 --> 01:03:06,058
You are sentenced to life imprisonment or death.

875
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,980
You came back to Japan to die.

876
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,480
I want to leave through the garden,I don't want to stand out

877
01:03:13,965 --> 01:03:14,699
What should we do?

878
01:03:15,964 --> 01:03:16,839
Well...

879
01:03:18,145 --> 01:03:19,807
I won't run away or hide.

880
01:03:41,113 --> 01:03:41,871
Eiji.

881
01:03:45,187 --> 01:03:45,815
Uncle.

882
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:49,840
I'm off now.

883
01:03:50,641 --> 01:03:55,230
Please understand my feelings too

884
01:04:00,382 --> 01:04:04,238
Don't worry, I understand

885
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,082
But Okei

886
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:11,870
It's no good being tied down like this forever

887
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:14,792
You're becoming less and less human.

888
01:04:16,035 --> 01:04:16,730
Eiji.

889
01:04:16,775 --> 01:04:17,910
Don't abandon yourself

890
01:04:19,463 --> 01:04:23,402
Humans must live their lives without regrets

891
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:35,826
Good day.

892
01:04:45,145 --> 01:04:49,777
uncle, say hello to everyone.

893
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:02,307
Ah.

894
01:05:03,828 --> 01:05:04,523
Okei.

895
01:05:05,926 --> 01:05:12,132
At that time you came from here,I'm leaving from here.

896
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:14,633
From same spot.

897
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,796
Uncle

898
01:06:09,867 --> 01:06:11,343
Eiji!

899
01:06:19,883 --> 01:06:20,570
Mom.

900
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:23,749
Where was he taken?

901
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:26,491
Did you meet him?

902
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,601
What did he do?

903
01:06:31,368 --> 01:06:32,710
I have no idea.

904
01:06:33,691 --> 01:06:38,320
Did you kick him out without knowing?

905
01:06:39,904 --> 01:06:40,546
Right?

906
01:06:42,679 --> 01:06:43,882
It was your mother who did it

907
01:06:46,738 --> 01:06:50,960
After all, he's Dad's real brother.

908
01:06:53,282 --> 01:06:54,913
So you don't think anything of it?

909
01:06:56,255 --> 01:07:00,421
No matter how painful it may be,

910
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,444
there are things in this world that must be done.

911
01:07:05,023 --> 01:07:07,437
I don't understand about your feeling.

912
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,984
Chie.

913
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:19,757
Your meeting has been postponed until tomorrow.

914
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:22,707
Please go to the hairdresser in the morning

915
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,425
Of course you'll wear a kimono

916
01:07:26,390 --> 01:07:27,183
Mother

917
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:32,964
If I married that soldier, would that help the store?

918
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,886
What are you saying?

919
01:07:35,349 --> 01:07:36,996
I only think about you

920
01:07:37,021 --> 01:07:37,668
I don't think so.

921
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:41,957
I heard it from  Auntie Fusako and Fumi.

922
01:07:43,338 --> 01:07:47,246
There's a hidden agenda behind everything Mom says

923
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:48,965
Chie.

924
01:07:50,931 --> 01:07:52,753
Mom is such a cold person

925
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:56,948
What a nasty woman, you're not human.

926
01:08:03,590 --> 01:08:06,590
We're not family anymore

927
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:08,777
Get out

928
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:37,762
where are you going?

929
01:08:37,787 --> 01:08:39,855
Yokohama I'm going to live with my dad now

930
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,691
Hold on.

931
01:08:45,051 --> 01:08:45,957
Chie.

932
01:08:58,738 --> 01:09:00,012
Okei.

933
01:09:05,818 --> 01:09:08,449
What are you doing?

934
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:14,933
I definitely let madam know if something happens

935
01:09:15,690 --> 01:09:19,557
Eiji had a close relationship with a Chinese person.

936
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:22,652
That's illegal all in Japan

937
01:09:23,348 --> 01:09:25,035
 I can't understand

938
01:09:26,410 --> 01:09:30,816
I don't think what I did was wrong

939
01:09:32,111 --> 01:09:35,111
That was the only way to protect this family.

940
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:41,433
But everyone would leave me.

941
01:09:43,230 --> 01:09:45,113
You too will soon be

942
01:09:45,138 --> 01:09:46,246
No joke.

943
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,070
I will not leave your side.

944
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:57,332
But I'm starting to hate myself more and more.

945
01:09:57,488 --> 01:09:59,941
 It's not your fault

946
01:10:01,230 --> 01:10:03,996
I made you my wife

947
01:10:04,020 --> 01:10:06,050
This Shizu-san is at fault

948
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,680
I want to protect this house as a single woman

949
01:10:10,310 --> 01:10:13,310
No matter how gentle a woman is, she becomes more and more strict

950
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,363
It's not your fault, Okei.

951
01:10:17,957 --> 01:10:20,012
Stay strong.

952
01:11:23,129 --> 01:11:24,371
Showa19

953
01:11:26,574 --> 01:11:28,230
I'm fine with going to war

954
01:11:28,934 --> 01:11:32,464
But when I think about chie and others

955
01:11:33,912 --> 01:11:35,667
I worry and can't sleep at night

956
01:11:37,702 --> 01:11:40,702
I'm going to work at military factory

957
01:11:40,868 --> 01:11:42,863
You can't support a child on that salary

958
01:11:43,051 --> 01:11:44,160
It'll work out somehow

959
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:47,811
I want to say I'll leave it to me

960
01:11:47,991 --> 01:11:52,768
I haven't had a steady income since I retired from school

961
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:57,792
Piano teachers are like garbage in this day and age.

962
01:11:58,700 --> 01:11:59,986
I don't even have 100 yen saved up

963
01:12:02,126 --> 01:12:04,542
But I don't have any relatives in the countryside,

964
01:12:04,816 --> 01:12:07,793
so I have no choice but to ask Kei.

965
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,223
I don't want to ask my mother for a favor.

966
01:12:11,980 --> 01:12:14,496
Why don't you just leave your child with your mother

967
01:12:15,433 --> 01:12:16,316
I don't want.

968
01:12:17,060 --> 01:12:20,060
I haven't even notified her about the marriage since I left home

969
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:22,128
But Mom will be happy

970
01:12:23,011 --> 01:12:25,253
Living alone is lonely.

971
01:12:27,066 --> 01:12:28,426
But I don't like it.

972
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,238
Who're you?

973
01:12:54,231 --> 01:12:57,761
Did you come in without telling me?

974
01:13:00,466 --> 01:13:02,942
I'm the owner here

975
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:03,925
What?

976
01:13:19,301 --> 01:13:20,129
You.

977
01:13:20,738 --> 01:13:22,129
May I come in?

978
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:24,566
What's wrong?

979
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:28,582
I'm really sorry for coming in

980
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,464
What's wrong?

981
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:34,964
She mistook me for a thief

982
01:13:42,780 --> 01:13:46,597
You want me to take care of Chie's child, don't you?

983
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:54,621
I don't have any right to consult you now,

984
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:58,386
Don't worry.

985
01:13:58,632 --> 01:14:00,863
That Tsutsumi house is your house

986
01:14:01,657 --> 01:14:03,985
Whatever you want to do,

987
01:14:04,324 --> 01:14:06,868
I have never been against it

988
01:14:08,974 --> 01:14:11,282
That's true, but...

989
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:15,584
That's fine.

990
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:18,556
If you are happy with your child and chie

991
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:21,580
please come and move here with us

992
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,962
I see. Thank you.

993
01:14:29,204 --> 01:14:31,845
What happened?

994
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,305
My heart has been feeling a bit strange lately

995
01:14:42,873 --> 01:14:50,938
When Chie and others return, will you return with them?

996
01:14:52,415 --> 01:14:53,025
To here?

997
01:14:53,394 --> 01:14:59,329
Your room has been left as it was when you left.

998
01:15:00,884 --> 01:15:02,165
I see.

999
01:15:02,861 --> 01:15:05,430
Because you quit school

1000
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,628
You don't need to come to Yokohama anymore

1001
01:15:11,030 --> 01:15:12,581
That's true...

1002
01:15:13,574 --> 01:15:16,246
but if you only eat pitches,

1003
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:19,570
you'll end up becoming a bit of a mess

1004
01:15:20,780 --> 01:15:24,525
Here you can find plenty of meat, sugar, and eggs

1005
01:15:25,807 --> 01:15:27,503
This coffee is real too

1006
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,660
How do you get them?

1007
01:15:32,009 --> 01:15:35,009
I got them from the Army.

1008
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:39,040
Will there be soldiers coming in and out of there?

1009
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,948
We can only rely on soldiers for our business.

1010
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:49,182
Please come and stay here.

1011
01:15:49,930 --> 01:15:51,856
You are already old

1012
01:15:51,880 --> 01:15:53,355
It's hard to do it alone

1013
01:15:54,290 --> 01:15:55,831
I'm worried that you might get sick.

1014
01:15:57,642 --> 01:16:03,761
If something were to happen, I wouldn't be able to face mother.

1015
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:05,660
Mother?

1016
01:16:08,758 --> 01:16:11,308
I promised her.

1017
01:16:11,478 --> 01:16:12,769
I feel sorry.

1018
01:16:13,956 --> 01:16:17,246
And it's embarrassing to the world

1019
01:16:17,401 --> 01:16:19,448
It's embarrassing for the boss of the Tsutsumi family to live in an apartment.

1020
01:16:19,527 --> 01:16:20,152
Kei.

1021
01:16:21,176 --> 01:16:22,652
I won't come back here.

1022
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:30,449
Why? Please wait
Did I bother you?

1023
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,666
I don't care if I starve to death

1024
01:16:33,691 --> 01:16:35,433
I'll never come to this place again

1025
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,896
Please, please come back

1026
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:42,036
I don't want to

1027
01:16:42,060 --> 01:16:44,808
Why? Why?

1028
01:16:45,363 --> 01:16:47,558
I knew what you thought

1029
01:16:48,043 --> 01:16:48,960
How did you know?

1030
01:16:49,941 --> 01:16:52,917
You don't really care what happens to me.

1031
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,957
But when it comes to being obligated to mother, appearances are important to the world

1032
01:16:55,982 --> 01:16:57,199
You.

1033
01:16:57,730 --> 01:17:01,308
You're a fine woman who is perfect in whatever you do.

1034
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,613
You.

1035
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:15,605
What happened to you

1036
01:17:17,745 --> 01:17:18,816
Nothing

1037
01:17:19,504 --> 01:17:20,676
I'm fine.

1038
01:17:23,214 --> 01:17:26,777
You seem to be in a lot of pain

1039
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:31,722
It's fine, it's fine

1040
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:33,652
Call Mitsu.

1041
01:17:35,130 --> 01:17:36,886
Please leave it like this for a bit

1042
01:17:36,911 --> 01:17:38,021
I'll call doctor.

1043
01:17:40,484 --> 01:17:41,441
it's fine

1044
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:44,707
you can leave it like this

1045
01:17:45,508 --> 01:17:48,508
You and I.

1046
01:17:51,691 --> 01:17:54,949
I love you.

1047
01:17:57,834 --> 01:18:03,285
But you're too great for me.

1048
01:18:07,133 --> 01:18:10,133
You have to be strong and stay strong

1049
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:17,511
Don't say anything, just stay still

1050
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:23,230
Just you and me.

1051
01:18:27,934 --> 01:18:30,621
You!

1052
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:53,730
Again.

1053
01:18:54,540 --> 01:18:57,136
It's been a while since I've had such delicious sake.

1054
01:18:57,161 --> 01:18:58,176
Yeah.

1055
01:18:58,505 --> 01:19:01,505
It's rare to find such a delicious treat now.

1056
01:19:02,163 --> 01:19:05,163
What a great kei.

1057
01:19:07,464 --> 01:19:12,660
Please do your best for us old people for the country.

1058
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:17,380
Sister, Brother Shintaro

1059
01:19:17,700 --> 01:19:20,700
The doctor said he died of a heart attack

1060
01:19:21,542 --> 01:19:27,644
Apparently, he had been living alone for a long time and his body had become very weak

1061
01:19:28,233 --> 01:19:32,324
I wonder why okei should have taken better care of him.

1062
01:19:32,988 --> 01:19:34,223
She's so cold.

1063
01:19:35,223 --> 01:19:36,557
even before he die

1064
01:19:36,582 --> 01:19:38,348
Apparently he had a fight with her

1065
01:19:38,514 --> 01:19:41,519
and that caused him to have a heart attack

1066
01:19:41,544 --> 01:19:44,011
It's like she killed him.

1067
01:19:44,176 --> 01:19:45,434
Yeah.

1068
01:19:46,152 --> 01:19:48,339
It's her fault.

1069
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:51,574
Please don't speak ill of my mother.

1070
01:19:52,978 --> 01:19:55,019
It can't be helped. that's true

1071
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:59,525
The aunties were always saying bad things about my mother

1072
01:20:00,269 --> 01:20:01,895
Not only did you receive money for your wedding preparations,

1073
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,116
but you also received living expenses every month from her.

1074
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,196
but We didn't get it from Okei.

1075
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:08,766
We got it from the family fortune.

1076
01:20:08,791 --> 01:20:10,353
our mother increased that fortune.

1077
01:20:10,445 --> 01:20:11,512
That's not true.

1078
01:20:11,730 --> 01:20:13,806
The company grew thanks to my mother

1079
01:20:13,830 --> 01:20:16,830
Whoever did it,Tsutsumi has developed.

1080
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:21,177
Our fathers laid a strong foundation for us

1081
01:20:22,490 --> 01:20:24,121
You're ungrateful

1082
01:20:24,146 --> 01:20:25,185
What?

1083
01:20:26,396 --> 01:20:30,896
I hated my mother too, but I learned

1084
01:20:31,781 --> 01:20:33,216
Who made my mother like that?

1085
01:20:34,532 --> 01:20:35,701
We made her like that.

1086
01:20:36,347 --> 01:20:39,347
We were sloppy.

1087
01:20:39,836 --> 01:20:44,112
We were timid.We pushed everything onto our mother.

1088
01:20:44,370 --> 01:20:45,684
and acted cool

1089
01:20:47,105 --> 01:20:48,702
What about you guys?

1090
01:20:50,291 --> 01:20:52,458
You look similar with Okei.

1091
01:20:53,452 --> 01:20:54,272
What do you mean?

1092
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,970
That's not good for a poor person

1093
01:20:57,742 --> 01:20:59,217
Please say it again

1094
01:20:59,608 --> 01:21:01,004
Auntie, say it again

1095
01:21:01,211 --> 01:21:02,565
Stop it....

1096
01:21:03,267 --> 01:21:06,195
aunts say our mom killed our father.

1097
01:21:07,122 --> 01:21:07,802
That's true.

1098
01:21:08,353 --> 01:21:09,068
Why?

1099
01:21:13,610 --> 01:21:16,610
I definitely killed him

1100
01:21:17,870 --> 01:21:22,734
I don't know how to apologize, I was a bad wife

1101
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:25,443
I'm sorry,

1102
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:29,334
mother, why are you apologizing?

1103
01:21:30,430 --> 01:21:32,870
Mom is a great person, there's no need to apologize

1104
01:21:33,384 --> 01:21:34,084
Shut up!

1105
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:38,995
you're still our mom

1106
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:41,294
I don't like you. Please leave your seat

1107
01:21:42,134 --> 01:21:44,381
Please leave your seat

1108
01:21:47,150 --> 01:21:50,150
I hate seeing these people's faces

1109
01:21:51,236 --> 01:21:53,324
Let's go home

1110
01:22:03,235 --> 01:22:04,952
What's going on?

1111
01:22:17,157 --> 01:22:19,337
This is a telegram that just arrived at the office.

1112
01:22:23,073 --> 01:22:26,193
We are screwed up.
This is 4th time.

1113
01:22:28,182 --> 01:22:29,089
what happened?

1114
01:22:30,139 --> 01:22:35,428
Our 4 ships were sunk by an American submarine today

1115
01:22:37,790 --> 01:22:41,379
That is a huge loss

1116
01:22:42,410 --> 01:22:45,724
Maybe we'll have to close the store

1117
01:22:46,316 --> 01:22:48,861
But there's still some merchandise left in the warehouse in Fukagawa

1118
01:22:49,420 --> 01:22:51,202
They were all sold out a long time ago.

1119
01:22:52,035 --> 01:22:55,361
so this volume was our last hope

1120
01:22:55,930 --> 01:22:57,266
Closing the store?

1121
01:22:57,309 --> 01:22:59,197
What will happen to the company's assets?

1122
01:22:59,438 --> 01:23:00,251
We will sort them out

1123
01:23:00,553 --> 01:23:02,648
I think our stocks will come back

1124
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:05,209
We won't know until we produce it

1125
01:23:05,512 --> 01:23:08,512
I think I can afford the monthly living expenses

1126
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:11,972
We can't give it to you.

1127
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:15,853
Would you please leave?

1128
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:18,990
We need to think of a plan quickly

1129
01:23:23,540 --> 01:23:27,965
We should have stopped dangerous trade sooner and switched to the military industry,

1130
01:23:28,269 --> 01:23:31,140
No matter how much she's good, she's still a woman.

1131
01:23:31,489 --> 01:23:33,885
She can't think that far.

1132
01:23:33,992 --> 01:23:37,712
She's crazy.
She's been in the cotton trade all her life.

1133
01:23:38,270 --> 01:23:41,757
That's the way business was done in the Meiji era.

1134
01:23:45,092 --> 01:23:50,409
Even if we sell the office and warehouse, after
paying off the bank debt and retirement benefits,

1135
01:23:50,942 --> 01:23:52,739
this house is just left.

1136
01:23:54,809 --> 01:23:59,156
If it was destroyed in the war, we can't get insurance money.

1137
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:03,832
It's a shame to close Tsutsumi corp.

1138
01:24:05,713 --> 01:24:10,320
I couldn't keep any of the promises I made to my mother

1139
01:24:12,736 --> 01:24:15,222
What can I say to apologize?

1140
01:24:15,269 --> 01:24:15,903
It's okay

1141
01:24:16,813 --> 01:24:19,689
It's a company built on war anyway

1142
01:24:19,716 --> 01:24:21,783
It can't be helped.

1143
01:24:47,226 --> 01:24:53,584
The Kanto region was destroyed by the war

1144
01:24:54,249 --> 01:24:59,632
Warning An air raid warning has been issued for the Kanto region by the Eastern Military District Headquarters

1145
01:25:02,811 --> 01:25:05,334
I don't know if they'll come to Tokyo

1146
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:07,231
We're in danger in many ways.

1147
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:10,353
I plan to evacuate Chie and the others to Shinshu.

1148
01:25:10,956 --> 01:25:13,956
I have old business partners there.

1149
01:25:14,578 --> 01:25:16,393
I think it would be better if it was done as soon as possible

1150
01:25:16,589 --> 01:25:18,175
Will you come with us?

1151
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:21,446
No, I'll stay here.

1152
01:25:21,571 --> 01:25:24,571
But you can't walk well.

1153
01:25:24,938 --> 01:25:27,938
I don't mind dying if I'm too late to escape in an emergency

1154
01:25:28,369 --> 01:25:29,964
Don't say that

1155
01:25:30,386 --> 01:25:36,589
I don't want to leave your side.

1156
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,276
I want to be with you until I die

1157
01:27:48,715 --> 01:27:49,375
Okei.

1158
01:27:54,277 --> 01:27:55,510
You're Okei.

1159
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:02,362
Eiji..Why you are here?

1160
01:28:06,221 --> 01:28:07,722
I'm not a ghost.

1161
01:28:08,843 --> 01:28:13,332
I was released from prison five days ago
thanks to the US military

1162
01:28:15,189 --> 01:28:15,862
Eiji.

1163
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:19,538
How can I apologize?

1164
01:28:20,071 --> 01:28:21,449
I was betraying you

1165
01:28:27,328 --> 01:28:31,730
I wouldn't come here if I bear a grudge.

1166
01:28:35,369 --> 01:28:36,984
Do you live alone?

1167
01:28:38,273 --> 01:28:38,966
How about others?

1168
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,760
Everyone else is safe

1169
01:28:41,138 --> 01:28:47,006
They were all evacuated, so it was unfortunate that Shosuke  missed to escape

1170
01:28:52,771 --> 01:28:53,791
I’m sorry.

1171
01:28:55,170 --> 01:28:56,283
He was a good person,

1172
01:28:57,627 --> 01:28:59,714
All because of the war.

1173
01:29:01,242 --> 01:29:05,184
The house and the warehouse were completely burned down

1174
01:29:06,730 --> 01:29:11,792
I have nothing left of what I inherited from my mother

1175
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:13,825
They're all gone

1176
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:16,961
It's ok.

1177
01:29:18,316 --> 01:29:25,535
You have suffered your whole life because you
were tied up in tsutsumi house. Now you are free

1178
01:29:26,316 --> 01:29:32,092
Live for yourself, not for your country,
your family or your company

1179
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:38,550
What has my whole life been like?

1180
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:40,977
Was it all for nothing?

1181
01:29:41,996 --> 01:29:42,663
Okei.

1182
01:29:46,223 --> 01:29:49,556
I came to pick you up.

1183
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:55,084
I'm the one who brought you to this house and made you unhappy.

1184
01:29:56,390 --> 01:30:00,822
To make up for that, I'll take you out of here and make you happy

1185
01:30:02,786 --> 01:30:04,885
Let's get out.

1186
01:30:12,923 --> 01:30:13,890
Where are you going from here?

1187
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:17,400
When We lose the war, I have more friends

1188
01:30:17,857 --> 01:30:20,285
Now I am wellknown.

1189
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:29,458
So, Okei, do you still love me?

1190
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:35,080
Okay then let's go

1191
01:30:53,215 --> 01:30:56,215
I'm going to stay here after all

1192
01:30:57,890 --> 01:30:58,316
Why?

1193
01:30:59,399 --> 01:31:03,663
Chie and grandchildren come back in the spring.

1194
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:07,310
I need to build something easy by then

1195
01:31:07,990 --> 01:31:10,990
Even an old woman like me can be of some use

1196
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,266
I can take care for my grandchildren

1197
01:31:13,290 --> 01:31:16,618
OKei-san will always be OKei-san

1198
01:31:17,872 --> 01:31:19,928
You only think about other people.

1199
01:31:19,960 --> 01:31:21,966
I'm sure I'm an idiot

1200
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:30,401
Well, if you ever want to come to me,

1201
01:31:31,148 --> 01:31:32,079
you're welcome

1202
01:31:32,254 --> 01:31:35,842
Yes, my whole life....

1203
01:31:37,170 --> 01:31:40,170
This was decided 40 years ago when I went through the gate.

1204
01:31:43,542 --> 01:31:44,409
OKei.

1205
01:31:47,821 --> 01:31:50,086
Well then, take care

1206
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:52,962
See you.

1207
01:31:53,678 --> 01:31:54,531
See you.

1208
01:33:18,039 --> 01:33:27,146
THE END.

00:00:18,047 --> 00:00:27,492
When Japan's defeat in the Pacific War was imminent, Kisaburo Omiya
and I were ordered by the Kwantung Army to be transferred to the South.

3
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:31,070
We tried to get out of the army.

4
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,625
This was the game of our lives.

5
00:00:53,445 --> 00:00:54,453
Stay down!

6
00:00:55,844 --> 00:00:56,617
Get out!

7
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:30,898
soldier gangster

8
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:53,828
What happened?

9
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:59,359
I thought everything was going to be okay.

10
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,219
Damn it.
We are unlucky

11
00:03:20,508 --> 00:03:21,773
Did you awake?

12
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,609
Where is here?

13
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:34,914
This is the main army hospital.

14
00:03:36,711 --> 00:03:39,789
Omiya

15
00:03:40,883 --> 00:03:42,469
Ouch!

16
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:43,406
Don't move yet

17
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,008
You may have bruised your lower back and have back pain.

18
00:03:50,008 --> 00:03:54,500
Omiya, You should give up to seduce girls

19
00:03:54,672 --> 00:03:58,156
You should stop that.

20
00:03:59,633 --> 00:04:00,484
Really?

21
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:06,055
I'm better than you.
I just hit my head and chest

22
00:04:07,109 --> 00:04:08,508
Other is fine

23
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,461
You'll do an x-ray later.

24
00:04:18,219 --> 00:04:19,188
Mr.

25
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,750
That nurse is nice

26
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,211
Her name is Kyoko Ogata

27
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,328
She is 22 years old

28
00:04:30,914 --> 00:04:31,820
You know about her a lot

29
00:04:32,688 --> 00:04:33,820
Would you rather be with your wife?

30
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,242
She is much nicer

31
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,672
But I still love my wife

32
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:48,328
Mr.

33
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:55,313
My cock is still active

34
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:56,766
I see

35
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,555


36
00:05:08,422 --> 00:05:12,383
X-rays showed that Ms. Omiya's back pain was fine.

37
00:05:13,094 --> 00:05:14,906
We got better soon

38
00:05:16,195 --> 00:05:21,039
But later,What we feared has come to pass.

39
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:26,008
Omiya!

40
00:05:30,953 --> 00:05:36,438
Arita,Omiya,
We're going to question you.

41
00:05:43,016 --> 00:05:46,797
You were on that train that blew up.?

42
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:47,914
Yes

43
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:55,648
You were transferred from the 123rd, and you were on a different
train.

44
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:57,164
That's right

45
00:05:57,734 --> 00:05:59,383
Why you guys were on that train?

46
00:05:59,711 --> 00:06:04,047
He and I were on the train as guards.

47
00:06:05,328 --> 00:06:08,672
Who cut off the train?

48
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:09,945
I don't know

49
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,203
Why you don't know?

50
00:06:12,953 --> 00:06:15,703
I'm sure you know because you were on the train as
guards.

51
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:18,352
I was concentrating on the front

52
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:21,703
How about you?

53
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,516
Same with him

54
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,938
Did you never look back?

55
00:06:27,032 --> 00:06:28,938
When I looked back, there was no problem

56
00:06:29,383 --> 00:06:30,055
Right?

57
00:06:32,274 --> 00:06:33,266
When did the train cut off

58
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:35,828
Stupid!
I'm asking you

59
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:41,789
In fact he hit his head and went crazy

60
00:06:44,383 --> 00:06:46,071
Take a rest,Omiya

61
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:52,516
However, the train was separated, so the our team were saved.

62
00:06:54,157 --> 00:06:54,953
I think that was fine

63
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:56,352
It's bad!

64
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,008
In any case, we don't know

65
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,430
This is a mysterious case

66
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:09,969
Did you tell anyone about this incident?

67
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:12,227
No

68
00:07:14,813 --> 00:07:15,532
This case

69
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:23,125
It must be the work of the enemy to obstruct the movement of southern troops.

70
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:28,344
This is a military secret so make it absolutely secret

71
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:31,289
Don't talk to anyone.
You understand!

72
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:32,828
Yes

73
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:37,719
Ouch

74
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:38,618
Does it hurt?

75
00:07:39,618 --> 00:07:40,883
It still hurts a little

76
00:07:41,758 --> 00:07:44,750
It's strange. I think the bruise has already healed

77
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,547
I'll give you a massage later

78
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:49,196
Yes please

79
00:07:58,141 --> 00:08:01,493
Omiya, good news.
We will return to the mainland

80
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,563
We can go back to the original squad

81
00:08:07,844 --> 00:08:11,891
Omiya, you are not glad?

82
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,461
I want to be here

83
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,914
I and Omiya were told to get packed stuff this evening

84
00:08:28,532 --> 00:08:29,821
We can go back to the original squad

85
00:08:30,485 --> 00:08:31,883
We will return to the mainland

86
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:35,102
And we break up with this army

87
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:38,453
This is so good news to us

88
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,344
Salute!

89
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,000
Arita,Omiya

90
00:08:49,774 --> 00:08:50,532
Give orders to you

91
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:51,383
Sure

92
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:53,868
Give orders to you

93
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:59,813
Corporal Arita and Private First Class Omiya.

94
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:02,383
On April 15th

95
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,688
Order you to transfer to the 422 unit

96
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,789
It's different from what I heard

97
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:15,758
We were told we could return to the mainland.

98
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:17,586
Our convenience has changed

99
00:09:20,344 --> 00:09:23,477
Other troops have moved south, leaving only you

100
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,868
You were supposed to go to mainland

101
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:28,883
But it's good to go to move south

102
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:31,141
We're leaving tonight

103
00:09:32,148 --> 00:09:32,718
OK?

104
00:09:33,711 --> 00:09:34,391
Salute!

105
00:09:44,922 --> 00:09:45,657
Omiya

106
00:09:47,321 --> 00:09:50,735
We have ties to the military.

107
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,641
Damn it!

108
00:09:59,868 --> 00:10:00,828
Omiya-san

109
00:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,125
Thank you for all the help you have given me

110
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:07,649
You are likely to be assigned to the 422 unit

111
00:10:09,782 --> 00:10:10,969
I'm not lucky

112
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:12,141
Why?

113
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:13,266
The numbers are bad(422)

114
00:10:13,618 --> 00:10:18,289
Oh,The 422 unit also has my brother

115
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:19,297
Really?

116
00:10:19,422 --> 00:10:23,352
My brother's name is Ogata Shiro.
He belongs to Takujima team

117
00:10:24,477 --> 00:10:28,352
Tell him I'm fine if you met him

118
00:10:29,243 --> 00:10:32,203
I will meet your brother and be sure to tell it

119
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:36,782
Thank you for your kindness

120
00:10:37,844 --> 00:10:38,743
I thank you.

121
00:10:39,836 --> 00:10:42,633
Don't be so humble.
It's not so you

122
00:10:45,008 --> 00:10:46,047
I have a favor of you

123
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:47,250
What?

124
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,078
I have something I want to commemorate

125
00:10:50,914 --> 00:10:51,601
Tell me

126
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:52,750
Your...

127
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:56,140
I want

128
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:58,844
I want your hair

129
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:00,047
Please

130
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,516
Oh my hair?

131
00:11:04,243 --> 00:11:07,594
Not hair..another hair

132
00:11:08,063 --> 00:11:08,594
Eh?

133
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,313
I may die

134
00:11:17,828 --> 00:11:21,008
I may not be able to meet you anymore

135
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:23,094
So I want it

136
00:11:25,977 --> 00:11:26,539
I am

137
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:30,743
I close my eye

138
00:11:32,485 --> 00:11:33,313
Please

139
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,703
I want to make it my amulet

140
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:41,789
Please

141
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:57,657
She won't

142
00:12:11,407 --> 00:12:12,407
Please

143
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:33,868
The next day I and Mr. Omiya headed for a new mission

144
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:37,203
We are leaving the hospital

145
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:38,633
420 units are about 1 km west

146
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,383
It's in a small village

147
00:13:41,907 --> 00:13:42,696
I tell you

148
00:13:43,446 --> 00:13:49,875
We will be assigned to this unit on April 15th

149
00:13:50,524 --> 00:13:52,438
We'll work hard

150
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:53,868
OK

151
00:13:56,774 --> 00:13:58,118
You guys were in the Kwantung Army

152
00:13:58,805 --> 00:13:59,391
Yes

153
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:03,985
The Kwantung Army is great, but you have no practical experience yet

154
00:14:05,102 --> 00:14:07,899
We have a lot of practical experience

155
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,485
People who have no experience in combat are not real soldiers

156
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:16,610
Be well trained and do your best

157
00:14:17,164 --> 00:14:17,750
Yes

158
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:21,578
Good.
Receive instructions from personnel

159
00:14:22,266 --> 00:14:22,758
Yes

160
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:25,821
I'm Iwanami, a personnel manager

161
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,508
I'm oldest here

162
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:35,211
I've been working hard in the army

163
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:41,891
Both the captain and he are very intimidating

164
00:14:42,938 --> 00:14:47,891
There are many veteran soldiers here

165
00:14:48,438 --> 00:14:52,610
You all seem very high and mighty.

166
00:14:53,118 --> 00:14:54,618
I'm back!

167
00:14:54,891 --> 00:14:56,211
I'm back!

168
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:57,696
Say loud!

169
00:14:58,531 --> 00:14:59,859
I'm back!

170
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:01,657
I'm back!

171
00:15:04,977 --> 00:15:07,508
Hey, come here guys

172
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:08,742
Yes

173
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,438
What year are you?

174
00:15:17,578 --> 00:15:18,735
I'm 3rd year

175
00:15:18,767 --> 00:15:20,289
Are you active soldier?

176
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:21,946
I'm active

177
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:25,118
You lack training

178
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:26,743
Listen

179
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:30,445
You still lack experience

180
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:36,735
There are a lot of 5 and 6 year old soldiers here

181
00:15:37,094 --> 00:15:37,532
Yes

182
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:45,328
What's wrong?

183
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:47,743
It's nothing

184
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:48,711
What?

185
00:15:49,852 --> 00:15:50,578
What year are you?

186
00:15:51,086 --> 00:15:51,672
First year

187
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:53,203
First year?

188
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,836
Don't speak cheeky

189
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:01,883
Don't laugh

190
00:16:03,274 --> 00:16:06,586
I'll teach you

191
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,282
Open your legs

192
00:16:24,633 --> 00:16:28,625
Omiya quickly became popular on this army.

193
00:16:47,703 --> 00:16:49,008
Move forward

194
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:17,922
Oh shit

195
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:20,868
What's wrong?

196
00:17:21,766 --> 00:17:23,000
I lost muzzle

197
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,071
You should give up

198
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:28,266
It's gone

199
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,250
Oh shit

200
00:17:32,242 --> 00:17:33,266
I'll give you mine

201
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:35,953
If you do that you will be punished

202
00:17:36,813 --> 00:17:38,532
I can't be bothered with you.

203
00:17:39,688 --> 00:17:40,735
Never mind

204
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:44,422
Your sister took care of me

205
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:48,133
So I need to help you

206
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,446
This is something small

207
00:17:51,008 --> 00:17:53,453
I see.
Then I'll take it

208
00:17:55,149 --> 00:17:56,078
But yours..

209
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:08,118
Here it is

210
00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:29,700
I'm tired

211
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:31,473
I'll have a bath

212
00:18:37,395 --> 00:18:38,638
He's good singer

213
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,098
Excuse me

214
00:18:57,278 --> 00:18:57,856
Excuse me

215
00:19:08,544 --> 00:19:10,091
It is good weather

216
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,786
Yes true

217
00:19:15,669 --> 00:19:16,419
Well

218
00:19:17,747 --> 00:19:20,036
Do you guys have a lot of experience?

219
00:19:20,372 --> 00:19:24,911
I'm from the Kwantung Army

220
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,083
Lately

221
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:28,341
from the Kwantung Army

222
00:19:28,888 --> 00:19:30,372
Did you come from around the border?

223
00:19:30,684 --> 00:19:32,653
Yes there

224
00:19:32,678 --> 00:19:33,786
Oh I see

225
00:19:35,763 --> 00:19:38,388
I'm Araki from the 3rd unit

226
00:19:38,481 --> 00:19:40,395
I'm Uzaki from the 3rd unit

227
00:19:41,403 --> 00:19:44,661
I see.
Are you a sergeant

228
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:45,614
Yes

229
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:49,270
I'll wash your back

230
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,927
Wait wait

231
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:54,567
You have a nice figure

232
00:19:58,528 --> 00:19:59,661
I feel good

233
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:04,263
I want to ask you something

234
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:06,981
Is there a beautiful woman in this town?

235
00:20:07,216 --> 00:20:07,888
Women?

236
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,129
Lately I had no sex life

237
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,817
There is a comfort station near here

238
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:19,239
There are many good women when you go to Japan town

239
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,669
Really?

240
00:20:21,364 --> 00:20:22,372
Geisha girls are there

241
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,138
Geisha?

242
00:20:23,223 --> 00:20:25,833
I definitely want to go there

243
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:28,981
I got out

244
00:20:29,497 --> 00:20:30,708
Thank you

245
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:47,684
Salute!

246
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,114
He seems to like women

247
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:59,184
Yes true

248
00:21:03,661 --> 00:21:04,770
He forgot this

249
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:06,091
I'll send him

250
00:21:06,997 --> 00:21:08,591
Omiya 1st grade soldier

251
00:21:09,098 --> 00:21:10,567
Omiya 1st grade soldier

252
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:11,380
Still 1st grade soldier?

253
00:21:11,427 --> 00:21:13,161
That kid!

254
00:21:18,716 --> 00:21:19,505
Salute!

255
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,130
Stay

256
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,388
Omiya

257
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:38,896
reply

258
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:41,583
Yes

259
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:44,466
You've forgotten

260
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:50,411
Take it.
I found this

261
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,114
Why are you afraid?

262
00:22:00,091 --> 00:22:02,607
You were very intimidating in the bathroom

263
00:22:04,443 --> 00:22:09,068
This unit is very tough

264
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:09,833
You understand?

265
00:22:12,357 --> 00:22:13,309
You understand?

266
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,364
Clench your teeth and open your crotch

267
00:22:25,669 --> 00:22:26,474
Chief

268
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,685
I sanction him

269
00:22:31,138 --> 00:22:31,849
What?

270
00:22:33,075 --> 00:22:34,372
I am his comrade

271
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,318
It's your fault that he's no good

272
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:42,060
Ok, you sanction him

273
00:22:42,513 --> 00:22:42,989
Yes

274
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:46,833
What's wrong?

275
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:49,443
You hit him as a sanction

276
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:54,005
Hitting him only hurts my hand

277
00:22:54,841 --> 00:22:57,310
Are you a man?

278
00:22:57,872 --> 00:23:00,880
OK. I will show you

279
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:02,700
Ready?

280
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:09,568
Ouch!

281
00:23:11,029 --> 00:23:13,435
That's what I told you

282
00:23:22,036 --> 00:23:23,114
See you guys

283
00:23:29,763 --> 00:23:30,794
Damn it

284
00:23:49,646 --> 00:23:51,146
Do you know where is Omiya?

285
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:52,950
He's just gone out

286
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,107
with other party

287
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:55,685
Which party?

288
00:23:55,864 --> 00:23:56,575
I don't know

289
00:23:59,474 --> 00:24:03,904
I thought he was called by another unit

290
00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:09,458
I thought yesterday's sergeants would get him back

291
00:24:10,622 --> 00:24:12,271
Kitagawa is here

292
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:14,739
You were Sumo wrestler,right?

293
00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:16,154
Yes I was

294
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,138
What class?

295
00:24:17,935 --> 00:24:19,036
Juryo class

296
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,052
Juryo class?

297
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,482
What is your specialty?

298
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,036
Stakeout.

299
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:38,138
Knock him down with a stake.

300
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:40,497
Is it okay to stun him?

301
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:41,185
It's OK

302
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:42,052
Beat him

303
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,294
Yes sir

304
00:24:48,716 --> 00:24:50,224
He has a hard face

305
00:25:00,911 --> 00:25:01,779
Damn it

306
00:25:19,325 --> 00:25:20,161
Beat him!

307
00:25:20,779 --> 00:25:21,779
Beat him!

308
00:25:48,669 --> 00:25:50,232
You've given up?

309
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,161
You are a weak guy

310
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:55,763
Stand up!

311
00:26:07,302 --> 00:26:08,544
Beat you!

312
00:26:17,896 --> 00:26:18,747
Fuck you!

313
00:26:20,982 --> 00:26:22,364
You are here as I thought

314
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,661
Stop it!

315
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:27,177
Omiya!

316
00:26:33,763 --> 00:26:36,997
Sanctions on him should have ended yesterday

317
00:26:37,841 --> 00:26:39,771
And There is no reason to sanction him

318
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:40,560
What?

319
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:44,997
You guys misunderstood him as an instructor

320
00:26:45,825 --> 00:26:48,497
It's not his fault.

321
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:55,435
Is it okay for newcomers to dominate in the bathroom?

322
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:00,841
Is it okay for newcomers to use the group leader?

323
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,943
He was born with a face like this.

324
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,747
It's not his fault.

325
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,294
So we are trying to change his face

326
00:27:10,849 --> 00:27:12,614
Shall I change your face too?

327
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:16,591
You can treat this guy too

328
00:27:17,575 --> 00:27:18,505
I get it

329
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:21,911
Stand up!

330
00:27:52,622 --> 00:27:53,364
Fuck you!

331
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:01,864
Your turn!

332
00:28:02,036 --> 00:28:03,302
Stop it!

333
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,935
help us!

334
00:28:07,779 --> 00:28:09,036
Forgive me!

335
00:28:14,122 --> 00:28:15,599
Stop it,Omiya!

336
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,146
After this incident, Omiya was spotted by the Unit.

337
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:44,794
I consulted with President Yagi, who is the most serious in the unit.

338
00:28:46,943 --> 00:28:49,482
Please protect Omiya

339
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:52,583
I'm in trouble.

340
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:57,474
There is no problem if it is inland

341
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:00,044
We have live ammunition for the guns

342
00:29:01,302 --> 00:29:03,029
It ’s a very dangerous place.

343
00:29:08,755 --> 00:29:11,497
Can you treat him as a special soldier?

344
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:13,544
I have to manage him?

345
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,450
Then he doesn't have to work with them

346
00:29:20,638 --> 00:29:23,536
But can he work properly?

347
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,622
It's okay until the current situation settles down

348
00:29:28,114 --> 00:29:28,919
Please!

349
00:29:29,693 --> 00:29:34,060
Since then, Mr. Omiya has been given a special job.

350
00:29:34,482 --> 00:29:38,068
He is doing the woman's work.

351
00:29:38,419 --> 00:29:42,716
He is cleaning, washing and cleaning the bath

352
00:29:42,771 --> 00:29:48,255
He also prepares meals and buys meals

353
00:29:49,403 --> 00:29:50,356
Who am I?

354
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:52,568
I'm sorry, sir.

355
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,568
I'm the reincarnation of Mr. Omiya.

356
00:29:56,161 --> 00:30:03,029
I'll try my best to explain him.

357
00:30:13,505 --> 00:30:14,239
Excuse me

358
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:16,755
Come in

359
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,161
I brought you some watermelon.

360
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,013
Sit down

361
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:26,669
How's your work?
It's easy,right?

362
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:32,520
You can go out and see girls

363
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:36,239
You should thank to us

364
00:30:37,591 --> 00:30:42,036
I asked our boss that you work as helper

365
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:46,669
I won

366
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:48,544
I lost again

367
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:49,669
I quit

368
00:30:50,872 --> 00:30:52,599
Mr.Yagi has no luck

369
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,497
Can you play this?

370
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:56,809
I can't

371
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,036
Try it

372
00:30:58,349 --> 00:31:00,505
I don't want to deal with him.

373
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,466
Try it

374
00:31:04,309 --> 00:31:05,661
I have no money

375
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:07,794
I give you money

376
00:31:10,114 --> 00:31:11,052
5 yen is enough

377
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:13,169
Thank you

378
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:15,411
I take it

379
00:31:22,536 --> 00:31:23,630
Leader

380
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:24,645
What?

381
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:28,395
Let's keep our statuses equal when it comes to
gambling.

382
00:31:29,403 --> 00:31:30,380
What do you mean?

383
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:36,466
Even if I won,I might be the case I got nothing

384
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:40,169
Don't worry.
Trust me

385
00:31:41,388 --> 00:31:42,208
Then I will play

386
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:49,309
Please

387
00:31:57,591 --> 00:31:59,020
How much it will be?

388
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:01,653
Up to you

389
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:03,794
start from 3 yen

390
00:32:06,622 --> 00:32:07,130
Here

391
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:08,177
Please

392
00:32:11,497 --> 00:32:12,356
It's coming now

393
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:14,497
You didn't get this?

394
00:32:17,325 --> 00:32:18,254
It seems you are used to it

395
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:19,622
Kind of

396
00:32:28,099 --> 00:32:28,778
My turn

397
00:32:28,803 --> 00:32:29,520
Sorry

398
00:32:32,356 --> 00:32:33,153
I take it

399
00:32:33,606 --> 00:32:34,458
What?

400
00:32:34,841 --> 00:32:35,442
I won

401
00:32:35,707 --> 00:32:36,301
Sorry

402
00:32:37,005 --> 00:32:37,911
You are used to this game

403
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,036
Well..I was just lucky

404
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:41,997
Don't say bullshit

405
00:32:42,817 --> 00:32:43,966
Let's keep our statuses equal

406
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:46,145
I take this

407
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,481
I return the money you lend me

408
00:32:52,536 --> 00:32:54,067
I won many times

409
00:33:00,403 --> 00:33:01,755


410
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:03,895
I'm lucky

411
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,927
well..this is my first time I won that many times

412
00:33:16,997 --> 00:33:18,021
I have to save my money

413
00:33:19,317 --> 00:33:21,200
I can borrow you some money

414
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,927
I'm here to tell you something

415
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,677
How's going?

416
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,091
Yes I'm doing well

417
00:33:39,146 --> 00:33:42,474
I thought you were doing well

418
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,192
I bought this on the way of shopping

419
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:49,067
This is sake, so rare

420
00:33:49,317 --> 00:33:50,591
I went to the town

421
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:51,778
It must cost a lot

422
00:33:51,981 --> 00:33:55,325
I got the money from the president so it's okay

423
00:33:55,528 --> 00:33:56,474
I won a bet.

424
00:34:01,161 --> 00:34:04,271
I have something I want you to write

425
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:06,474
Write what?

426
00:34:08,177 --> 00:34:08,856
A letter

427
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:13,044
To Kyoko Ogata

428
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:15,333
Do you want me to write for you?

429
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,896
You can't write?

430
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:21,583
I can write little

431
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:24,521
You're big but you can't do anything

432
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:25,239
I am a carnivore

433
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:25,997
Stupid

434
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,044
I won't write for you

435
00:34:30,231 --> 00:34:36,138
Please write by all means

436
00:34:36,567 --> 00:34:37,973
You just have to write the lyrics

437
00:34:38,638 --> 00:34:39,896
Please write

438
00:34:40,505 --> 00:34:41,138
What should I write?

439
00:34:43,638 --> 00:34:44,692
Write I love her

440
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:48,958
You mean it?

441
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:55,013
You have a pure heart.

442
00:34:55,231 --> 00:34:56,317
For her

443
00:34:57,356 --> 00:35:01,239
I've always loved different women but she's special

444
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:04,130
She's very nice

445
00:35:06,036 --> 00:35:07,278
I should have made a confession

446
00:35:10,146 --> 00:35:11,794
You have me Sake so it can't helped

447
00:35:16,153 --> 00:35:17,536
Please give me some more sake.

448
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,481
I'll like more like sexy

449
00:35:21,669 --> 00:35:22,692
Please write seriously

450
00:35:24,192 --> 00:35:24,731
Ok

451
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,489
Omiya! come on

452
00:35:49,763 --> 00:35:50,489
Yes

453
00:35:55,231 --> 00:35:56,153
Thank you for your work

454
00:35:57,896 --> 00:35:59,450
Come in

455
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:06,005
There is a soldier

456
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,067
Don't worry

457
00:36:13,216 --> 00:36:13,966
Do you have a sake?

458
00:36:14,317 --> 00:36:15,200
Yes

459
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:17,114
Is there a bath?

460
00:36:18,731 --> 00:36:20,052
The bath is ready

461
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,067
I want to take a bath

462
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:24,035
Let's take a bath together

463
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:27,458
Where did Mr. Yagi go?

464
00:36:27,483 --> 00:36:30,021
He is busy with war

465
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:36,692
How's your bath?

466
00:36:37,192 --> 00:36:38,481
Just fine

467
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:40,138
Wash my back

468
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,216
Yes

469
00:36:41,888 --> 00:36:43,958
Come in

470
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,481
May I?

471
00:36:47,177 --> 00:36:48,427
Come in!

472
00:36:49,872 --> 00:36:50,763
Yes

473
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,372
I'll come in

474
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,825
Wash her back

475
00:37:00,091 --> 00:37:00,786
Yes

476
00:37:03,146 --> 00:37:03,981
Excuse me

477
00:37:04,481 --> 00:37:05,567
Thank you

478
00:37:08,052 --> 00:37:08,856
Omiya

479
00:37:09,513 --> 00:37:12,388
It's rare to see a woman naked

480
00:37:12,958 --> 00:37:13,888
Wash carefully

481
00:37:14,224 --> 00:37:14,849
Yes

482
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:36,075
Come here

483
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,263
He can hear

484
00:37:51,224 --> 00:37:52,185
Never mind

485
00:38:00,583 --> 00:38:01,497
President!

486
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:02,630
What?

487
00:38:03,685 --> 00:38:04,778
I'll go for shopping

488
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:07,833
What?
What you will buy?

489
00:38:08,755 --> 00:38:09,958
It's a must-have item

490
00:38:13,614 --> 00:38:16,075
Soldiers are not accepted at night

491
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,927
I'll give you some money, so thank you.

492
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:22,161
It is a rule not to work after dinner

493
00:38:22,286 --> 00:38:23,911
I can't wait

494
00:38:23,936 --> 00:38:25,403
She is free,isn't she?

495
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,872
If found, there will be penalties.

496
00:38:28,317 --> 00:38:29,685
Take it!

497
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:40,231
Oh you

498
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:42,809
Thank you for your time the other day.

499
00:38:43,856 --> 00:38:45,146
How are you?

500
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:46,919
What?

501
00:39:00,028 --> 00:39:03,599
Oh you.. what are you doing here?

502
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:05,575
It's a rule violation

503
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:06,888
I know

504
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:14,075
I came here to give a message from the president

505
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:15,122
You are kidding

506
00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:16,341
I'm not

507
00:39:16,379 --> 00:39:16,926
Right?

508
00:39:17,247 --> 00:39:17,794
Yes

509
00:39:18,888 --> 00:39:19,552
Really

510
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,396
You bastard

511
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:23,036
Damn it

512
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:26,505
I didn't know you are helper now

513
00:39:27,755 --> 00:39:29,075
let's go

514
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:43,419
Thank you

515
00:39:44,083 --> 00:39:46,435
I like soldiers better

516
00:39:47,146 --> 00:39:48,130
Are you first year soldier?

517
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:50,965
I like them most

518
00:39:51,591 --> 00:39:52,638
Because it's cute

519
00:39:54,747 --> 00:39:58,739
But you look like a very veteran face

520
00:40:03,224 --> 00:40:04,497
I can hear

521
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,458
Look above

522
00:40:06,763 --> 00:40:07,974
The ceiling is connected

523
00:40:10,216 --> 00:40:10,896
Really

524
00:40:40,466 --> 00:40:41,247
What's wrong?

525
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:45,294
Kimura hasn't come back yet

526
00:40:49,723 --> 00:40:51,364
He's three hours late

527
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,060
Did you check

528
00:40:53,185 --> 00:40:54,529
He is not here

529
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:55,841
I see

530
00:40:58,786 --> 00:40:59,747
Find him!

531
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,185
Will you stay here tonight?

532
00:41:03,763 --> 00:41:06,919
A young soldier named Kimura escaped

533
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,091
Kimura?

534
00:41:09,615 --> 00:41:11,232
He escaped well

535
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,201
He'll be found soon

536
00:41:14,146 --> 00:41:15,029
Really?

537
00:41:15,716 --> 00:41:16,723
Of course

538
00:41:16,927 --> 00:41:18,740
It's easy. Kenpei team will find him

539
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:22,802
But it can be difficult to catch him

540
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:24,888
Do you know Kenpei team ?

541
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,576
I had a little relationship before

542
00:41:30,794 --> 00:41:33,715
I think it's easy to get away from the army

543
00:41:34,396 --> 00:41:35,841
Don't be a prude.

544
00:41:36,982 --> 00:41:37,935
Why you don't escape?

545
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:43,286
Because I have my reasons.

546
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:52,911
Good evening

547
00:41:55,607 --> 00:41:59,083
Iwanami leader is not here tonight

548
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:01,583
I know that

549
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:03,966
Yagi leader is here?

550
00:42:04,341 --> 00:42:05,615
He's here

551
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:08,318
May I see him?

552
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,966
I didn't know that

553
00:42:20,349 --> 00:42:23,302
She is very feminine tonight

554
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:24,888
Women are mysterious creatures

555
00:42:25,474 --> 00:42:27,724
If Mr. Iwanami finds out, it will be very serious.

556
00:42:29,654 --> 00:42:33,443
I want to take you home with me when I'm discharged.

557
00:42:34,193 --> 00:42:35,138
Really

558
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:40,646
I'm happy with your feelings

559
00:42:42,857 --> 00:42:44,255
But I'm bad

560
00:42:45,068 --> 00:42:46,270
I'm not good enough for you

561
00:42:46,295 --> 00:42:48,247
I'm serious

562
00:42:50,826 --> 00:42:52,966
I can't be discharged as long as the war lasts.

563
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,021
I may possibly go to the South.

564
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:01,154
But wherever I go, my feelings don't change

565
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,701
To south?

566
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,466
You're getting into a tougher situation

567
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,669
I'm sad if you are gone

568
00:43:14,427 --> 00:43:16,544
We can't do anything

569
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,685
But I won't forget about you

570
00:43:43,028 --> 00:43:44,661
Can I have some water?

571
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:53,153
Here it is

572
00:43:58,677 --> 00:43:59,778
It tastes good

573
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:02,200
Don't tell Iwanami leader

574
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:04,724
I know

575
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:07,286
You have a hard time

576
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:11,349
Be patient

577
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,310
Omiya,I'm Iwanami

578
00:44:21,435 --> 00:44:22,255
Yes

579
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:24,278
Omiya!

580
00:44:24,974 --> 00:44:25,763
I'll open soon

581
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:30,575
Oh my god

582
00:44:31,224 --> 00:44:32,333
Please hide

583
00:44:32,896 --> 00:44:33,568
To where?

584
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,544
There is a closet

585
00:44:38,739 --> 00:44:40,200
Open now!

586
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:41,044
I'll open soon

587
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:42,099
Your clothes

588
00:44:52,943 --> 00:44:53,872
What were you doing?

589
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,771
I was sleeping

590
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,489
I thought you would stay

591
00:44:59,568 --> 00:45:01,458
I was planed to stay over but we found the Kimura

592
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:04,294
There was such a contact

593
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:05,568
Oh I see

594
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:07,919
You should have stayed over

595
00:45:08,130 --> 00:45:08,982
What did you say?

596
00:45:09,458 --> 00:45:10,685
Thank you for your hard work

597
00:45:58,565 --> 00:45:59,401
I feel cold

598
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:16,877
You are mean

599
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:03,190
Awwww

600
00:47:07,495 --> 00:47:08,073
What?

601
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:19,448
Ah!

602
00:47:20,346 --> 00:47:21,354
I feel cold

603
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:23,588
What are you doing?

604
00:47:26,534 --> 00:47:27,424
I'm sorry

605
00:47:28,041 --> 00:47:28,948
Did you bring her?

606
00:47:30,565 --> 00:47:31,299
Yes

607
00:47:31,666 --> 00:47:32,346
What?

608
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:35,471
Stop it!

609
00:47:37,612 --> 00:47:38,893
I'm Geisha girl

610
00:47:39,932 --> 00:47:41,854
I sleep anyone who pay me

611
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:43,424
Is that bad?

612
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,987
I don't care you sleep anyone

613
00:47:46,588 --> 00:47:47,916
So why you are upset?

614
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,745
You had sex behind my back.

615
00:47:51,252 --> 00:47:52,018
Stop it!

616
00:47:55,385 --> 00:47:56,534
I called her

617
00:47:57,065 --> 00:47:57,588
What?

618
00:47:59,315 --> 00:48:00,752
Why you slept with Omiya?

619
00:48:03,557 --> 00:48:04,846
You are lying

620
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:08,784
If you bring her, you should sleep with her, right?

621
00:48:09,065 --> 00:48:10,065
Why you try to cheat me?

622
00:48:11,705 --> 00:48:15,526
You could have just asked me for advice.

623
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:17,135
She is just whore

624
00:48:17,807 --> 00:48:18,823
Don't insult her

625
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,026
What?

626
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:24,284
That's why you can't do your job at all.

627
00:48:25,377 --> 00:48:30,018
You've been hit and run away when you were a newcomer

628
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:31,088
You are weak man

629
00:48:31,549 --> 00:48:32,948
You are stupid

630
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:33,963
What?

631
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:35,612
I said you are stupid

632
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:39,205
It's my choice to like Mr. Yagi.

633
00:48:40,854 --> 00:48:41,541
You like him?

634
00:48:42,276 --> 00:48:43,096
Yes I love him

635
00:48:44,534 --> 00:48:46,635
I won't sleep with you anymore

636
00:48:48,065 --> 00:48:48,830
It's funny

637
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:51,471
You said you sleep with anyone for money

638
00:48:52,612 --> 00:48:54,448
I won't sleep with you anymore

639
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:57,635
It ’s better to sleep with a bear than to sleep with you.

640
00:48:57,971 --> 00:48:59,495
I'll make her to return home

641
00:49:02,948 --> 00:49:04,127
My clothes

642
00:49:04,152 --> 00:49:05,073
Never mind

643
00:49:24,643 --> 00:49:26,510
I was fired a helper

644
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:30,526
We just got word that the enemy is here.

645
00:49:31,073 --> 00:49:33,682
I went to battle

646
00:49:56,182 --> 00:49:56,901
Go!

647
00:50:19,932 --> 00:50:24,143
The enemy escaped after attacking the village

648
00:50:24,737 --> 00:50:30,143
Only the old man and the daughter remained

649
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:37,698
Go!

650
00:50:44,713 --> 00:50:45,838
Only two

651
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:47,362
There was no result

652
00:50:47,510 --> 00:50:52,580
Do we report them as important people?

653
00:50:52,877 --> 00:50:53,448
Yes

654
00:50:54,112 --> 00:50:56,557
Have him shot.

655
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:59,963
Why don't you let a new solider kill him?

656
00:51:00,752 --> 00:51:02,377
Yes let's do it

657
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:03,854
How about woman?

658
00:51:07,596 --> 00:51:09,487
It's a waste to kill a woman

659
00:51:27,979 --> 00:51:29,487
Confine her

660
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:37,924
Bring your guns!

661
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:43,955
Ready?

662
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,080
We've decided to put him to death.

663
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:55,526
You need to practice

664
00:51:56,541 --> 00:51:59,659
Kill him and gain experience

665
00:52:00,338 --> 00:52:04,526
Kill this old man and practice

666
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:06,776
Ready

667
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,104
Leader

668
00:52:10,612 --> 00:52:11,409
Will you wait?

669
00:52:11,659 --> 00:52:12,198
What?

670
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:17,518
This old man is obviously sick

671
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:21,393
Killing sick people, even in training, is not a good
idea.

672
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,440
What did you say?

673
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:28,135
Do you have any solid evidence that this old man is related to the
military?

674
00:52:28,526 --> 00:52:30,588
I don't care about evidence.

675
00:52:30,752 --> 00:52:33,909
Even enemies have a right to be treated fairly.

676
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:35,760
You

677
00:52:37,549 --> 00:52:39,799
Do not disobey my orders!

678
00:52:44,682 --> 00:52:45,541
I mean

679
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:52,010
If you kill this old man, you'll make enemies in return.

680
00:52:52,885 --> 00:52:57,994
It will only provoke the enemy.

681
00:52:58,307 --> 00:52:59,252
Shout up

682
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,377
You preach to me?

683
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:04,783
I'm a soldier, but I like to have an opinion.

684
00:53:05,627 --> 00:53:08,198
You have a military mindset.

685
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,205
You guys follow me

686
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:20,143
Get Ready!

687
00:53:22,635 --> 00:53:23,494
Wait!

688
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,119
Do not follow his orders.

689
00:53:27,144 --> 00:53:28,127
Fuck you!

690
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,760
Get Ready!

691
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:33,455
Get Ready!

692
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,909
Hey guys, stop it

693
00:53:43,737 --> 00:53:44,494
Damn it

694
00:53:54,096 --> 00:53:55,315
Stop it,Iwanami leader

695
00:53:56,237 --> 00:53:57,159
What did you say?

696
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,955
Hey listen

697
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:06,877
Call off the execution.

698
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:08,315
Leader

699
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:12,518
Lock this man up somewhere.

700
00:54:26,034 --> 00:54:27,659
You did good job

701
00:54:28,994 --> 00:54:30,541
I've changed my mind about you.

702
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:35,112
But there may be a punishment.

703
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:02,534
What Can I do for you?

704
00:55:03,338 --> 00:55:06,252
Do you feel like a hero?

705
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,166
Don't be proud too much

706
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:11,588
So what?

707
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:12,744
Come

708
00:55:33,799 --> 00:55:34,729
Fuck you!

709
00:56:07,354 --> 00:56:09,869
Dinner is not ready?

710
00:56:11,134 --> 00:56:11,369
We'll get ready soon

711
00:56:15,212 --> 00:56:15,876
Excuse me

712
00:56:17,969 --> 00:56:19,212
Where is Arita?

713
00:56:53,532 --> 00:56:54,321
Arita-san

714
00:56:56,829 --> 00:56:57,532
I'm OK

715
00:56:58,071 --> 00:57:00,149
It's a terrible injury.

716
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:02,884
That leaders hit you?

717
00:57:04,415 --> 00:57:05,470
How many?

718
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:09,548
I'm going to get even.

719
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:10,391
Wait

720
00:57:13,165 --> 00:57:15,852
I have no patience for this.

721
00:57:16,618 --> 00:57:17,555
Omiya

722
00:57:18,759 --> 00:57:22,352
I'm going to be a problem in military council.

723
00:57:23,587 --> 00:57:26,040
I don't want to get you involved.

724
00:57:26,712 --> 00:57:27,845
Never mind

725
00:57:28,876 --> 00:57:32,977
I've always hated him.

726
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:34,430
Omiya!

727
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,290
Omiya!

728
00:57:48,735 --> 00:57:50,571
Can you come with me,Kurozume leader?

729
00:57:51,376 --> 00:57:52,516
What the hell?

730
00:57:54,134 --> 00:57:58,641
I'm here to get even with you, Mr. Arai.

731
00:57:59,695 --> 00:58:01,274
What the hell?

732
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:02,688
Omiya!

733
00:58:03,891 --> 00:58:08,516
This is the military.
Don't get me wrong.

734
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:09,891
Don't look down us

735
00:58:44,774 --> 00:58:45,602
Fuck you!

736
00:58:58,423 --> 00:58:59,423
Fuck you!

737
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:20,368
Fuck you!

738
00:59:22,462 --> 00:59:23,235
Damn it!

739
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:31,477
Wait, dude!

740
00:59:32,305 --> 00:59:32,938
Ouch!

741
00:59:36,899 --> 00:59:37,657
Fuck you!

742
00:59:38,407 --> 00:59:39,407
Help me!

743
00:59:43,415 --> 00:59:47,688
It was the captain's order to hit Arita.

744
00:59:53,266 --> 00:59:54,985
What's wrong?Omiya

745
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:57,149
Where is leader

746
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,149
He's on patrol

747
01:00:00,047 --> 01:00:03,547
The other captain gave the order and hit Arita-san.

748
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:05,353
So what?

749
01:00:05,704 --> 01:00:07,688
Why you don't care?

750
01:00:08,165 --> 01:00:09,728
Keep him safe.

751
01:00:10,845 --> 01:00:12,446
Are you here to fight with me?

752
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:13,103
Yeah

753
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:17,306
Omiya

754
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:21,173
Your actions will only annoy Arita more and more.

755
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,790
Is that OK with you?

756
01:00:25,274 --> 01:00:28,876
He was beaten, but it never came up in the meeting.

757
01:00:30,328 --> 01:00:33,031
If you make things even bigger, we're in trouble.

758
01:00:37,868 --> 01:00:41,071
If you're worried about him, be quiet.

759
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:43,290
Damn it

760
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,524
Why you don't understand

761
01:00:44,595 --> 01:00:45,517
I understand

762
01:00:46,829 --> 01:00:48,220
The captain was trying to get him to do something
rash.

763
01:00:57,259 --> 01:00:58,532
There is no problem

764
01:01:13,438 --> 01:01:16,907
We're going to interrogate a woman today, so bring her in at
10:00.

765
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:17,688
Yes

766
01:01:18,267 --> 01:01:19,970
Listen, only woman

767
01:01:20,157 --> 01:01:20,728
Yes

768
01:01:25,532 --> 01:01:26,978
He is pervert

769
01:01:27,407 --> 01:01:28,759
He wants to have sex with her

770
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:31,454
I'm going to sabotage it.

771
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:56,251
I'm sorry

772
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:03,930
Be quiet

773
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,134
Stay down

774
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:18,032
Go, Go!

775
01:02:18,665 --> 01:02:19,829
Get out

776
01:02:33,712 --> 01:02:35,079
Thank you

777
01:02:56,173 --> 01:02:58,462
Oh you are here

778
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:02,728
How's your condition?

779
01:03:05,118 --> 01:03:05,884
I'm fine

780
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:10,478
Your face looks funny

781
01:03:11,462 --> 01:03:12,868
Never mind

782
01:03:51,345 --> 01:03:52,860
It's so quiet

783
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:01,063
Nights like this make me sentimental.

784
01:04:03,735 --> 01:04:04,728
Yes

785
01:04:06,493 --> 01:04:07,618
You think so?

786
01:04:09,079 --> 01:04:11,103
It reminds me of when I was a kid.

787
01:04:11,798 --> 01:04:15,978
My father beat me and I spent all night staring at the stars.

788
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:18,595
Were you crying?

789
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,228
I was pretty when I was a kid.

790
01:04:27,751 --> 01:04:28,892
But

791
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:31,696
Human destiny is a mystery.

792
01:04:32,923 --> 01:04:38,313
If I hadn't joined the army, I never would have met you.

793
01:04:41,337 --> 01:04:42,173
That's true

794
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:51,907
I didn't even see Nurse Ogata.

795
01:04:52,617 --> 01:04:55,813
Being in the military is not a bad thing.

796
01:04:56,462 --> 01:04:59,267
You are stupid.
You like being in the military ?

797
01:05:00,282 --> 01:05:02,728
I don't mean that

798
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:05,681
We try to be free to do what you want in the
army.

799
01:05:09,641 --> 01:05:13,126
Your way of life may be more decent than me

800
01:05:15,032 --> 01:05:17,415
You're still very human.

801
01:05:20,110 --> 01:05:23,446
You are a much more natural and free person than I am

802
01:05:26,212 --> 01:05:27,657
The prisoners have escaped

803
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:30,946
The prisoners have escaped

804
01:05:30,971 --> 01:05:32,141
This is the problem

805
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:36,047
They have run away completely

806
01:05:37,297 --> 01:05:38,251
You did it?

807
01:05:40,712 --> 01:05:43,594
I hate that leader so I did it

808
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,993
You really don't follow the discipline of the army

809
01:05:47,547 --> 01:05:50,305
I'll go talk to them.

810
01:05:50,330 --> 01:05:51,008
Wait

811
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:55,290
When they find out what you've done, you'll be shot.

812
01:05:57,337 --> 01:05:59,774
You are a really serious person

813
01:06:00,297 --> 01:06:04,446
Tomorrow is another day

814
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:09,587
Tomorrow will take care of itself

815
01:06:15,602 --> 01:06:16,251
It's the enemy!

816
01:07:13,610 --> 01:07:14,665
You guys,wait here

817
01:07:59,531 --> 01:08:04,508
I was punished for seven days for insubordination to a Corporal.

818
01:08:05,046 --> 01:08:08,593
Mr. Okada and Mr. Ishikawa were punished for 10 days because they escaped from prisoners of war.

819
01:08:10,258 --> 01:08:11,742
I felt responsible

820
01:08:16,336 --> 01:08:17,867
Your meal is here

821
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:19,078
Thanks

822
01:08:25,054 --> 01:08:26,398
How's here?

823
01:08:26,953 --> 01:08:29,101
You stupid.
Here is bad

824
01:08:31,867 --> 01:08:33,453
Please smoke

825
01:08:35,547 --> 01:08:36,672
You are kind

826
01:08:37,148 --> 01:08:39,289
I stayed here before

827
01:08:41,398 --> 01:08:42,539
How's army?

828
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,961
We're a little confused because of various incidents

829
01:08:46,695 --> 01:08:48,390
I think there will be bigger problems later

830
01:08:48,976 --> 01:08:49,687
Oh yeah

831
01:08:50,062 --> 01:08:53,937
Tokyo has been wiped out in a massive air raid.

832
01:08:55,265 --> 01:08:55,914
Really?

833
01:08:56,929 --> 01:08:58,445
This is a problem

834
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:03,968
We can't live too long

835
01:09:04,804 --> 01:09:08,828
President Yagi died in such a war

836
01:09:10,047 --> 01:09:12,679
People in the upper echelons are eating a good meal without participating in the war.

837
01:09:13,789 --> 01:09:15,062
That's not fair

838
01:09:16,164 --> 01:09:19,015
I don't want to give up my precious life

839
01:09:19,344 --> 01:09:23,375
Did you see Mr. Yagi's corpse?

840
01:09:23,820 --> 01:09:25,445
No.
What's wrong?

841
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:30,414
He was shot in the heart from his back.
The enemy has not killed him

842
01:09:32,203 --> 01:09:35,406
Someone on our side killed him

843
01:09:38,851 --> 01:09:44,976
You said earlier that Mr. Iwanami and Mr. Yagi had a fight over a female issue

844
01:09:46,523 --> 01:09:50,531
Besides the women, those two were always fighting.

845
01:09:51,844 --> 01:09:52,804
Iwanami leader?

846
01:09:54,469 --> 01:09:56,031
He may have killed Mr. Yagi

847
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:03,250
He may have killed Mr. Yagi

848
01:10:04,258 --> 01:10:06,062
Shall I look for ammunition in his bones?

849
01:10:07,742 --> 01:10:09,679
You can see who killed by looking at the ammunition

850
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:15,492
Can I get Mr. Iwanami's pistol?

851
01:10:18,101 --> 01:10:19,179
Leave it to me

852
01:10:58,633 --> 01:10:59,366
Omiya

853
01:11:02,554 --> 01:11:06,273
After the cremation, I'll stay at Yagi's house tonight

854
01:11:07,039 --> 01:11:07,984
You should come

855
01:11:28,187 --> 01:11:29,812
Bring Sake Omiya

856
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,031
Let's have a drink together tonight to pray for Yagi's soul

857
01:11:41,734 --> 01:11:43,656
It's a funeral

858
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,015
I'll go home

859
01:11:47,570 --> 01:11:48,547
What's wrong?

860
01:11:50,172 --> 01:11:52,008
I don't like dark moods.

861
01:11:54,828 --> 01:11:58,547
You are merciless.
Yagi loved you

862
01:11:59,844 --> 01:12:01,976
At least pray for him

863
01:12:03,179 --> 01:12:04,094
Ridiculous

864
01:12:05,258 --> 01:12:06,726
All my tears have died

865
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:12,617
Omiya

866
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:14,851
Drink more

867
01:12:18,304 --> 01:12:19,242
Yagi-san
You stupid

868
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:22,242
Why are you dead?

869
01:12:23,203 --> 01:12:24,101
You stupid

870
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,523
Someko.
Forget about him

871
01:12:30,461 --> 01:12:32,140
I've already forgotten about him

872
01:12:32,836 --> 01:12:33,648
You are liar

873
01:12:35,015 --> 01:12:38,148
Did you love him so much?

874
01:12:39,742 --> 01:12:40,883
No way

875
01:12:41,789 --> 01:12:43,547
I don't love anyone else

876
01:12:43,867 --> 01:12:45,156
Ridiculous

877
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:47,812
I don't like military personnel

878
01:12:54,976 --> 01:12:57,117
Shave your hair if you loved him

879
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:00,469
I'll cut your hair

880
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:02,500
What the hell

881
01:13:10,445 --> 01:13:11,328
Stop it

882
01:13:14,664 --> 01:13:15,469
Damn it

883
01:13:16,289 --> 01:13:17,101
Let me go

884
01:13:21,133 --> 01:13:21,953
Let me go

885
01:13:23,226 --> 01:13:24,226
Let me go

886
01:13:25,078 --> 01:13:25,804
Damn it

887
01:13:32,531 --> 01:13:33,359
OK

888
01:13:34,258 --> 01:13:35,969
Do whatever you want

889
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,562
Work hard

890
01:13:57,281 --> 01:13:58,023
Chief

891
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:01,265
I have a favor of you

892
01:14:01,290 --> 01:14:01,867
What?

893
01:14:01,892 --> 01:14:06,375
The car doesn't move so please lend me some people

894
01:14:07,273 --> 01:14:08,851
This is an urgent business

895
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:10,609
I see

896
01:14:10,634 --> 01:14:13,226
I'll get some people ready for you.

897
01:14:13,851 --> 01:14:14,953
Hey,Omiya

898
01:14:25,117 --> 01:14:27,015
Good luck because it's heavy

899
01:14:27,882 --> 01:14:28,484
Let's move

900
01:14:46,922 --> 01:14:47,648
What's wrong?

901
01:14:48,226 --> 01:14:49,094
You can't move the truck?

902
01:14:51,101 --> 01:14:52,125
I'll help them

903
01:14:58,719 --> 01:14:59,664
Ogata-san

904
01:15:01,890 --> 01:15:02,945
Oh Omiya-san

905
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:07,281
It's been a long time

906
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:08,937
You look good

907
01:15:09,468 --> 01:15:10,413
Thank you

908
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,101
You know him?

909
01:15:13,367 --> 01:15:15,437
I met him at the Army Hospital before

910
01:15:16,593 --> 01:15:18,811
Thank you for taking care of me at that time

911
01:15:21,046 --> 01:15:24,773
I still take good care of the amulet you gave me

912
01:15:29,413 --> 01:15:30,882
Let's try again

913
01:15:34,561 --> 01:15:36,436
Get out!

914
01:15:36,608 --> 01:15:37,788
I'll do it alone.

915
01:15:38,468 --> 01:15:39,413
Here we go

916
01:15:59,655 --> 01:16:01,171
Thank you

917
01:16:02,507 --> 01:16:05,468
You don't change at all

918
01:16:07,069 --> 01:16:10,991
I was ordered to transfer to a field hospital the other day

919
01:16:11,608 --> 01:16:12,686
Oh I see

920
01:16:13,061 --> 01:16:18,491
I'm very busy after being transferred and I'm in charge of your group

921
01:16:18,819 --> 01:16:21,194
How is my brother,Shiro?

922
01:16:23,936 --> 01:16:26,476
Ah..he's fine but

923
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:28,452
What's wrong with my brother?

924
01:16:30,976 --> 01:16:32,054
Well...

925
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:34,873
Please get in the car.
We're going

926
01:16:34,952 --> 01:16:35,561
Yes

927
01:16:35,819 --> 01:16:36,476
See you

928
01:16:37,358 --> 01:16:39,741
Talk to you later

929
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:04,257
May I see my brother?

930
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:09,608
That's a little difficult.
His disposal has not been decided yet

931
01:17:10,515 --> 01:17:13,890
He may be a problem at the meeting

932
01:17:16,499 --> 01:17:23,554
He's at least seven years in prison if it matters at a military meeting

933
01:17:25,296 --> 01:17:30,804
I don't mind any disposition .
I want to see him once

934
01:17:33,983 --> 01:17:43,272
Actually, you can't, but I'll give you a special once-over.

935
01:17:44,811 --> 01:17:45,835
Thank you

936
01:17:46,421 --> 01:17:47,874
But here is not good

937
01:17:49,351 --> 01:17:51,601
He'll meet you in secret at my place

938
01:17:54,304 --> 01:17:55,226
Hey helper

939
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:55,960
Yes

940
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:00,358
Bring some beer

941
01:18:00,468 --> 01:18:01,069
Yes

942
01:18:04,991 --> 01:18:07,702
This is not military equipment.
Make yourself at home

943
01:18:08,452 --> 01:18:09,085
Yes

944
01:18:09,960 --> 01:18:13,140
Oh yeah,
You can stay over tonight

945
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:14,257
What?

946
01:18:28,671 --> 01:18:31,186
Thanks for your work

947
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:34,390
It tastes good

948
01:18:36,202 --> 01:18:38,921
Leader, Kyoko is here

949
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:43,077
I see.
So you are upset

950
01:18:43,530 --> 01:18:46,952
But it's a little weird.
I asked army, and they said she's gone already

951
01:18:47,827 --> 01:18:51,186
If she were to leave, she'd come to me to say hello.

952
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:56,155
Didn't she go home early because of you?

953
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:00,788
But it's a little weird.

954
01:19:01,499 --> 01:19:03,218
It's strange to go home without saying anything

955
01:19:03,757 --> 01:19:04,429
Right?

956
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:20,106
The leader took the girls home for lunch, so I got the day off.

957
01:19:20,583 --> 01:19:21,365
Which woman?

958
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,466
She is a red cross nurse

959
01:19:23,661 --> 01:19:24,857
A nurse?

960
01:19:27,427 --> 01:19:28,294
Omiya!

961
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:32,927
No!

962
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:38,443
It's OK

963
01:19:39,161 --> 01:19:43,310
If you want to help your brother, sleep with me

964
01:19:45,029 --> 01:19:45,927
Stop it!

965
01:19:52,326 --> 01:19:54,552
I see.
You really hate

966
01:19:55,779 --> 01:19:58,341
So do whatever you want.
I don't care what will happen to your brother

967
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,068
Is that Ok with you?

968
01:20:09,786 --> 01:20:13,536
This is the place of war.
We don't know what will happen tomorrow

969
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:18,646
You have sex with me and no one knows

970
01:20:21,138 --> 01:20:21,857
No!

971
01:20:22,661 --> 01:20:23,857
Stay down

972
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:28,357
No!

973
01:20:41,701 --> 01:20:42,661
What the hell!

974
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,857
I am your leader!

975
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:51,200
You are not my leader

976
01:20:51,248 --> 01:20:51,966
What did you say?

977
01:20:52,263 --> 01:20:55,263
I'll also revenge the other day

978
01:20:59,529 --> 01:21:00,310
Fuck you

979
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:03,794
Stand up!

980
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,263
Omiya!

981
01:21:13,294 --> 01:21:14,177
Stop it!

982
01:21:16,591 --> 01:21:17,919
I don't care what happens to me.

983
01:21:18,326 --> 01:21:19,669
Say sorry to her

984
01:21:23,427 --> 01:21:24,552
Say sorry to her

985
01:21:24,997 --> 01:21:25,857
Fuck you

986
01:21:26,325 --> 01:21:27,349
Go to hell

987
01:21:28,232 --> 01:21:29,138
I get it

988
01:21:29,825 --> 01:21:30,825
I get it

989
01:21:31,435 --> 01:21:32,396
Forgive me

990
01:21:34,911 --> 01:21:39,263
You take her to see her brother?

991
01:21:39,638 --> 01:21:40,223
I do

992
01:21:40,248 --> 01:21:40,973
You sure?

993
01:21:40,998 --> 01:21:41,990
Yes trust me

994
01:21:45,497 --> 01:21:46,083
Hey

995
01:21:46,982 --> 01:21:47,849
Thanks

996
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:54,489
The leader's orders are for her to visit her brother.

997
01:21:54,646 --> 01:21:55,372
What?

998
01:21:55,646 --> 01:21:57,615
This is our leader's order

999
01:21:58,818 --> 01:21:59,872
Are you sure?

1000
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,005
OK come in

1001
01:22:10,708 --> 01:22:11,505
Omiya

1002
01:22:15,286 --> 01:22:15,950
Omiya

1003
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:18,693
You're going to be punished.

1004
01:22:20,747 --> 01:22:21,779
Are you try to run away again?

1005
01:22:24,029 --> 01:22:25,060
How about you?

1006
01:22:26,396 --> 01:22:28,513
I can't let you escape alone

1007
01:22:30,247 --> 01:22:31,372
Shall we escape together?

1008
01:22:33,396 --> 01:22:35,497
I don't want to separate with you

1009
01:22:38,263 --> 01:22:39,161
Me too

1010
01:22:44,552 --> 01:22:46,247
They are coming to try to catch us

1011
01:22:48,169 --> 01:22:50,044
Leave it to me

1012
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,060
Stat down!

1013
01:23:04,927 --> 01:23:06,325
We won't escape

1014
01:23:12,950 --> 01:23:14,365
We've brought them

1015
01:23:16,497 --> 01:23:17,677
Line up there

1016
01:23:19,825 --> 01:23:20,599
Omiya

1017
01:23:22,435 --> 01:23:24,779
You assaulted the leader.

1018
01:23:27,310 --> 01:23:34,490
I'll never forgive you for assaulting your own leader.

1019
01:23:36,669 --> 01:23:37,372
Arita

1020
01:23:38,896 --> 01:23:43,911
You didn't stop him, but you did allow him to illegally visit Ogata's sister.

1021
01:23:45,286 --> 01:23:46,536
You're just as guilty.

1022
01:23:48,388 --> 01:23:50,841
I'm court-martialing the two of you.

1023
01:23:51,474 --> 01:23:52,536
Never mind

1024
01:23:53,638 --> 01:23:55,490
Do whatever you want

1025
01:23:56,130 --> 01:23:56,958
What?

1026
01:23:58,216 --> 01:24:01,974
I'm charging you with murder.

1027
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:03,279
What?

1028
01:24:04,466 --> 01:24:05,622
Hey Iwanami

1029
01:24:06,443 --> 01:24:09,068
You killed Yagi leader

1030
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:11,943
I'm court-martialing of you.

1031
01:24:12,068 --> 01:24:13,122
Shout up!

1032
01:24:13,802 --> 01:24:16,146
Why did I kill Yagi?

1033
01:24:16,490 --> 01:24:19,208
We have a evidence

1034
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:20,536
What?

1035
01:24:22,271 --> 01:24:24,755
It's interesting.
Show me the evidence

1036
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:28,052
OK. We tell you

1037
01:24:30,943 --> 01:24:33,005
Listen carefully, you guys

1038
01:24:41,935 --> 01:24:42,911
Look at this

1039
01:24:44,529 --> 01:24:49,193
The bullet from this pistol is the one that pierced Mr. Yagi's back through his heart.

1040
01:24:50,193 --> 01:24:53,286
These are bullets from your pistol.

1041
01:24:54,599 --> 01:24:55,693
Look carefully

1042
01:24:56,521 --> 01:24:59,482
These two bullets have the same traces.

1043
01:25:00,185 --> 01:25:01,122
In short

1044
01:25:01,482 --> 01:25:04,529
Meaning they were fired from the same handgun.

1045
01:25:04,607 --> 01:25:05,607
Don't say bullshit!

1046
01:25:05,927 --> 01:25:11,060
If you hand us over to the Kempeitai, this fact will come to light.

1047
01:25:12,466 --> 01:25:15,388
It means you'll be punished, too.

1048
01:25:17,521 --> 01:25:19,240
This is interesting

1049
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:21,638
You can do whatever you want

1050
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:26,388
They are lair.
They're just trying to intimidate me.

1051
01:25:27,802 --> 01:25:29,130
What did you say?

1052
01:25:34,333 --> 01:25:35,404
What the hell

1053
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:37,271
You guys,Beat them!

1054
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:40,372
This is my order

1055
01:25:47,279 --> 01:25:48,036
Damn it!

1056
01:25:53,169 --> 01:25:54,052
Fuck you

1057
01:26:01,482 --> 01:26:02,068
Fuck you

1058
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:52,990
Stop it!

1059
01:26:57,982 --> 01:26:59,318
I'll beat him

1060
01:27:06,732 --> 01:27:08,763
I'm going to avenge Mr. Yagi.

1061
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:11,755
How's it?

1062
01:27:13,318 --> 01:27:15,115
You're not worth killing.

1063
01:27:19,505 --> 01:27:21,349
Killing you is no fun.

1064
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:26,615
I will have you tried by court-martial.

1065
01:27:31,419 --> 01:27:33,263
We are going back

1066
01:27:46,794 --> 01:27:48,052
Over there!

1067
01:27:48,115 --> 01:27:49,240
Omiya!

1068
01:27:49,265 --> 01:27:51,052
Stop it!
Don't run away!

1069
01:27:51,466 --> 01:27:52,466
Stop it!

1070
01:28:00,458 --> 01:28:02,068
Over there!

1071
01:28:24,989 --> 01:28:25,942
Damn it!

1072
01:28:38,318 --> 01:28:38,943
Shit!

1073
01:28:54,857 --> 01:28:57,161
Are you OK?
We are safe now

1074
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:01,216
You people have gotten me into a lot of trouble

1075
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:04,615
This is what we're meant to be.

1076
01:29:05,224 --> 01:29:07,740
Being in the military is the worst.

1077
01:29:32,029 --> 01:29:33,474
Take care of yourself

1078
01:29:34,114 --> 01:29:34,762
Yes

1079
01:29:36,724 --> 01:29:39,044
I'll write a letter to you later

1080
01:30:21,286 --> 01:30:23,786
Where are we going, Omiya?

1081
01:30:25,044 --> 01:30:26,138
Leave it to me

1082
01:30:29,177 --> 01:30:31,583
I'm sorry to accompany you.

1083
01:30:33,497 --> 01:30:36,255
You are really stupid

1084
01:30:43,575 --> 01:30:44,904
You're a helpless man.

1085
01:31:09,328 --> 01:31:17,703
The end

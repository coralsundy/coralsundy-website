2
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:07,555
There's no development in our relationship any more.
We're both looking out for each other's future.

3
00:01:10,298 --> 00:01:12,087
Wanna break up with me?

4
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,384
Yeah

5
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,321
You're unhappy because you can't have sex with me.

6
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:20,696
It could be

7
00:01:22,414 --> 00:01:26,406
I'm proud of myself

8
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,079
So you don't mind if we split up?

9
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:37,328
Yeah

10
00:01:39,437 --> 00:01:41,289
I'll find someone more desirable.

11
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:43,720
Okay.

12
00:01:47,994 --> 00:01:48,634
Bye.

13
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:54,653
Bye.

14
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,591
Are you alone?

15
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,091
My friend has not come yet.
Can I join in you?

16
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,497
Okay.

17
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,825
Thank you very much

18
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:26,812
You're a student?

19
00:02:28,851 --> 00:02:29,367
Yeah

20
00:02:30,125 --> 00:02:33,656
It's 11:00 in the afternoon, and your parents worries about you.

21
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,089
I don't live with them

22
00:02:38,612 --> 00:02:40,644
I see you're training to be a bride in Tokyo.

23
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:44,448
You must be popular

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,511
I'm not such a woman

25
00:02:50,763 --> 00:02:51,529
I get it

26
00:02:55,107 --> 00:03:00,013
You're simple.
All beautiful women seem to have a lot of pride.

27
00:03:06,946 --> 00:03:08,852
You must be thirsty after five games.

28
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,219
Go ahead

29
00:03:11,462 --> 00:03:13,563
I can't drink

30
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:17,524
Try a bite of it.
I'm sure you'll like it.

31
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,430
Don't force her

32
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:23,774
It's like juice.
Even people who can't drink will eat this one.

33
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,774
I'll take it then.

34
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:31,337
How is it?

35
00:03:33,501 --> 00:03:34,486
It's delicious.

36
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,376
What do you think about Vietnam?
Should the U.S. back off?

37
00:03:42,744 --> 00:03:47,244
I don't like war, but it's none of my business.

38
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:51,853
Which of these three, the U.S., the Soviet Union, or the Chinese Communist Party, should Japan choose?

39
00:03:55,641 --> 00:03:56,508
I don't know.

40
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,391
What do you do,Yasui?

41
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,337
Take a guess

42
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:07,454
I don't know.

43
00:04:08,345 --> 00:04:10,189
Oh, come on, don't be a stickler about identity.

44
00:04:11,119 --> 00:04:14,869
It's more fun for strangers to hang out with each other in a casual, fun way.

45
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,479
Yeah

46
00:04:23,991 --> 00:04:25,006
I’m sorry

47
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:31,675
She looks so nice

48
00:04:32,268 --> 00:04:36,643
It's no surprise.
I've had my eye on that girl for a month.

49
00:04:38,776 --> 00:04:39,511
Drink up.

50
00:04:39,964 --> 00:04:40,636
Thank you very much

51
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:48,440
You're as generous as ever.
As you can see, I've had nothing to do since the death of my partner.
I can barely eat.

52
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,608
The effects of adding drugs to cocktails have been seen.

53
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,163
I'll go home

54
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:47,437
I'll send you

55
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,966
What are you going to do with me?

56
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:16,886
Dai Akuto / The Great Villains (1968)

57
00:09:34,686 --> 00:09:35,483
Who?

58
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:41,061
I finally found you

59
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,397
It was hard to find here

60
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:45,834
I'm in trouble

61
00:09:46,287 --> 00:09:47,147
Please go home

62
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:51,201
Let me stay here,
We're not strangers.

63
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:53,404
Please go home

64
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:56,612
That's cold.

65
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:06,002
If you want me to leave, I'll leave.
But first, I want to show you something.

66
00:10:20,381 --> 00:10:22,920
I'm good at taking pictures, right?

67
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:26,865
Keep it as a souvenir, miss

68
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:40,200
There's more.
I've taken about three or four dozen of them.

69
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:53,145
There's no use tearing them up,
I have the negatives. I can copy hundreds of them.

70
00:10:56,683 --> 00:10:57,690
Give me the negatives.

71
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:00,376
If you don't give it to me, I'll call the police.

72
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:05,457
What do you mean, the police?
I'm a yakuza.

73
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:11,498
I asked the manager of this apartment a few questions in the guise of a marriage survey.

74
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:16,556
Your father is the principal of a famous high school in Nagano Prefecture.

75
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:22,931
He'd probably be upset if a picture like this showed up on the news.

76
00:11:25,165 --> 00:11:27,172
He, of course, then resigned as principal and retired.

77
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:29,937
Your family's going to have a hard time

78
00:11:31,288 --> 00:11:32,781
You have no filial piety.

79
00:11:37,054 --> 00:11:39,847
You go to the biggest tailoring school in Tokyo.

80
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:46,719
What do you think would happen if I walked around handing out

81
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:51,091
They'd have amazing

82
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,344
No one wanna marry you in th future

83
00:11:57,381 --> 00:11:58,174
Is that what you want?

84
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:06,104
Give me all the negatives and photos, please.

85
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,542
I'm weak when it comes to tears.

86
00:12:13,586 --> 00:12:15,392
I'll do you a favor, then.

87
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:20,484
Really?

88
00:12:22,029 --> 00:12:25,723
In exchange, I need you to do one thing for me.

89
00:12:28,764 --> 00:12:29,464
What is it?

90
00:12:46,044 --> 00:12:47,851
You are handsome

91
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,577
You are handsome

92
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:56,688
You are cool

93
00:12:59,204 --> 00:13:01,404
You are cool

94
00:13:02,137 --> 00:13:03,290
You are cool

95
00:13:10,218 --> 00:13:12,124
Pacific Recoding at 2:00 p.m.

96
00:13:12,444 --> 00:13:14,857
4:00 p.m. Taihei TV rehearsal

97
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:18,863
This will be cut off at 30 minutes
five o'clock at the film studio for airing

98
00:13:19,449 --> 00:13:22,722
Back to Far Eastern TV at 8:00
the climax of the song is in production

99
00:13:23,437 --> 00:13:26,424
9:30.
Special show at Club Candle.

100
00:13:26,449 --> 00:13:29,049
That's enough.
They're going to kill me.

101
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,468
You gotta make as much money as you can.

102
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:34,616
To make you money?

103
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:42,275
This is Akatsuki production.
Thank you very much

104
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,519
His August schedule?

105
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:46,574
He's booked solid through the fall.

106
00:13:47,387 --> 00:13:49,900
Hold on, when?

107
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,650
It's been a while.
Can I talk to you for a moment?

108
00:13:57,464 --> 00:13:58,864
I'm kind of busy today.

109
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,700
It won't take long.

110
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:05,274
Thank you for waiting. well...

111
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,964
He's too busy, sorry

112
00:14:10,876 --> 00:14:12,083
What you want?

113
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:14,690
I've got nice girl

114
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,721
Want one night?

115
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,715
I'm too busy

116
00:14:22,806 --> 00:14:24,199
You're too popular

117
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,066
No matter how much popular you make.
If you get girl into bed with you, it's a scandal.

118
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,862
I know you want sex

119
00:14:35,015 --> 00:14:35,762
Not really

120
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,026
Take a look

121
00:14:39,952 --> 00:14:44,259
She's a dressmaker's schoolgirl, a proper young lady with a proper temperament.

122
00:14:45,934 --> 00:14:47,807
You don't have to worry in the future

123
00:14:49,231 --> 00:14:50,424
It's a good shopping for you

124
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:57,535
How much is it?

125
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,110
30,000 a night.

126
00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:07,952
I don't need a girl.but I pay the pocket money for you

127
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,930
You give it to me?

128
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,490
No

129
00:15:15,003 --> 00:15:17,750
I just want us to talk about this once and for all.

130
00:15:19,781 --> 00:15:23,028
Think back to the old days.

131
00:15:24,627 --> 00:15:27,473
You're an unknown, but we brought you up and made you a star.

132
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:29,882
I haven't forgotten.

133
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:37,762
I've handled your show many times.
I've taken care of the girls, but I don't remember giving you any trouble.

134
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:40,762
I feel guilty

135
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,332
But the police have banned gangsters from the entertainment business.

136
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:50,804
You'll still make your money.

137
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,885
but my gang's broken up and we're all on the street.

138
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,176
I feel sorry for you

139
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:59,068
So I figured out what to do with myself.

140
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,133
No matter what I try, it doesn't work.

141
00:16:07,719 --> 00:16:10,259
I got into this business because I had no choice.

142
00:16:10,772 --> 00:16:13,429
Please help me

143
00:16:14,334 --> 00:16:15,554
I'm in trouble

144
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:19,004
This map, apartment number 603.

145
00:16:20,494 --> 00:16:24,827
You push the button, this girl comes out, you give her the money.

146
00:16:26,463 --> 00:16:29,343
This is just business

147
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:32,697
Let's not treat me like beggars.

148
00:16:43,353 --> 00:16:49,877
We've got a deal.
Tonight at 10:00 p.m., you're gonna come into my apartment, and I'm gonna give you the keys to my room.

149
00:16:50,284 --> 00:16:51,570
I'm staying at a hotel.

150
00:16:52,229 --> 00:16:53,056
What can I get you?

151
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:54,082
Coffee

152
00:17:02,305 --> 00:17:04,812
What's the matter with you?

153
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:12,890
If I go out with this guy just once tonight, you gonna give me the pictures and the negatives?

154
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,713
Yeah

155
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:17,146
When do I get it?

156
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,241
As soon as this is over.

157
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,450
You sure?

158
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:26,519
You insist.
You're dealing with a popular star

159
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:29,154
He's popular among women

160
00:17:30,418 --> 00:17:32,005
You may be lucky

161
00:17:34,605 --> 00:17:36,439
I'm not one of those women.

162
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:40,854
Well, you just have to be patient, 'cause it's gonna be a little bit of a bad dream.

163
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,904
You're a real lady.

164
00:18:26,143 --> 00:18:27,950
I'm sure 30,000 yen won't be too much for you.

165
00:18:30,487 --> 00:18:34,647
Come on, let's go to bed, we don't have time for this.

166
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:49,481
Come on, let's get you into bed.

167
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:54,061
Turn off the light, please.

168
00:18:56,335 --> 00:18:59,315
I'm paying you.
Let me do what I want.

169
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:01,101
I don't want

170
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:02,808
What are you talking about?

171
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:07,741
I like the light better.

172
00:19:47,001 --> 00:19:48,214
I like you

173
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:50,487


174
00:19:52,664 --> 00:19:54,317
You can't do that

175
00:19:55,424 --> 00:19:56,777
Yasui, what's that?

176
00:19:57,692 --> 00:19:58,218
This?

177
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:06,755
Stop it....

178
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:08,788
Stop it....

179
00:20:10,772 --> 00:20:13,638
I filmed good

180
00:20:14,305 --> 00:20:15,798
What are you going to do with it?

181
00:20:16,199 --> 00:20:18,466
I'll think about it when I see how it's used and how well it's done.

182
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:21,003
You tricked me.

183
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:29,431
Don't get violent.
If you get hurt, it's bad for business.

184
00:20:30,055 --> 00:20:32,328
How much can I pay for the film?

185
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,730
We can deal it later

186
00:20:36,282 --> 00:20:39,742
Your job is over, okay?

187
00:20:57,795 --> 00:21:01,221
I'll give you the exact negatives of the nude photos as promised.

188
00:21:02,686 --> 00:21:05,533
Burn them, bury them, do whatever you want with them.

189
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:19,617
What happens to the film I just shot?

190
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,738
I don't remember saying I'd give it to you.

191
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,764
And now you're blackmailing me again.

192
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,641
Yeah

193
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:32,312
After all, this one has a real bed scene with a guy.

194
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,378
It's a brand-new black-and-white film.

195
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:41,153
Compared to the intensity of that.
What's the point of these nude pictures?

196
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:44,162
That was the plan all along, wasn't it?

197
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:48,279
It's not easy to let go of a woman once you've had your eye on her.

198
00:21:49,567 --> 00:21:51,481
As long as I have this film, you're screwed.

199
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,002
I bet your father and mother would have cried if they saw this.

200
00:21:56,194 --> 00:21:59,121
They will be like  I didn't raise her to be such a shameless bitch.

201
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,003
Where are you going?

202
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,577
I'm going

203
00:22:12,637 --> 00:22:13,964
You're staying here tonight.

204
00:22:14,024 --> 00:22:14,537
No

205
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:19,621
You don't mind if I send this film around to your home and your school?

206
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:24,082
If you don't like it, stay here and be quiet

207
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:28,864
Stay down, you are mine now

208
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,954
I made a promise on the phone earlier.

209
00:23:11,927 --> 00:23:13,060
One moment, please, sir.

210
00:23:17,594 --> 00:23:19,494
You have a visitor.

211
00:23:20,143 --> 00:23:21,563
Get them here

212
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,927
Are you Teruo Shima?

213
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,227
No

214
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:28,344
You are

215
00:23:30,182 --> 00:23:32,536
You can go home now... and get ready for school.

216
00:23:33,342 --> 00:23:34,956
But I have class at 6:00 p.m., right?

217
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:36,622
Go somewhere till then

218
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:47,975
Anyway, we're up against Yakuza,

219
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:51,278
We're a popular businessman with a lot of weaknesses.

220
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:58,375
I'm sure they'll come up with a big payday sooner or later.
I can't just do what they want.

221
00:23:58,703 --> 00:23:59,929
I don't know what to do.

222
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:05,030
It's your fault.
There's nothing I can do about it.

223
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:09,375
Please don't do that and help me somehow.

224
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:13,501
I know you are specialist about this kind of case

225
00:24:14,888 --> 00:24:18,522
Am I specialist  lawyer for Yakuza?

226
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,241
I don't mean that

227
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:26,551
I'm a bad lawyer with a bill of goods, according to the judges and prosecutors.

228
00:24:27,543 --> 00:24:30,016
Do you have any good idea?

229
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:36,115
The quickest way to get out of this is to charge them with extortion.

230
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:40,265
Don't do that.
What if people know about this

231
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:45,703
You'd be locked out of TV.
Your popularity will plummet.

232
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,793
You're the only one I can count on.

233
00:24:50,552 --> 00:24:54,179
I'll leave everything to you.
I'm counting on you.

234
00:24:55,324 --> 00:24:57,084
I hate yakuzas.

235
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,450
I'd be happy to take you in, but it's going to cost you a lot of money.

236
00:25:02,956 --> 00:25:05,476
Of course, I'm prepared to pay for it.

237
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:08,266
What is my fee?

238
00:25:09,792 --> 00:25:12,946
How much you need?

239
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,033
million

240
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:21,086
No way,I'm not going to ask for you if I'm going to pay that much money.

241
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:22,528
So I decline

242
00:25:24,485 --> 00:25:26,752
I'm not really into this

243
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,645
I get it. There's no choice

244
00:25:32,882 --> 00:25:36,275
We'll pay million

245
00:25:36,602 --> 00:25:39,415
In exchange, please settle the matter so there'll be no trouble

246
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:12,290
What are you doing?

247
00:26:13,557 --> 00:26:14,790
Give me the film

248
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:17,243
Please

249
00:26:18,943 --> 00:26:20,003
Where is it?

250
00:26:20,028 --> 00:26:20,843
Damn it

251
00:26:24,992 --> 00:26:26,245
You won't give me?

252
00:26:26,452 --> 00:26:27,138
Of course

253
00:26:27,992 --> 00:26:30,572
That was a money-making scheme.
I'm not giving it to you.

254
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,492
Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

255
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:42,795
You don't mind if I spread the porno film around?

256
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:45,919
I don't mind

257
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:49,309
I'm ready for it.

258
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:52,969
I don't care what they do to me.

259
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:59,593
I don't care if I can't have a proper marriage, or what people say about me.

260
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:02,665
But

261
00:27:06,928 --> 00:27:08,475
I don't want to live with yo

262
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:14,034
 I don't want to see your face .
I don't care if you kill you.

263
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:21,984
Well, then, I'll kill you, as you wish.

264
00:27:54,146 --> 00:27:55,266
Don't fuck with me.

265
00:27:56,536 --> 00:27:58,463
Don't talk big if you don't want to get hurt.

266
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,616
You can't leave the room like this.

267
00:28:18,215 --> 00:28:19,329
Stay down

268
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:35,876
Are you Yasui?

269
00:28:36,522 --> 00:28:37,289
who?

270
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:40,489
I represent Teruo shima.

271
00:28:42,621 --> 00:28:43,488
You're a lawyer?

272
00:28:43,768 --> 00:28:44,841
I'm sorry to bother you.

273
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:50,685
Here's good place

274
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:53,242
How did you get it?

275
00:28:54,038 --> 00:28:56,978
Did you extort her to collect on a bad debt?

276
00:28:57,805 --> 00:28:58,738
What can I do for you?

277
00:28:59,678 --> 00:29:00,291
Yasui?

278
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:04,943
The girl who slept with Teruo was a businesswoman you hired?

279
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:12,669
Just because a popular singer hooks up with a professional woman doesn't make him a scandal nowadays.

280
00:29:14,277 --> 00:29:15,290
Don't say bullshit

281
00:29:16,656 --> 00:29:18,889
He slept with my wife

282
00:29:20,288 --> 00:29:23,028
He is the star. The world won't forgive him for messing around with other people's wives.

283
00:29:23,354 --> 00:29:24,227
Your wife?

284
00:29:25,206 --> 00:29:27,506
She's here now

285
00:29:28,373 --> 00:29:29,246
She's sleeping there

286
00:29:30,285 --> 00:29:31,858
He's depression about Teruo

287
00:29:32,885 --> 00:29:33,831
You sure?

288
00:29:35,258 --> 00:29:35,998
Come

289
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:48,068
He's lawyers, so whatever he ask you, don't answer.

290
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,067
This is my wife.

291
00:29:53,761 --> 00:29:55,514
See if she's a businesswoman.

292
00:30:02,074 --> 00:30:02,814
I see.

293
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:07,578
Wife, I'm Tokuda

294
00:30:08,921 --> 00:30:11,994
I'll be visiting from time to time to represent Mr. Shima.

295
00:30:12,541 --> 00:30:13,294
Thanks

296
00:30:14,795 --> 00:30:18,229
By the way, let's take a look at the film

297
00:30:18,904 --> 00:30:21,084
What are you going to do with a film?

298
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:24,212
I can't give you a price without seeing the film.

299
00:30:25,335 --> 00:30:26,729
I'm the one who sets the prices.

300
00:30:27,501 --> 00:30:28,974
You ask to Shima

301
00:30:29,514 --> 00:30:30,328
No way

302
00:30:31,758 --> 00:30:34,084
I'm lawyer,I'm not at your mercy.

303
00:30:36,644 --> 00:30:37,850
Let me show you.

304
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:57,025
Wife,This is your commercial photo?

305
00:31:02,473 --> 00:31:04,973
If you have any problems...
Come here anytime.

306
00:31:08,403 --> 00:31:09,490
We'll be happy to help you.

307
00:31:29,446 --> 00:31:31,540
Interesting, isn't it?
How much do you want for it?

308
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,438
This is rubbish

309
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:39,126
this film is worthless

310
00:31:41,063 --> 00:31:42,610
I can't pay a penny.

311
00:31:43,454 --> 00:31:44,688
Are you sure?

312
00:31:45,548 --> 00:31:50,899
Now that I'm on board.
I'm not paying you a dime.

313
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:55,743
That's bull.
How can you work as an agent if you destroy the story?

314
00:31:58,409 --> 00:31:59,284
Yasui

315
00:32:00,831 --> 00:32:03,183
If you think you can blackmail people with pornographic photos, you're wrong.

316
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:06,464
The world is not that easy nowadays.

317
00:32:07,949 --> 00:32:08,581
You think so?

318
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,300
I don't care how big a mouth you have.
This film exists.

319
00:32:15,488 --> 00:32:20,019
You can make or break TERUO SHIMA.
It's up to you to decide how to handle it.

320
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:25,925
But in my hands...
I can free him from your hands without paying a penny

321
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,773
After all, I'm the man who can do the impossible.

322
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:33,406
Don't be lair

323
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:35,742
Don't be sorry.

324
00:32:37,711 --> 00:32:39,547
You'd be safer if you didn't make such a fuss.

325
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:45,516
You make a move, you'll be strangling yourself.
I'll do it.

326
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,173
Mr. Yasui

327
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:07,688
What can I do for you?

328
00:33:08,532 --> 00:33:10,063
I have something urgent to tell him

329
00:33:10,423 --> 00:33:12,407
He's busy, I will listen

330
00:33:15,466 --> 00:33:18,560
Give me a call.
I'd visited you

331
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:22,575
I'm a yakuza. I'm in a TV studio. Is that a problem?

332
00:33:23,544 --> 00:33:25,896
This is his important TV studio.

333
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,786
So please

334
00:33:29,122 --> 00:33:31,771
If you don't want me to come, don't send some strange lawyer.

335
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,214
We can't deal with

336
00:33:36,339 --> 00:33:41,433
That's outrageous.
We wanted to reach an amicable settlement, so we asked Mr. Tokuda.

337
00:33:43,518 --> 00:33:44,862
Then let's get rid of him.

338
00:33:45,448 --> 00:33:46,714
He's being rude?

339
00:33:48,885 --> 00:33:55,315
He's an asshole.
It's going to get more and more troublesome.

340
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:04,940
Tokuda Law Office.

341
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:06,651
Yes he is here

342
00:35:07,534 --> 00:35:09,432
there's a call

343
00:35:11,183 --> 00:35:11,690
You

344
00:35:13,987 --> 00:35:15,417
Please buy me some cigarettes

345
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,948
About what you asked me the other day.
Actually, things have changed a bit.

346
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:25,143
We'd like you to withdraw from the case.

347
00:35:25,518 --> 00:35:26,808
I'm in trouble

348
00:35:28,528 --> 00:35:32,715
I'm a firm believer that once I take on a case, I stick with it until the end.

349
00:35:33,246 --> 00:35:34,949
I don't take orders from clients.

350
00:35:36,949 --> 00:35:42,309
Maybe Yasui threatened you
I'm not a coward who stays at the Yakuza and backs down.

351
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:47,028
Anyway, can we please forget about the other day?
I'm begging you.

352
00:35:47,403 --> 00:35:53,106
If you insist.
I'll tell the reporter about the incident in the paper.

353
00:35:54,586 --> 00:35:56,195
They'd be happy to publish

354
00:35:56,851 --> 00:35:57,609
No way

355
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,625
Then shut up and watch.

356
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:08,731
Wife

357
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:11,871
You're very well dressed,

358
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:19,028
I ran out to see if you could help me.

359
00:36:20,192 --> 00:36:21,918
Lend me some money for taxi

360
00:36:22,567 --> 00:36:23,895
I'll go to pay

361
00:36:25,342 --> 00:36:28,405
Did anyone see you enter this room?

362
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:30,772
No, sir.

363
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:36,006
Hide here.
You don't want to be seen.

364
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:43,755
Cigarettes.

365
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,192
You can go home today.

366
00:36:56,902 --> 00:36:59,769
I see.
I see what you mean.

367
00:37:01,464 --> 00:37:02,292
I get it

368
00:37:03,011 --> 00:37:06,644
Lawyer makes the impossible possible.

369
00:37:07,378 --> 00:37:10,854
You said you can't blackmail people with funny pictures

370
00:37:12,656 --> 00:37:15,414
Please help me

371
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,242
I was lying

372
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:24,344
If I show weakness to the Yakuza, they will take advantage of me.
I was just trying to scare him

373
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,508
I'm not so sure.

374
00:37:27,484 --> 00:37:30,945
Can't beat Yasui?
No, you can't.

375
00:37:33,249 --> 00:37:33,945
Please

376
00:37:35,741 --> 00:37:36,413
No thanks

377
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:47,332
Then take me to the police.

378
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:54,774
If I tell the detectives everything,they'll arrest him.

379
00:37:55,766 --> 00:38:02,399
But for a charge of kidnapping and assaulting a woman, he'll be out in a couple of years.

380
00:38:04,852 --> 00:38:08,086
Generally speaking. Yakuza are vindictive and bored.

381
00:38:09,695 --> 00:38:14,289
Wherever you're hiding, they'll find you and pay you back.

382
00:38:16,016 --> 00:38:17,828
You'll suffer worse than you do now.

383
00:38:19,016 --> 00:38:21,695
What should I do?

384
00:38:22,047 --> 00:38:23,695
You'll be in trouble

385
00:38:24,984 --> 00:38:29,867
You become a prostitute and end up dying of disease.

386
00:38:31,521 --> 00:38:35,740
Or commit suicide or be admitted to a mental hospital.

387
00:38:37,529 --> 00:38:39,662
You'll never survive.

388
00:38:46,065 --> 00:38:49,167
What should I do?

389
00:38:51,214 --> 00:38:53,901
you may be saved

390
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,518
What way?

391
00:38:58,628 --> 00:38:59,933
If Yasui is dead

392
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:05,362
he die from an illness or from a traffic accident

393
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:13,937
If I wait for such a coincidence, I'll become a grandmother.

394
00:39:14,945 --> 00:39:16,210
You should be more serious

395
00:39:17,804 --> 00:39:21,234
Do you think you'll live long by Yasui's side?

396
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:29,656
So I can't be saved

397
00:39:31,425 --> 00:39:37,557
Anyway, you and Yasui are the only ones who can survive.

398
00:39:39,542 --> 00:39:40,855
Be brave.

399
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,129
Be brave?

400
00:39:46,121 --> 00:39:47,411
he's crazy

401
00:39:49,176 --> 00:39:52,762
You'd better throw him in the nuthouse or You should kill him

402
00:39:55,466 --> 00:39:58,381
You're asking me to kill him?

403
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:02,052
Life is a battle.

404
00:40:03,412 --> 00:40:04,349
Killing each other.

405
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:09,521
Every human being has the right to resist.

406
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,353
But if I kill him...

407
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:21,931
I'll be murder

408
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:25,767
Killing someone doesn't make you a murderer.

409
00:40:27,649 --> 00:40:30,071
In my five years of experience as a lawyer

410
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:35,728
Yakuza bosses and politicians never go to jail.

411
00:40:39,446 --> 00:40:43,227
That's rare.
We should have a visitor by now.

412
00:40:52,595 --> 00:40:54,220
I know Yoshiko is here

413
00:40:54,579 --> 00:40:55,102
Yeah

414
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,595
She's in the back room.

415
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,766
So this is it.
You took her out?

416
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:04,354
She jumped in from the other side.

417
00:41:06,283 --> 00:41:09,346
You're bad husband,
I can't believe your wife ran away

418
00:41:09,612 --> 00:41:11,823
What did you teach her?

419
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:14,323
Nothing

420
00:41:16,268 --> 00:41:18,002
I'm just telling her what happened

421
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:22,807
I was just trying to be sympathetic and comforting her

422
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,057
You slept with her?

423
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:26,041
No way

424
00:41:26,932 --> 00:41:29,737
I'm not playboy

425
00:41:31,166 --> 00:41:32,026
Lawyer.

426
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,080
Get off this case before you get hurt.

427
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:38,791
I'll think about it.

428
00:41:46,503 --> 00:41:48,191
Are you drinking?

429
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:56,501
Yoshiko, if you don't want me to kill you, go back

430
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,806
Wear this

431
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:03,976
Don't pick on her.

432
00:42:04,672 --> 00:42:06,078
She's my girl.Shut up

433
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:37,235
You made me shame

434
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:40,140
Why did you meet him?

435
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:53,188
Did you sleep with him?
How was it?

436
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,141
He didn't do anything. not like you

437
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:06,347
I'll ask your body

438
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,910
Bear in mind, don't sleep with anyone without asking me

439
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:41,474
Stop it....

440
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,653
I'm not?

441
00:43:50,665 --> 00:43:51,392
no

442
00:43:52,876 --> 00:43:55,322
I'm on period today

443
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,408
i don't believe it

444
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,322
Stop it....

445
00:44:24,341 --> 00:44:28,005
Yoshiko,You're my girl

446
00:44:29,739 --> 00:44:33,879
You can't leave from me

447
00:44:40,331 --> 00:44:42,206
You'll be making money for me until the day you die.

448
00:44:44,026 --> 00:44:45,292
I choose clients.

449
00:44:49,143 --> 00:44:53,455
permission...
I'll kill you

450
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:55,729
You understand?

451
00:48:20,607 --> 00:48:21,373
Hello?

452
00:48:24,482 --> 00:48:27,388
This is Yoshiko

453
00:48:28,006 --> 00:48:30,146
What's wrong?

454
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:35,242
I killed him.

455
00:48:35,492 --> 00:48:37,914
I'll be right there.

456
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:42,123
You made it

457
00:49:43,349 --> 00:49:47,662
But how did you manage to kill him with those skinny arms?

458
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:53,804
Because he was sleeping off his whiskey.
I was preoccupied.

459
00:49:56,054 --> 00:49:58,225
What am I supposed to do?

460
00:49:59,007 --> 00:50:03,077
You killed a man.
You're going to turn yourself in to the police.

461
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:10,663
You said
Killing someone doesn't make you a murderer.

462
00:50:12,670 --> 00:50:15,569
Murder's not that big a deal in a case like this.

463
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:20,342
You'll get five years and probation.

464
00:50:24,637 --> 00:50:30,536
If you don't want to do that either, why don't you cross one dangerous bridge and try to win?

465
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,552
It's more fun for me.

466
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:35,677
What do you mean by that?

467
00:50:36,974 --> 00:50:38,403
I'll get you acquitted.

468
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:43,504
Anyway, as soon as I get back, you get on the phone and call Police.

469
00:50:47,551 --> 00:50:49,801
You're leaving me alone?

470
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,660
If they find out we're related, you're not gonna make it.

471
00:50:54,598 --> 00:50:59,684
When you go to the police, they'll make sure you get a lawyer.
That's the first time you mention my name.

472
00:51:00,997 --> 00:51:02,262
I'll be there

473
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:04,364
Then?

474
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:07,161
All you have to do is follow my lead.

475
00:51:15,915 --> 00:51:16,892
This is?

476
00:51:20,196 --> 00:51:21,329
Well

477
00:51:23,791 --> 00:51:25,315
the murder weapon was a necktie.

478
00:51:26,651 --> 00:51:28,736
You used two?

479
00:51:30,651 --> 00:51:33,002
First one I used was broken

480
00:51:41,236 --> 00:51:42,001
Oh, this.

481
00:52:22,719 --> 00:52:27,031
Now you're free at last, aren't you?

482
00:52:28,547 --> 00:52:31,203
Let's drink a toast while looking at Yasui's corpse.

483
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:34,250
Come here and give me a drink

484
00:52:36,844 --> 00:52:38,149
Don't say bullshit

485
00:52:38,508 --> 00:52:39,352
I'm serious

486
00:52:40,485 --> 00:52:42,016
We don't have time

487
00:52:43,446 --> 00:52:45,657
Hurry up

488
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,235
You drink too

489
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,219
I can't

490
00:53:12,712 --> 00:53:14,758
If you don't want to be a murderer, drink.

491
00:53:18,073 --> 00:53:20,550
Let's drink a lot

492
00:53:44,878 --> 00:53:46,199
You got scar

493
00:53:48,847 --> 00:53:51,152
Why did you chock me?

494
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:54,550
Next get naked

495
00:53:57,113 --> 00:53:58,003
For what?

496
00:53:58,496 --> 00:53:59,457
To get acquitted.

497
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:03,441
We've got a lot of work to do before we call the police.

498
00:54:05,468 --> 00:54:07,296
If you want to save your life, you're gonna have to drink it.

499
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,109
I can trust you, can't I?

500
00:54:13,222 --> 00:54:14,097
Hurry up

501
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:18,175
I do

502
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:27,740
I make him naked too

503
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:01,803
Your mom has visited you

504
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:05,061
She came to Tokyo from Nagano last night.

505
00:55:06,733 --> 00:55:12,045
Yoshiko, you've done a terrible thing.

506
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:17,780
Why did you go with a yakuza guy?

507
00:55:19,389 --> 00:55:20,936
I had no choice.

508
00:55:22,428 --> 00:55:24,194
Because you had an opening.

509
00:55:25,257 --> 00:55:28,225
You've always been a little strange

510
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:34,983
Lawyer, please help her

511
00:55:35,475 --> 00:55:36,405
I will

512
00:55:36,944 --> 00:55:40,319
When can I get released from here?

513
00:55:41,602 --> 00:55:45,891
The prosecutor accuses me every day and it's very painful.

514
00:55:46,078 --> 00:55:48,821
Soon.
Please hang in there!

515
00:56:10,003 --> 00:56:12,526
I need five copies of this case and five copies of this case.

516
00:56:17,709 --> 00:56:19,029
You must be prosecutor Okano.

517
00:56:21,217 --> 00:56:23,639
I understand you'll be handling the second half of Yoshiko Ota's case.

518
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:28,326
I'm defense counsel, Mr. Tokuda.
Pleased to meet you.

519
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:35,843
I've heard a lot about you.
Are you going to try something again?

520
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,914
Of course not.
I can't help you with this one.

521
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:42,515
The defendant confessed to the murder.

522
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:45,414
Confession is the king of evidence.

523
00:56:46,234 --> 00:56:49,648
For my part, I have no choice but to rely on the sympathies of the procutor.

524
00:56:49,796 --> 00:56:50,812
What can I do for you?

525
00:56:52,023 --> 00:56:56,608
The defendant's bail, if you could please let her out.

526
00:56:58,117 --> 00:57:00,109
Not until after the first trial.

527
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:21,489
What time did the victim YASUI come back to the apartment on the day of the dimension?

528
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:30,339
I believe it was around 8:30 p.m.

529
00:57:31,245 --> 00:57:32,753
What was the defendant doing?

530
00:57:34,706 --> 00:57:39,565
I was on period that day

531
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:44,589
My head was heavy and I felt very bad.

532
00:57:46,386 --> 00:57:50,785
I was in a daze when Yasui said...

533
00:57:51,988 --> 00:57:52,902
What he said?

534
00:57:54,331 --> 00:57:59,526
You're wasting time. Get a client.

535
00:58:01,044 --> 00:58:03,926
I told him I couldn't do it today.

536
00:58:05,926 --> 00:58:08,997
He hit and kicked me

537
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:11,676
I thought he was going to kill me.

538
00:58:13,012 --> 00:58:13,723
Then?

539
00:58:15,872 --> 00:58:21,520
And then, just then, that man came in.

540
00:58:22,192 --> 00:58:24,216
Who was he, and what did he look like?

541
00:58:26,864 --> 00:58:29,333
I don't remember.

542
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,777
Yes, he had been hit pretty hard with a band and he was out cold.

543
00:58:45,449 --> 00:58:51,902
And he was wearing a white mask and sunglasses.

544
00:58:54,090 --> 00:59:00,707
Yasui called him "bro".

545
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:03,613
What was he doing here?

546
00:59:06,871 --> 00:59:09,824
I didn't get a good look at him.

547
00:59:12,362 --> 00:59:15,940
I think he hit Yasui out of the blue.

548
00:59:18,018 --> 00:59:19,073
Why he hit him?

549
00:59:23,221 --> 00:59:29,393
He was kind of angry.
He looked like he was going to kill Yasui.

550
00:59:50,495 --> 00:59:53,433
Yasui just kept apologizing

551
00:59:54,527 --> 01:00:00,571
Finally he got into a good mood,They started drinking whiskey together.

552
01:00:03,298 --> 01:00:06,455
When he was drinking
Did the man take off his facial mask?

553
01:00:07,853 --> 01:00:14,103
No, he didn't.
No. He pulled it up a little and poured it into his mouth.

554
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:16,702
That's funny.

555
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:24,944
He said he was wanted by the police and he didn't want anyone to see his face.

556
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,716
Yasui said softly

557
01:00:29,341 --> 01:00:30,958
What did you do after that?

558
01:00:31,747 --> 01:00:35,943
He asked me He asked me to pour him a drink.

559
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:55,429
When I had no choice, he asked me to drink too.

560
01:00:57,832 --> 01:00:58,801
When I refused, Yasui said

561
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:04,082
Yasui said, "Are you disobeying my brother's order? and forced me drink

562
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:29,691
I was in so much pain.

563
01:01:31,144 --> 01:01:36,621
They made me drink so many drinks
I didn't know what was going on.

564
01:01:38,686 --> 01:01:49,617
Then, he told me that drinking alone was boring.
He told me to try something different.

565
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:51,227
What was that?

566
01:02:00,837 --> 01:02:09,298
He told me and Yasui to get naked and demonstrate by hugging each other in front of me.

567
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,228
And what did the defendant do?

568
01:02:15,908 --> 01:02:19,712
I didn't think it was possible.

569
01:02:20,736 --> 01:02:33,102
Yasui told me that my bro had always been a man who would make me do anything he said, even kill me, and that there was no use in resisting him.

570
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,782
So you did it?

571
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:02,591
Yes

572
01:03:04,575 --> 01:03:06,849
He forced me

573
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:12,309
I was embarrassed.

574
01:03:23,187 --> 01:03:24,554
Carry on

575
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:38,623
The man was getting more and more amused, and he even told me what to do with Yasui.

576
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:43,696
He made me do things I couldn't say out loud.

577
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:55,938
When Yasui was on the bottom and I was on top, the man said again

578
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:59,548
It's no fun to just hug each other!

579
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:03,938
He told us both to close our necks around each other.

580
01:04:05,298 --> 01:04:08,352
He made Yasui pick up his tie.

581
01:04:10,602 --> 01:04:12,587
Why did he make you do that?

582
01:04:13,727 --> 01:04:19,813
He said that choking each other would make both the man and the woman feel much better

583
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,765
You made it?

584
01:04:24,305 --> 01:04:35,235
He said it would make BRO happy.
I strangled him with his tie.

585
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:02,605
Yasui also tightened his grip on my throat.

586
01:05:05,115 --> 01:05:11,568
When I looked at his face, it wasn't human at all, it looked like a hideous creature.

587
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:20,396
I couldn't hold back any longer and squeezed is his neck as hard as I could.

588
01:05:23,157 --> 01:05:29,413
I was so tight that I couldn't breathe.

589
01:05:31,446 --> 01:05:33,253
I got passed out

590
01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,441
And then what happened?

591
01:05:38,697 --> 01:05:46,582
When I came to my senses...
I found the masked man was gone and Yasui was lying there naked.

592
01:05:48,959 --> 01:05:54,105
I wondered if he fell asleep, but his body was as cold as ice.

593
01:05:54,793 --> 01:05:57,080
That's when you realized that Yasui was dead?

594
01:05:59,333 --> 01:05:59,713
yes

595
01:06:02,035 --> 01:06:07,674
Suddenly I got scared and called the police right away.

596
01:06:09,656 --> 01:06:16,244
you said you  lost patience when you  put on his necktie.
In other words,you  intended to kill Yasui?

597
01:06:16,503 --> 01:06:20,800
Significant.
It's an interrogation.I ask you to withdraw it.

598
01:06:21,486 --> 01:06:24,133
Why don't you change the question?

599
01:06:27,069 --> 01:06:29,529
How did you feel?

600
01:06:30,846 --> 01:06:34,186
Was it because you were sexually aroused?

601
01:06:35,216 --> 01:06:36,729
Or did you intend to kill him?

602
01:06:36,988 --> 01:06:42,395
I couldn't take it anymore.

603
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:45,074
I'd wanted to kill him

604
01:06:47,090 --> 01:06:49,044
Who wouldn't want to be humiliated like that?

605
01:06:52,784 --> 01:06:56,911
I'm a woman.
I'm a human being.

606
01:07:02,404 --> 01:07:04,337
This is the tie you wore around Yasui's neck, isn't it?

607
01:07:07,632 --> 01:07:10,319
Yes, I believe so.

608
01:07:11,411 --> 01:07:12,818
We're done

609
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:15,165
Do you have a cross-examination?

610
01:07:18,444 --> 01:07:19,004
No

611
01:07:21,859 --> 01:07:22,633
Yoshiko

612
01:07:24,992 --> 01:07:26,932
I'll go back to Nagano

613
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:34,135
I've been sitting in on the trial the whole time.
I'm so embarrassed and ashamed.

614
01:07:35,395 --> 01:07:37,321
I can't stand living in Tokyo

615
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:54,703
Even if I go back to my country, I'll never get out.You'll resign and we'll all go into the mountains and live in secret

616
01:07:58,961 --> 01:08:00,755
This is all your fault.

617
01:08:04,428 --> 01:08:05,228
I'm sorry.

618
01:08:09,388 --> 01:08:10,821
I won't see you anymore

619
01:08:15,628 --> 01:08:16,535
See you

620
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:38,306
I'm finally alone.

621
01:08:40,488 --> 01:08:46,055
We don't need a society or a family to survive.

622
01:08:48,108 --> 01:08:49,528
I did that

623
01:08:51,361 --> 01:08:52,454
I'm a woman.

624
01:08:53,645 --> 01:08:54,811
I wouldn't dare.

625
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:57,285
Don't worry, I'm here.

626
01:08:59,072 --> 01:09:03,259
By the way, that was a very good courtroom act.

627
01:09:04,437 --> 01:09:09,424
But if I don't, I'm a murderer.

628
01:09:09,874 --> 01:09:14,120
Don't worry.
Once we get him to trial, he's all ours.

629
01:09:15,822 --> 01:09:16,448
Why?

630
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:26,825
Cops are hard to fool, but judges and prosecutors are easy.
They all look like pretending great but

631
01:09:27,473 --> 01:09:32,120
They don't know the world, they don't know women, and they have a weakness for beautiful women like you.

632
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:35,754
I don't believe it.

633
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,920
Besides, the defendant confessed in this case.

634
01:09:41,834 --> 01:09:44,294
They must feel comfortable cutting corners.

635
01:09:45,871 --> 01:09:47,644
This will be the key we will win

636
01:09:49,828 --> 01:09:54,101
You're really going to save my life, aren't you?

637
01:09:56,563 --> 01:10:01,896
Trials are fun.
The prosecution's case is closed today.

638
01:10:03,429 --> 01:10:04,882
Now it's time to get to work.

639
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:13,523
Mr.Yasui, is the room still the same as it was at the time of the incident?

640
01:10:13,797 --> 01:10:14,463
Yeah

641
01:10:14,896 --> 01:10:16,223
He bought here

642
01:10:16,718 --> 01:10:21,531
Actually, we'd like to reexamine the crime scene.
I was wondering if you'd be willing to come down and take a look at the crime scene?

643
01:10:21,812 --> 01:10:22,725
reexamine?

644
01:10:23,423 --> 01:10:25,856
No worries, it will finish soon

645
01:10:36,279 --> 01:10:38,926
Moldy. You haven't changed at all since then.

646
01:10:39,283 --> 01:10:40,750
That's good for me

647
01:11:13,473 --> 01:11:16,666
Something's wrong with this tie.

648
01:11:18,296 --> 01:11:18,963
It's cut.

649
01:11:26,223 --> 01:11:30,623
Do you know this defendant?

650
01:11:31,336 --> 01:11:31,730
Yes, I do.

651
01:11:32,916 --> 01:11:34,189
What is your relationship to her?

652
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:40,331
I met her a few times in Tokyo because we are from Nagano Prefecture, but we are not close enough to have a relationship.

653
01:11:42,211 --> 01:11:42,998
I see.

654
01:11:46,012 --> 01:11:49,572
By the way, does the defendant drink?

655
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:56,052
One sip of beer and her face turned red and she was in agony.

656
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:03,777
You've seen this tie before?

657
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:04,827
Yes

658
01:12:05,980 --> 01:12:06,727
Where did you see this?

659
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:08,420
In Mr. Yasui's room.

660
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:13,198
The lawyer found it in the wardrobe and showed it to me.

661
01:12:15,522 --> 01:12:16,416
That's enough

662
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:19,412
Prosecutor, cross-examine the witness.

663
01:12:22,824 --> 01:12:23,631
I don't have

664
01:12:25,219 --> 01:12:31,906
The defendant was severely intoxicated when he tied Yasui's neck with his tie?

665
01:12:33,503 --> 01:12:33,983
Yes

666
01:12:34,964 --> 01:12:41,784
You can't drink at all.
How did you feel when he forced you to drink whiskey?

667
01:12:43,549 --> 01:12:47,156
I was dying

668
01:12:48,577 --> 01:12:54,263
Were you in a position to clearly remember the pattern and color of the tie you were wearing Yasui?

669
01:12:54,706 --> 01:12:55,380
No

670
01:12:57,552 --> 01:13:06,927
And I was so embarrassed that my head was spinning and my eyes were blurry.

671
01:13:07,762 --> 01:13:10,975
Then you must have been mistaken, or misremembered.

672
01:13:11,355 --> 01:13:12,695
That's Leading questions.

673
01:13:14,361 --> 01:13:16,647
Counsel, would you like to change the question?

674
01:13:17,227 --> 01:13:17,587
Yes

675
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:30,745
Here are two ties.

676
01:13:31,884 --> 01:13:37,444
One was submitted by the prosecutor as the murder weapon.
The other two were newly discovered by me.

677
01:13:39,223 --> 01:13:44,789
Which did you use to strangle Yasui?

678
01:13:46,426 --> 01:13:47,306
Well...

679
01:13:48,259 --> 01:13:49,159
Take a look at these

680
01:13:55,513 --> 01:13:58,133
I remember... this

681
01:13:58,646 --> 01:14:00,259
Why do you think so?

682
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:10,820
When I strangled Yasui When he strangled Yasui, there was a cracking sound and the tie broke.

683
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,313
The color and pattern were like this.

684
01:14:18,509 --> 01:14:24,528
So you didn't use this one submitted by the prosecutor?

685
01:14:27,393 --> 01:14:27,673
No

686
01:14:28,753 --> 01:14:32,940
Why did you admit to having done this until now?

687
01:14:35,298 --> 01:14:46,899
When the police showed me this, I thought I'd killed someone.
I was so preoccupied with what to do that I just nodded my head, not understanding what was going on.

688
01:14:47,068 --> 01:14:49,901
You said yes even though you didn't know

689
01:14:53,457 --> 01:14:56,091
How about you were interrogated by the prosecutor?

690
01:14:58,645 --> 01:15:04,832
I didn't expect to be shown another tie at all.

691
01:15:05,546 --> 01:15:07,053
So I was careless

692
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,719
Did you make a lame confession?

693
01:15:11,435 --> 01:15:19,002
As a prosecutor, after fully assessing the defendant's mental state
That's why we interrogated him.

694
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:26,482
Presiding Judge., the prosecutor is conducting a cross-examination.
I haven't finished my statement.

695
01:15:27,009 --> 01:15:28,902
Prosecutor, please be careful.

696
01:15:33,354 --> 01:15:33,881
Presiding Judge. please be careful.

697
01:15:35,014 --> 01:15:42,393
As defense counsel, I would like to submit this newly discovered necktie into evidence.

698
01:15:43,828 --> 01:15:46,802
What does the defense hope to prove with this tie?

699
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:51,263
The defendant's innocence.

700
01:15:53,195 --> 01:15:57,088
If the tie submitted by the prosecutor is the murder weapon

701
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,520
If she didn't use it, he's not a murderer.

702
01:16:02,265 --> 01:16:06,999
There must be someone else who wrapped this tie around Yasui's neck and strangled him to death.

703
01:16:08,984 --> 01:16:15,970
It was probably the man Yasui called his brother.
That man is the real murderer.

704
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,261
What is the opinion of the prosecutor?

705
01:16:23,542 --> 01:16:27,948
Several trials have confirmed the murder weapon and the defendant's guilt.

706
01:16:29,224 --> 01:16:36,236
Defense counsel's sudden assertion of the defendant's innocence is an affront to the court and a contempt of court.

707
01:16:37,262 --> 01:16:39,869
Therefore, the Prosecution objects to this request for evidence.

708
01:16:40,302 --> 01:16:46,371
Presiding Judge, the courtroom is a sacred place where the truth is sought by all means.

709
01:16:47,845 --> 01:16:55,053
Prosecutor ignores defense counsel's statements and refuses to allow the defendant to prove her innocence.
The prosecutor holds the court in contempt.

710
01:16:59,465 --> 01:17:04,119
All right.
I'll allow the defense to present its evidence and the Prime Minister's Office to make its request.

711
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:16,146
Tokuda is great, he said Yasui's bro is murder

712
01:17:17,807 --> 01:17:22,541
I thought it was a simple confession case.
I guess we let our guard down.

713
01:17:26,373 --> 01:17:28,493
I wonder who is the bro

714
01:17:29,448 --> 01:17:33,015
We have too many case, have no time

715
01:17:34,878 --> 01:17:38,658
Do you think the bro is exist?

716
01:17:41,496 --> 01:17:43,210
I wonder tokuda's lie

717
01:17:44,307 --> 01:17:45,994
Anyway let's investigate

718
01:17:50,702 --> 01:17:54,755
This is a picture of Yasui's brother.
Remember which man came in that night?

719
01:18:00,370 --> 01:18:01,476
I don't know.

720
01:18:02,775 --> 01:18:04,909
He was wearing a mask and sunglasses.

721
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:07,735
Can you tell me what his face looked like?

722
01:18:08,728 --> 01:18:10,295
I really don't remember.

723
01:18:10,925 --> 01:18:11,765
Why?

724
01:18:14,496 --> 01:18:24,101
As I've told you many times, I've been beaten, I've been drugged, I've been embarrassed.

725
01:18:24,916 --> 01:18:26,043
be honest

726
01:18:30,178 --> 01:18:32,145
No wonder you don't remember.

727
01:18:33,546 --> 01:18:35,826
There was no bro from the beginning

728
01:18:36,954 --> 01:18:39,434
There was no one at the crime scene but you and Yasui.

729
01:18:41,078 --> 01:18:42,851
there is

730
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:46,159
trust me

731
01:18:47,085 --> 01:18:48,612
Don't underestimate the prosecutor.

732
01:18:51,152 --> 01:18:54,412
Tokuda taught you, You lied,right?

733
01:18:57,353 --> 01:18:59,826
Why would I lie?

734
01:19:01,956 --> 01:19:05,856
I've always told the truth.

735
01:19:06,076 --> 01:19:06,823
Cut it out

736
01:19:08,156 --> 01:19:11,569
You conspired with the defense to defraud the prosecutor and make a fool of the judge.

737
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:14,970
You committed murder and perjured yourself again.

738
01:19:15,989 --> 01:19:18,469
You're in contempt of court.

739
01:19:19,836 --> 01:19:20,736
No, sir.

740
01:19:25,138 --> 01:19:27,365
If you want to keep a clean slate, that's fine.

741
01:19:28,355 --> 01:19:30,921
But if you think you can deceive me forever, you're wrong.

742
01:19:34,116 --> 01:19:35,723
A lie is a lie, and it always gets exposed.

743
01:19:39,724 --> 01:19:42,537
The prosecutor is insist

744
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:47,180
I've been getting called in every day for questioning.

745
01:19:48,103 --> 01:19:49,323
They must be desperate.

746
01:19:50,773 --> 01:19:54,113
If you're acquitted, they lose.

747
01:19:56,285 --> 01:19:59,918
I worry our lie will be found out

748
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:06,869
We live in an age of lies.

749
01:20:08,059 --> 01:20:12,679
Everything from TV commercials to politicians' statements are lies.

750
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:17,111
Compared to that, our lies are cute.

751
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:22,593
But we're dealing with prosecutors and judges.

752
01:20:23,240 --> 01:20:24,753
That's why the layman's in trouble.

753
01:20:26,136 --> 01:20:30,349
The bottom line is, trials are a game of lawyers and prosecutors.

754
01:20:31,546 --> 01:20:32,833
All we have to do is win.

755
01:20:37,471 --> 01:20:40,197
The expert examined this tie.?

756
01:20:42,474 --> 01:20:43,487
what did you find?

757
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:46,801
There were extremely large amounts of human skin fragments on it.

758
01:20:47,923 --> 01:20:51,989
Can you determine that the skin fragment belongs to the victim Yasui?

759
01:20:52,587 --> 01:21:01,212
A small amount of blood soaked in this tie was analyzed.
We have confirmed that it is Yasui's.

760
01:21:02,049 --> 01:21:05,220
How do you think the skin piece got on the tie?

761
01:21:06,345 --> 01:21:10,072
I think it is due to the tightness of Yasui's body and throat.
I'm done.

762
01:21:11,141 --> 01:21:11,781
That's all

763
01:21:14,172 --> 01:21:21,906
The defense claims it was the bro who was at the scene of the crime.
This is just a guess.

764
01:21:25,247 --> 01:21:29,716
And the newly submitted necktie... Probably used by the defendant, YOSHIKO.

765
01:21:30,451 --> 01:21:36,044
He kept it secretly hidden and suddenly brought it to the court to confuse the medical examination.

766
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:42,984
Also, the defendant's confession that a man named BRO was present at the crime scene is highly doubtful and not credible.

767
01:21:45,043 --> 01:21:52,199
I, the prosecutor, find the defendant guilty and sentence him to five years in prison.

768
01:21:54,436 --> 01:22:03,302
The defendant's confession is the only evidence that proves his guilt.

769
01:22:04,834 --> 01:22:12,631
If it is a lie that Bro.
If Bro was there, then the whole confession is a lie, and there is no way to prove the murder.

770
01:22:14,467 --> 01:22:19,623
Also, the prosecutor said that it was my imagination that Bro killed the victim.

771
01:22:21,272 --> 01:22:30,712
Looking at the crime scene photos, there is a cup and a cigarette butt for the defendant and another for the victim, so we can conclude that there was indeed someone there.

772
01:22:32,603 --> 01:22:39,666
It was Yasui's Bro.
And that he had the intent to kill Yasui.
It is clear from the defendant's testimony.

773
01:22:43,561 --> 01:22:50,756
The necktie the defendant used was a cheap, thin one.
It would break easily if he tried to tie it around his neck.

774
01:22:51,131 --> 01:22:53,084
If she kept squeezing it, it would break.

775
01:22:55,069 --> 01:22:59,889
She can't drink.She was on the verge of fainting when she got up

776
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:06,412
Suppose she finds a sturdy necktie in the wardrobe
It would be completely impossible for her to strangle Yasui again

777
01:23:11,342 --> 01:23:19,775
The tie broke and she fainted.
Perhaps Bro took a sturdy tie and strangled Yasui to death.

778
01:23:46,031 --> 01:23:47,304
Yasui is a yakuza.

779
01:23:48,945 --> 01:23:53,726
He must have misbehaved in some way and was sanctioned by Bro.

780
01:23:54,781 --> 01:24:00,320
For Yakuza, killing a gang or two is nothing. Killing a thug or two is nothing to a drug addict.

781
01:24:05,044 --> 01:24:10,075
After the crime, Bro puts his broken tie back in the wardrobe.
and walked away quickly.

782
01:24:11,286 --> 01:24:13,380
It's the most natural thing to do.

783
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:23,617
Based on the above, I am convinced that it was Bro, not Yoshiko, who killed Yasui.

784
01:24:24,461 --> 01:24:29,062
Therefore, as defense counsel, I plead the defendant's innocence.

785
01:24:29,758 --> 01:24:34,773
I believe she should be released for lack of evidence.

786
01:24:40,836 --> 01:24:41,414
How was it?

787
01:24:41,805 --> 01:24:42,844
It didn’t work

788
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:50,484
The police have mobilized detectives to investigate Yasui's Bro, but some of them are missing.

789
01:24:51,523 --> 01:24:54,015
After all, since the gang was disbanded, everyone is in different places.

790
01:24:54,117 --> 01:24:59,796
Besides, the Yakuza are always covering for each other.
It's not good.

791
01:25:00,133 --> 01:25:06,875
In order to convict Yoshiko, we need to take testimonies from all the Bro's and prove that none of them were Yasui. to prove that no one met Yasui.

792
01:25:07,766 --> 01:25:09,500
If that's impossible...

793
01:25:14,384 --> 01:25:16,571
Tokuda must have seen through it all.

794
01:25:17,837 --> 01:25:22,720
If Yasui wasn't a yakuza, our lie would never get through.

795
01:25:26,352 --> 01:25:34,961
He's so obsequious to Bro, and then he gets killed.
Yasui's an idiot.

796
01:25:37,793 --> 01:25:39,371
I wonder what's going to happen to me

797
01:25:40,957 --> 01:25:44,778
Killing people and lying about it.

798
01:25:46,098 --> 01:25:48,825
I'm not the innocent girl I used to be.

799
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:59,652
Innocence is like being a virgin.
Get rid of it and live happily ever after.

800
01:26:04,738 --> 01:26:07,559
Yoshiko, the accused, step forward!

801
01:26:18,342 --> 01:26:20,256
I hereby submit a motion for judgment.

802
01:26:23,678 --> 01:26:24,389
Reason.

803
01:26:39,882 --> 01:26:45,084
You were found not guilty by a lack of evidence.
You're free to go.

804
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:48,884
I wonder if I've really been exonerated.

805
01:26:49,845 --> 01:26:52,196
If the prosecutor doesn't appeal, the verdict's final.

806
01:26:54,462 --> 01:27:01,829
There's a principle in the law that no two cases are ever the same.
The same case never goes to trial twice.

807
01:27:03,775 --> 01:27:08,165
If you're caught lying in the future, you won't be punished.

808
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,353
I see

809
01:27:16,775 --> 01:27:18,556
Will you come to my office tonight?

810
01:27:20,822 --> 01:27:22,213
We'll have a private toast.

811
01:28:02,762 --> 01:28:07,535
1,500,000
Is this my reward?

812
01:28:09,582 --> 01:28:12,340
You forgot the amount we agreed upon.

813
01:28:13,887 --> 01:28:19,464
I haven't forgotten, but things have changed since Yasui died.
Please accept it.

814
01:28:24,698 --> 01:28:28,987
This film Yasui was just showing off, it's pretty good.

815
01:28:29,885 --> 01:28:31,901
Don't look at it

816
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:39,596
If I hadn't taken the locker key earlier.
This film would be in police hands by now, and the press would be all over it.

817
01:28:40,573 --> 01:28:42,455
So what?

818
01:28:43,963 --> 01:28:49,830
I'll get the press together for a preview instead of the police.

819
01:28:50,834 --> 01:28:54,084
Lawyer, you're not blackmailing us?

820
01:28:56,076 --> 01:28:59,147
I just want you to keep your word.

821
01:29:01,459 --> 01:29:04,990
Please pay the correct amount

822
01:29:07,311 --> 01:29:11,740
Five million exactly.
The price of a bed scene between you and Teru-chan.

823
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:14,584
I can buy up a bar for you

824
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:15,842
bar?

825
01:29:17,217 --> 01:29:22,459
The prosecutor withdrew the appeal.
So you've been exonerated.

826
01:29:23,559 --> 01:29:27,927
You'll never be able to live like a human being again.
I'm just trying to give you something to hold on to.

827
01:29:29,216 --> 01:29:30,083
Thanks

828
01:29:32,067 --> 01:29:41,087
I said I can't give you this much money.
I'll lend it to you... by signing this contract.

829
01:29:46,423 --> 01:29:48,868
This money is mine.

830
01:29:49,704 --> 01:29:52,275
I don't need to borrow my own money.

831
01:29:53,454 --> 01:29:54,470
Your own money?

832
01:29:56,556 --> 01:30:00,337
You recommended that I kill Yasui.

833
01:30:01,267 --> 01:30:05,986
You got this money because I did what you told me to do.
I deserve it.

834
01:30:11,853 --> 01:30:13,096
What if I say no?

835
01:30:14,697 --> 01:30:16,775
I'll tell the police what happened.

836
01:30:18,152 --> 01:30:24,496
I'll never be a defendant again, but you're in a lot of trouble.

837
01:30:25,332 --> 01:30:31,621
You falsified the crime scene and defrauded the court.
You'll be disbarred, and you'll go to jail.

838
01:30:32,574 --> 01:30:33,402
Right?

839
01:30:35,317 --> 01:30:36,723
You'll never be a defendant again

840
01:30:41,270 --> 01:30:44,520
you're blackmailing me. you are great

841
01:30:46,215 --> 01:30:50,051
I killed a man because of Lawyer.

842
01:30:52,317 --> 01:30:59,816
You know how horrible it is to kill someone?

843
01:31:03,192 --> 01:31:06,543
I'm not afraid anymore, I can do anything.

844
01:31:10,155 --> 01:31:20,342
I've been a tool for Yasui, for you, for men, and I've had it rough, but now I'm going to bully men.

845
01:31:20,662 --> 01:31:22,600
Yeah, because that's what you do for a living.

846
01:31:27,628 --> 01:31:30,143
I'm going to open a bar and it's going to be a thriving business.

847
01:31:30,925 --> 01:31:36,823
After all, I'm a woman who committed a crime.
I'm sure there will be a lot of guys who will love to come in.

848
01:31:37,526 --> 01:31:40,112
I extort a lot of money from them

849
01:31:42,511 --> 01:31:45,401
Goodbye, lawyer

850
01:31:52,815 --> 01:31:59,654
The money and the girls are gone.
All that's left is a single photograph.

851
01:32:07,592 --> 01:32:13,678
Jinpei Tokuda, if my opponent is a man, I won't lose but she's a woman

852
01:32:15,767 --> 01:32:17,009
It's okay if I lose

853
01:32:27,228 --> 01:32:35,899
THE END

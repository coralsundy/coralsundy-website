25
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:35,146
Mikagero Yoshihara.

You should respect the military.

You all read your own letters first. you are too selfish.
Our warriors are waiting for this letter.

00:07:58,275 --> 00:08:02,119
You caught a fish with a grenade, didn't you?

77
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:03,807
You get it?

00:09:19,409 --> 00:09:20,886
What's wrong,Omiya!

97
00:09:21,831 --> 00:09:22,948
What are you doing?

98
00:09:33,648 --> 00:09:34,726
My stomach

99
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,640
i have a stomach ache

100
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:40,663
Omiya!

101

You have diarrhea and you are gutless

102
00:09:53,531 --> 00:09:54,320
It can't be helped

103
00:09:56,109 --> 00:09:57,765
I think that fried fish was bad

104
00:09:58,882 --> 00:10:01,156

105
00:10:02,446 --> 00:10:03,196

117
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:56,767
The oil for fried fish was castor oil.

118
00:10:58,509 --> 00:10:59,634

119
00:11:01,572 --> 00:11:04,447

121
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:10,357

00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:19,459

130
00:11:49,545 --> 00:11:50,811
You dude!

131
00:11:57,029 --> 00:11:58,162
I'll get out now

132
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:03,826
You're just solider

133
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,387
What are you doing?

134
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:14,676
I want to check if the colors of the soldiers and the poop are different

135
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,605
Hey!

136
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,965
Omiya!
You are just a solider

137
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:27,903
Can't you read this?

138
00:12:28,996 --> 00:12:30,473
I can't read

139
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:35,746
Stop it

140
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:42,300
Who's the hell you are!

141
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:53,201
Today is a competition to test military discipline.

142
00:12:54,637 --> 00:13:02,261
our team is very old.
We have achieved a lot.

143
00:13:02,774 --> 00:13:05,680
Our achievements are very prestigious.

144
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:13,477
We are a great team that follows military discipline very well.

145
00:13:15,023 --> 00:13:28,291
The Emperor praised our team as a great team with very good teamwork.

146
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:35,442
Keep in mind what I said

147
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:40,139
You guys, get ready!

148
00:13:40,607 --> 00:13:42,592
Ready go!

149
00:14:06,874 --> 00:14:10,139
I understand our future war situation

150
00:14:10,819 --> 00:14:11,796
our future?

151
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,069
Why?

152
00:14:14,428 --> 00:14:16,803
we don't have the fabric to make the flag

153
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:29,538
Your turn!

154
00:14:44,414 --> 00:14:46,484
last one!

155
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:49,164
I'll do my best

156
00:14:49,219 --> 00:14:50,258
Go for it!

157
00:15:12,771 --> 00:15:13,716
Hey

158
00:15:15,638 --> 00:15:16,419
Women!

159
00:15:28,154 --> 00:15:30,459
Solders!

160
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:44,435
He's winner

161
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:45,404

162
00:15:46,107 --> 00:15:47,631
you made a misjudge

163
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:49,599
What?

164
00:15:50,123 --> 00:15:55,037
You watched the women and didn't see them fight

165
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:57,953
I saw Omiya win

166
00:16:04,317 --> 00:16:05,294
Omiya!

167
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:12,348
This is your reward

168
00:16:28,609 --> 00:16:29,578
Hold on

169
00:16:30,024 --> 00:16:31,984
I know how you feel

170
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,211
i want to drink this with someone

171
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:01,067
Let's drink,Takumi

172
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:26,444
I heard that you were complained by Colonel Kazuki in the ring.

173
00:17:30,096 --> 00:17:36,393
I hate bowing to people younger than me

174
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:39,281
It can't be helped

175
00:17:40,796 --> 00:17:47,100
Personal connections are very important in the military.

176
00:17:48,398 --> 00:17:52,609
He looks very elegant unlike us

177
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:55,156
How do you mean?

178
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:03,633
His father is a famous military leader in Aomori Prefecture.

179
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:10,876
I hate him but I'm really disguised about Omiya

180
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:13,650
How can we control him?

181
00:18:14,197 --> 00:18:15,853
He's too strong

182
00:18:18,205 --> 00:18:20,845
His friend Arita is very schemer.

183
00:18:22,439 --> 00:18:23,564
That's  the point

184
00:18:25,986 --> 00:18:28,962
I think it's better to separate them

185
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,765
I'll come in

186
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,976
What's wrong,Omiya?

187
00:18:38,195 --> 00:18:40,327
i want to drink with you

188
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:41,101
With me?

189
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:41,741
Yes

190
00:18:42,624 --> 00:18:44,257
Thai is the reward you won

191
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,366
You should drink with your teammates

192
00:18:46,929 --> 00:18:50,929
I'm here to drink with you

193
00:18:54,006 --> 00:18:55,475
Thank you

194
00:18:56,022 --> 00:18:57,069
I'll have it

195
00:18:58,108 --> 00:18:59,014
Have a seat

196
00:19:07,774 --> 00:19:10,790
why don't you go to the leader's meetinghouse?

197
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:12,532
I don't wanna go

198
00:19:13,157 --> 00:19:14,352
You don't like women?

199
00:19:14,634 --> 00:19:15,837
Not

200
00:19:16,915 --> 00:19:20,048
Why do you always read a book in a small room?

201
00:19:20,888 --> 00:19:24,833
There are many things more important to me than women

202
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:31,808
I am amazed that there is anything more important than women here.

203
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:35,886
very interesting

204
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,105
You think so?

205
00:19:39,906 --> 00:19:48,578
Have you slept women before?

206
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,070
No?

207
00:19:53,875 --> 00:19:54,437
No

208
00:19:56,439 --> 00:19:59,150
Are you sure?

209
00:20:01,986 --> 00:20:04,751
I didn't know that.
I was a virgin until I was 17

210
00:20:05,556 --> 00:20:07,134
You lost your virgin when you were 17?

211
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:09,571
I was seduced

212
00:20:16,098 --> 00:20:16,911
What's wrong?

213
00:20:17,575 --> 00:20:20,473
I'm leaving from now

214
00:20:20,498 --> 00:20:21,504
Where are you going?

215
00:20:22,298 --> 00:20:23,727
You can guess

216
00:20:26,821 --> 00:20:29,212
I'm different from you.
See you

217
00:20:42,481 --> 00:20:43,231
Good

218
00:20:51,522 --> 00:20:52,303
Mr.private first class solider

219
00:20:52,328 --> 00:20:52,718
What?

220
00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,499
I'll take Midori today

221
00:20:54,524 --> 00:20:56,945
I won't give her to you

222
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:18,773
Shit. I cut the way

223
00:21:49,972 --> 00:21:50,754
Hey

224
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,738
What's wrong?

225
00:21:56,129 --> 00:21:58,652
I was stuck in the quagmire

226
00:21:58,785 --> 00:22:00,191
Come in

227
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,094
I tied to cut the way

228
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:09,933
Two people

229
00:22:10,238 --> 00:22:11,191
Wait 5 min more

230
00:22:13,308 --> 00:22:14,136
Who's here today?

231
00:22:14,691 --> 00:22:15,675
Satsuki and Yuko

232
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:18,894
You take Satsuki, You take Yuko, wait here

233
00:22:18,933 --> 00:22:22,050
What a nice name

234
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:25,117
You are smelly

235
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,922
You are smelly too.
I can't stand

236
00:22:31,947 --> 00:22:33,615
You are stupid

237
00:22:35,357 --> 00:22:36,865
wait here until I call you

238
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:50,363
Hey

239
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:00,738
He is here to pinch a large amount of money

240
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:05,152
Although he is a superior officer, he does nothing but bad things.

241
00:23:06,386 --> 00:23:07,480
Hold on

242
00:23:10,058 --> 00:23:11,097
Don't be rush

243
00:23:23,346 --> 00:23:24,744
I refreshed

244
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:27,753
What's this?

245
00:23:28,011 --> 00:23:31,589
Watch the sunrise from the top of the mountain in summer

246
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,206
Watch the sunset from the beach in winter

247
00:23:35,941 --> 00:23:37,159
This is nice poem,right?

248
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,464
Enjoy your meal

249
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:45,527
I don't need it.
Come here

250
00:23:47,152 --> 00:23:50,019
what university did you graduate from?

251
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:53,464
I graduated from many universities

252
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,839
I need you to tell me one thing.

253
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:02,683
Tell me

254
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:06,434
Do you know Akiko Yosano?

255
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:10,515
I know

256
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:14,976
Watch the sunrise from the top of the mountain in summer

257
00:24:15,757 --> 00:24:17,562
Watch the sunset from the beach in winter

258
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,296
do you know the meaning of this poem? Kimii means Tekkan?

259
00:24:24,742 --> 00:24:27,234
It could be Tekkan

260
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:34,500
you are very sarcastic

261
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:38,672
Come here

262
00:24:39,976 --> 00:24:43,062
i want to know your favorite poem

263
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:48,031
i want to know your favorite poem

264
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:53,686
You learned poems when you were a student, didn't you?

265
00:24:54,514 --> 00:24:57,920
I have but I don't know if you like it

266
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:03,622
I tell you

267
00:25:07,145 --> 00:25:12,403
That woman fell in love with a customer
Customer say he's coming to the store again

268
00:25:12,739 --> 00:25:15,778
clash of lies and lies

269
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:19,770
Who's the poemist?

270
00:25:19,895 --> 00:25:20,950
Takao Konya

271
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:23,942
I don't know about him

272
00:25:24,489 --> 00:25:27,067
What else?

273
00:25:28,043 --> 00:25:30,379
I'll tell you later

274
00:25:30,404 --> 00:25:32,528
i want to know

275
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,818
Ok I tell you

276
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,599
hell is right there

277
00:25:50,248 --> 00:25:52,412
i don't want to go there

278
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:59,763
The wind with affection was blowing there

279
00:26:01,133 --> 00:26:14,539
I didn't know it was a farewell to brothers

280
00:26:18,807 --> 00:26:22,080
the fog is very thick

281
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:27,221
I can't see any enemies

282
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:30,934
Look at that?

283
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:42,515
Omiya!

284
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,672
Get up,Omiya!

285
00:26:45,808 --> 00:26:46,534
Dinner?

286
00:26:46,636 --> 00:26:48,519
don't fall asleep.
It's time for work

287
00:26:53,636 --> 00:26:54,425
How's it?

288
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,972
I'll report to leader

289
00:27:12,008 --> 00:27:14,329
It's time for work,right?

290
00:27:14,665 --> 00:27:15,813
you are still half asleep

291
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:22,432
You guys tricked me.
Did you sleep?

292
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:24,001
How do you know?

293
00:27:24,665 --> 00:27:26,047
You are stupid

294
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:28,655
Keep watching

295
00:27:32,327 --> 00:27:36,046
Last night, the 3rd team was attacked by the enemy and wiped out.

296
00:27:37,187 --> 00:27:39,866


297
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:47,163
Our team was ordered to scout the vicinity of the water station.

298
00:27:48,655 --> 00:27:52,312
meet there at 1:10 in 5 minutes.

299
00:27:52,702 --> 00:27:54,210
That's all

300
00:27:58,956 --> 00:28:00,878
Hold on,Arita

301
00:28:01,674 --> 00:28:03,979
You go to Takeshima leader's room

302
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:05,721
He's calling you

303
00:28:12,048 --> 00:28:13,540
I'm here

304
00:28:15,458 --> 00:28:20,528
You graduated from university. Why do you want being a soldier

305
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,705
i like being a soldier

306
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,478
You're strange

307
00:28:32,564 --> 00:28:34,939
You'll have you enter the command center from today.

308
00:28:35,455 --> 00:28:37,064
For what?

309
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:44,353
Those who graduated from university were to receive training in cryptanalysis

310
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,298
For 3 months

311
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,033
For 3 months?

312
00:28:49,406 --> 00:28:50,656
This is the transfer order

313
00:28:52,781 --> 00:28:55,047
I have a favor of you

314
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,594
I wanna stay here

315
00:28:57,619 --> 00:28:59,656
you have to follow orders

316
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:06,008
I believe that even in the military I have the right to express your opinion.

317
00:29:07,682 --> 00:29:08,940
right to express your opinion.?

318
00:29:10,096 --> 00:29:11,830
You're cheeky

319
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:16,713
you can't decide for yourself.
You are stupid!

320
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:20,823
Who's the hell you are?

321
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,022
pack your bags and get in the car

322
00:29:37,351 --> 00:29:38,968
Move forward

323
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:53,929
Run!

324
00:30:44,719 --> 00:30:52,492
I'm going without talking to you.
Don't push yourself too hard

325
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,939
I'm tired

326
00:31:37,213 --> 00:31:38,049
Hey

327
00:31:39,682 --> 00:31:40,838
Where's Mr.private first class solider?

328
00:31:41,213 --> 00:31:42,783
Where's he?

329
00:31:43,228 --> 00:31:44,635
He escaped from here?

330
00:31:48,124 --> 00:31:50,515
He doesn't escape without me

331
00:31:52,015 --> 00:31:53,187
I'm kidding

332
00:31:54,525 --> 00:31:55,337
Stop it

333
00:31:59,072 --> 00:32:00,212
Stop it

334
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:03,741
What's this?

335
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:07,585
There's a letter for you

336
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,484
What's this?

337
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,914
From Mr.private first class solider

338
00:32:16,422 --> 00:32:17,976
Attention!

339
00:32:19,434 --> 00:32:25,958
Listen,Arita was transferred as a factor of cryptanalysis from today.

340
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:29,561
Where he's gone?

341
00:32:29,779 --> 00:32:31,764
It's none of your busyness

342
00:32:33,598 --> 00:32:34,215
It is

343
00:32:34,825 --> 00:32:35,379
No

344
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:36,793
It is!

345
00:32:37,793 --> 00:32:39,739
where did you let him go without telling me?

346
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,598
Tell me

347
00:32:42,153 --> 00:32:43,879
What's the hell?

348
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:46,911
I'm your boss

349
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:51,064
Omiya!

350
00:32:52,947 --> 00:32:54,752
Omiya!

351
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:03,986
Stop it

352
00:33:14,497 --> 00:33:15,513
Damn it

353
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,857
Mr.private first class solider

354
00:33:52,435 --> 00:33:53,568
You are stupid

355
00:33:59,848 --> 00:34:03,668
Kanemura, Yoko is new worker but she can't earn much

356
00:34:04,153 --> 00:34:06,434
she has a breast problem

357
00:34:07,522 --> 00:34:10,514
you should be strict with her

358
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:11,850
This is our business

359
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:13,124
I know

360
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:14,585
you should be stricter

361
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:22,066
Satsuki does not sell at all

362
00:34:22,847 --> 00:34:25,199
Did you talk with her?

363
00:34:25,488 --> 00:34:27,793
she always makes excuses

364
00:34:27,818 --> 00:34:29,105
You too

365
00:34:32,618 --> 00:34:35,142
Call her, I gonna teach her

366
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:06,628
you are not a writer.
You just need to serve your customers

367
00:35:07,307 --> 00:35:11,564
I get it.
i fall like you

368
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,299
What's the hell?

369
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,439
You are not learnt yet

370
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:21,635
Make some money and then act like a big shot.

371
00:35:22,564 --> 00:35:28,400
You are not higher class solider.
You are just like rubbish too

372
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:33,472
You should be improve yourself

373
00:35:33,855 --> 00:35:35,496
You have no right to hit me.
You are just scam

374
00:35:52,395 --> 00:36:00,996
This is our business.
But we are at end of line. We are unhappy

375
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:06,449
You are educated, why you work as this?

376
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:11,371
We promised to ask about that

377
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:12,496
I'm sorry

378
00:36:13,891 --> 00:36:15,977
It can't be helped

379
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:26,227
I am of the opinion that if I sell your body, but don't sell my heart, someday I will have a chance.

380
00:36:26,782 --> 00:36:28,407
But it was just my imagination

381
00:36:32,845 --> 00:36:36,681
You should go back in Japan soon

382
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:40,009
I have no home

383
00:36:44,429 --> 00:36:45,632
Does it hurt?

384
00:36:48,132 --> 00:36:52,015
He kicked me

385
00:36:52,241 --> 00:36:55,820
I'll bring some medicine

386
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,733
Thank you

387
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,030
Who?

388
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:13,294
What's wrong?
It's too late

389
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,539
You don't feel good?

390
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,563
Just little

391
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:24,094
I can't serve you tonight

392
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:27,903
I'm in trouble

393
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:33,090
What?That's not so you

394
00:37:34,012 --> 00:37:35,207
Tell me

395
00:37:43,366 --> 00:37:46,585
Can you read this?

396
00:37:47,561 --> 00:37:48,397
Read?

397
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:50,100
I can't read

398
00:38:02,095 --> 00:38:03,134
Omiya

399
00:38:03,806 --> 00:38:06,767
I'll write briefly

400
00:38:07,404 --> 00:38:13,450
Akaike has something to do with my transfer

401
00:38:13,497 --> 00:38:14,083
Akaike?

402
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,638
Where you wrote?

403
00:38:17,693 --> 00:38:18,615
not finished yet

404
00:38:19,777 --> 00:38:28,019
But If I become a cryptanalyst, I think I can figure out when the war will end.

405
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,962
So I decided to go the office

406
00:38:32,024 --> 00:38:35,329
I worry about you

407
00:38:36,376 --> 00:38:43,313
While I am not here,don't escape or fight. otherwise that will be what Akaike aim

408
00:38:43,852 --> 00:38:47,923
Stay calm for 3 months until I will be back

409
00:38:49,266 --> 00:38:52,587
I'll tell you again. Do not escape. Arita

410
00:38:56,985 --> 00:39:00,618
It's too late. I escaped...

411
00:39:02,946 --> 00:39:06,149
You should go back until they find you

412
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,782
I'm surprised

413
00:39:13,399 --> 00:39:15,384
What's wrong?

414
00:39:17,957 --> 00:39:20,699
She's injured. come to my room

415
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,561
What are you doing?
You are here for sex

416
00:39:32,248 --> 00:39:33,733
Am I not good enough?

417
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,783
I don't mean that

418
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,556
That's not so you

419
00:39:43,769 --> 00:39:45,293
Are you sick?

420
00:39:46,293 --> 00:39:49,254
You should rest when you are sick.

421
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:56,629
I want to comfort solders

422
00:39:57,613 --> 00:39:58,886
Do you like solders?

423
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,984
Some solders are so bad

424
00:40:05,477 --> 00:40:09,172
Akaike hit Satsuki so she feels bad

425
00:40:10,735 --> 00:40:11,446
Akaike?

426
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:15,016
Akaike is here?

427
00:40:17,427 --> 00:40:18,786
don't go?

428
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,772
Who are you?

429
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:31,842
Where is Akaike?

430
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,552
Who is it?

431
00:40:46,856 --> 00:40:47,630
It's me

432
00:40:48,302 --> 00:40:49,192
Omiya!

433
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,817
You've escaped

434
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,091
Call Kenpeitai

435
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:56,445
Call them

436
00:40:57,609 --> 00:40:59,007
Call them

437
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,320
What are you going to do to me?

438
00:41:02,821 --> 00:41:06,735
You'll be in trouble if Kenpei come

439
00:41:10,841 --> 00:41:12,184
You are stupid

440
00:41:21,348 --> 00:41:22,700
What are you doing?

441
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:26,106
i do nothing wrong

442
00:41:30,214 --> 00:41:31,073
You are stupid

443
00:41:40,819 --> 00:41:43,014
Stop him!

444
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,178
Clam down

445
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:10,117
It would have been better to hand him over to the military police at once.

446
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:15,293
No way, the military police is suspecting us

447
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:17,975
If I get arrested, you will get arrested too.

448
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,804
I know

449
00:42:22,281 --> 00:42:26,804
It's not good to keep him in jail like this.

450
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:32,460
he is used to being in jail

451
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:38,027
I really wanna beat him

452
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,355
It is most effective to reduce the amount of food he eats

453
00:42:49,369 --> 00:42:50,799
Meal time

454
00:42:55,494 --> 00:42:57,010
I'm starving

455
00:43:00,182 --> 00:43:01,049
What's this?

456
00:43:01,877 --> 00:43:05,401
Reduce the amount of food you eat

457
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:17,007
They reduced the amount of food

458
00:43:29,464 --> 00:43:30,440
What's this?

459
00:43:45,355 --> 00:43:46,448
I'm starving

460
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:52,738
You're smelly.
Go first

461
00:44:02,989 --> 00:44:05,208
Omiya, eat it

462
00:44:05,638 --> 00:44:06,817
This is for you

463
00:44:24,864 --> 00:44:26,075
You bastard

464
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,363
You are solider

465
00:44:30,745 --> 00:44:32,363
You guys watch us

466
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,166
Omiya!

467
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:40,150
What are you doing?

468
00:44:42,345 --> 00:44:43,837
What are you doing?

469
00:45:45,575 --> 00:45:46,677
Mr.private first class solider

470
00:45:49,076 --> 00:45:54,880
I'm about to die

471
00:45:57,814 --> 00:45:59,072
You bastard!

472
00:46:01,275 --> 00:46:02,900
Work hard

473
00:46:09,502 --> 00:46:10,799
Get up

474
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,705
Get up

475
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:20,415
Hold on

476
00:46:20,954 --> 00:46:23,993
You are the same Japanese soldiers.

477
00:46:32,181 --> 00:46:33,939
 calm down and talk

478
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:42,039
Actually I trust you the most

479
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,152
I have a favor to ask from you

480
00:46:45,894 --> 00:46:46,410
So?

481
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:53,058
I want to talk about my MATE

482
00:46:53,386 --> 00:46:55,386
Who?

483
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:57,830
Omiya solder

484
00:46:58,197 --> 00:46:59,580
What's wrong about him?

485
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:09,165
Wanna drink?

486
00:47:11,692 --> 00:47:12,770
is it whiskey?

487
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:18,950
This is my first time drinking this since I came to the field.

488
00:47:20,515 --> 00:47:22,515
you live a life of luxury

489
00:47:30,656 --> 00:47:35,375
Why you take care of me so much?

490
00:47:49,305 --> 00:47:51,695
you saw me the other day

491
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,516
Are you into me?

492
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:25,478
i feel like I’m dreaming

493
00:48:25,588 --> 00:48:26,619
It's true

494
00:48:28,331 --> 00:48:32,284
are you always here?

495
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:36,073
I am always in Shoutoku

496
00:48:36,448 --> 00:48:38,964
I come here only twice a week

497
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,831
you don't work for five days?

498
00:48:41,886 --> 00:48:42,691
Yeah

499
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:46,100
It's waste time

500
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,116
You seem to be Tokyo person

501
00:48:51,317 --> 00:48:54,153
I was born in Sumida in Tokyo

502
00:48:54,178 --> 00:48:57,004
It bring me back my memory

503
00:48:57,029 --> 00:49:00,497
I lived Mukojima before coming here

504
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:02,137
Mukojima?

505
00:49:02,824 --> 00:49:04,074
Do you know Mukojima?

506
00:49:04,495 --> 00:49:07,292
I lived near by Mukojima

507
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,024
Can I play?

508
00:49:14,211 --> 00:49:15,172
Sure

509
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:24,097
But If the boss finds it, it's a problem

510
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:25,308
Don't worry

511
00:49:25,843 --> 00:49:30,164
He went to headquarters and won't be back until evening.

512
00:50:01,037 --> 00:50:03,264
I'm horny

513
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:06,475
I'm horny too

514
00:50:28,948 --> 00:50:31,893
Please use this opportunity to meet with me from time to time

515
00:50:36,225 --> 00:50:37,811
Please

516
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:46,952
you should go home soon

517
00:50:47,764 --> 00:50:50,194
What? I really love you

518
00:50:50,436 --> 00:50:52,998
It's good for you

519
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:58,850
I won't leave you no matter who comes

520
00:51:04,964 --> 00:51:06,245
What are you doing?

521
00:51:16,314 --> 00:51:17,181
You are stupid

522
00:51:20,025 --> 00:51:21,532
You bastard!

523
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,237
I'm starving

524
00:52:12,834 --> 00:52:15,076
Akemi was nice woman

525
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:22,042
Where's Mr.private first class solider

526
00:52:24,511 --> 00:52:26,417
i have a stomach ache

527
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:31,327
Where's Mr.private first class solider

528
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:36,952
Insulting the boss is a felony.

529
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:40,804
Inhumane acts like that should not be tolerated.

530
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:44,100
it's my job to decide it

531
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:47,098
it's not your job

532
00:52:47,528 --> 00:52:49,746
I'm asking you

533
00:52:50,692 --> 00:52:54,418
you think bad things will happen to you if you get involved with him

534
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:55,450
Shut up

535
00:52:56,746 --> 00:52:59,168
Please consider about it

536
00:52:59,817 --> 00:53:01,512
It's pointless

537
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:05,204
We should make an example out of him.

538
00:53:07,649 --> 00:53:09,102
I’m not going to reconsider

539
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:11,110
We shouldn't make an example out of him.

540
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:12,001
Shut up

541
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,844
are you going to defy me?
Get out!

542
00:53:16,837 --> 00:53:18,821
I'm leaving, Katsuki leader

543
00:53:20,165 --> 00:53:26,431
I finished my cryptanalysis education on July 7th

544
00:53:27,142 --> 00:53:30,712
Starting today, I'm going back here to work in the encryption room.

545
00:53:31,571 --> 00:53:33,149
I report this to you

546
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:37,844
Relax

547
00:53:39,368 --> 00:53:46,852
Your grades were excellent, so the three-and-a-half-month plan turned into one-and-a-half months.

548
00:53:48,309 --> 00:53:49,716
Good luck with your work

549
00:53:55,369 --> 00:53:56,479
Arita first class solider

550
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:00,104
Welcome back

551
00:54:01,518 --> 00:54:02,494
Mizumaki

552
00:54:03,229 --> 00:54:04,377
You guys ok?

553
00:54:05,557 --> 00:54:06,971
How's Omiya?

554
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:10,855
He's in a jail

555
00:54:12,605 --> 00:54:14,534
What? He's in a jail

556
00:54:30,001 --> 00:54:32,173
Hey,What are you doing?

557
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,151
I'm doing nothing

558
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,479
What's ur name?

559
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,941
I'm Arita first class solider who is Omiya's friend

560
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:56,957
i wanted to tell him i was back

561
00:54:57,639 --> 00:54:59,084
You are stupid

562
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:09,581
Mr.private first class solider!

563
00:55:22,637 --> 00:55:23,621
Arita first class solider!

564
00:55:29,004 --> 00:55:30,238
Did you back today?

565
00:55:30,582 --> 00:55:31,590
Yes

566
00:55:32,402 --> 00:55:34,754
Why you know of me?

567
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:37,738
I wanna talk about Omiya. come with me

568
00:55:42,683 --> 00:55:43,847
Wanna smoke

569
00:55:44,738 --> 00:55:46,027
No thanks

570
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,636
Be relax

571
00:55:53,402 --> 00:56:00,160
He wasn't being treated well, so I discussed it with my leadership.

572
00:56:01,254 --> 00:56:02,652
But it didn't work well

573
00:56:04,496 --> 00:56:07,301
I heard about you and Ogami from Mizumaki.

574
00:56:08,677 --> 00:56:15,935
I asked my father's friend to bring you back here ahead of schedule.

575
00:56:17,942 --> 00:56:22,153
I see.
thank you for everything

576
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:26,910
That's all I could

577
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:32,589
I'll leave it to you for the rest.
You know?

578
00:56:34,292 --> 00:56:34,878
Sure

579
00:56:45,761 --> 00:56:46,784
Please

580
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:57,683
What's wrong?
do you have any problem?

581
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:01,341
Nothing

582
00:57:01,779 --> 00:57:03,888
you seem to be in trouble lately

583
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,763
I'm going out.
Take care of this work

584
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:22,529
Who?

585
00:57:23,748 --> 00:57:25,232
I'm Arita

586
00:57:30,718 --> 00:57:33,023
What are you doing here?

587
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,804
you are very bad as usual

588
00:57:37,506 --> 00:57:40,366
You teamed up with a friend to create a double bookkeeping system.

589
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:45,515
you were fraudulently taking military bonds

590
00:57:48,763 --> 00:57:53,271
You...ok..come with me

591
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:20,538
will you take me to court?
I will shoot you

592
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:25,364
Shoot me if you like

593
00:58:26,192 --> 00:58:33,371
I put the proof and a note about you in my room.

594
00:58:36,485 --> 00:58:39,102
What if military know about this?

595
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,118
Kagenuma and Takejima will be killed too

596
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:53,628
Ok. let's deal

597
00:58:56,255 --> 00:59:00,216
Listen to me.
Get Omiya out the jail

598
00:59:01,083 --> 00:59:05,029
And Hire him as a security guard in the cryptanalysis room

599
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:12,157
Thank you

600
00:59:16,508 --> 00:59:17,508
Thank you

601
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:21,665
did you read the letter i wrote?

602
00:59:23,725 --> 00:59:26,061
I wasn't here at the time

603
00:59:30,326 --> 00:59:31,232
Never mind

604
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,592
i am happy to see you after a long time

605
00:59:36,754 --> 00:59:38,528
How was your training?

606
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:42,129
It was difficult

607
00:59:42,154 --> 00:59:42,973
For the training?

608
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:53,578
I mean, war situation.
i learned a lot of information

609
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:57,627
Japan is going to lose

610
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:01,423
is the situation so bad?

611
01:00:04,644 --> 01:00:11,246
We want it to be clear that if we lose, we lose, if we win, we win.

612
01:00:12,043 --> 01:00:13,824
What should we do

613
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,840
What should we do

614
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,161
I know

615
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:26,716
I give it to you

616
01:00:26,779 --> 01:00:29,279
Thank you very much

617
01:00:30,443 --> 01:00:32,841
You look tired

618
01:00:33,568 --> 01:00:35,349
Don't push yourself too hard

619
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,024
I like being tired

620
01:01:45,523 --> 01:01:46,562
You

621
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:54,101
Thank you for the other day

622
01:01:56,515 --> 01:02:00,593
I hear you've been punished

623
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:06,296
It was piece of cake.
I present this to you

624
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,547
I came too late

625
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:13,828
What's wrong?

626
01:02:14,406 --> 01:02:15,476
You don't know?

627
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:22,141
Japanese here will return to CHOUKAKKOU on today's truck.

628
01:02:24,035 --> 01:02:26,434
So they are busy today

629
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:32,942
So...

630
01:02:35,636 --> 01:02:36,839
We are

631
01:02:40,183 --> 01:02:42,121
It's a clean break.

632
01:02:45,141 --> 01:02:45,993
Kind of

633
01:02:56,618 --> 01:02:57,040
Ouch

634
01:02:57,126 --> 01:02:57,868
Does it hurt?

635
01:03:06,353 --> 01:03:09,751
get on the truck quickly

636
01:03:09,776 --> 01:03:12,368
We have to leave on time

637
01:03:12,814 --> 01:03:16,056
Everyone get on the truck?
Let's go

638
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,993
Satsuki and Yuko has not come yet

639
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:21,688
Take them

640
01:03:25,954 --> 01:03:29,243
Yuko is in trouble

641
01:03:29,268 --> 01:03:32,704
I'll go there

642
01:03:36,153 --> 01:03:38,825
What's wrong Yuko?

643
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,560
She is dead

644
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:47,544
Yuko?

645
01:03:51,138 --> 01:03:54,560
let's leave her

646
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:58,089
Where are you going?

647
01:03:58,214 --> 01:04:00,308
But She is dead

648
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:02,871
I can't look after her

649
01:04:05,236 --> 01:04:07,916
do you say that in front of buddha?

650
01:04:10,228 --> 01:04:12,517
you took a lot of money from her

651
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:19,017
You get on the truck and go first,Satsuki

652
01:04:23,947 --> 01:04:26,877
See you Yuko

653
01:04:37,885 --> 01:04:39,424
They depart soon

654
01:04:39,627 --> 01:04:40,534
You are stupid

655
01:04:41,721 --> 01:04:45,245
You should make a memorial service for her.

656
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:49,080
I can't.
Do you want money?

657
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:04,183
See you Omiya

658
01:05:10,683 --> 01:05:13,573
Let's meet again if there is a connection

659
01:05:16,269 --> 01:05:17,495
Good luck

660
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:31,894
Omiya!

661
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,114
What's wrong?

662
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:29,200
this is an emergency order

663
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,099
What's wrong?

664
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:42,857
This seems to be a very important command

665
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:54,150
Get up and get together!

666
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,970
this is an emergency order

667
01:07:00,906 --> 01:07:07,742
The enemy is massing 40 kilometers east of RYOMEN.

668
01:07:08,219 --> 01:07:11,844
It'll be hard to defeat them

669
01:07:12,742 --> 01:07:16,109
We have to get over this

670
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:18,761
Katsuki

671
01:07:20,566 --> 01:07:24,323
You must form a convoy immediately.

672
01:07:24,956 --> 01:07:27,292
Move military flags to Amano in Saiching

673
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:31,434
Let's get prepared

674
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:43,731
Move forward

675
01:10:11,988 --> 01:10:13,488
Hey, Hase!

676
01:10:14,902 --> 01:10:15,933
Damn it

677
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:20,615
Leader!

678
01:10:45,834 --> 01:10:47,186
Call headquarter

679
01:10:48,727 --> 01:10:54,336
This is guard team. can you hear me?

680
01:10:54,649 --> 01:10:57,266
This is head quarter

681
01:10:58,157 --> 01:11:03,672
We are under attack by the enemy and we are struggling.

682
01:11:04,282 --> 01:11:07,008
I get it.
Let me know the location

683
01:11:08,610 --> 01:11:11,141

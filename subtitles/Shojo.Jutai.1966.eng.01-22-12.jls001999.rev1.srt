2
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:34,726
A wind and woman?

3
00:00:36,806 --> 00:00:38,912
Aiko Takano is also at a turning point?

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,101
I don't feel like she's making any progress.

5
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:29,810
I understand How she has the impatience of trying to somehow break out of her shell, but...

6
00:01:53,237 --> 00:01:55,393
This may be her limit.

7
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,606
Still, She's not losing her popularity.

8
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,606
Her paintings are for rich people's homes and hotels.

9
00:02:00,676 --> 00:02:05,219
The decoration of a rich person's reception room or a hotel lobby is something I can't imagine

10
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,362
The color has lost its depth and the spirit has become delicious

11
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:12,625
Also,she's so beautiful and friendly.

12
00:02:17,165 --> 00:02:17,945
Welcome.

13
00:02:18,073 --> 00:02:19,071
congratulations!

14
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:21,286
Thanks.
Please take your time.

15
00:02:21,372 --> 00:02:22,492
Thank you in advance.

16
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:27,062
That's the son of the picture dealer who deal her paints.

17
00:02:29,393 --> 00:02:32,317
It's really popular!
My dad is happy too.

18
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:34,129
I'm sure he'll come to greet you someday.

19
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,606
He does not need.

20
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:36,896
We've already sold five paints.

21
00:02:37,376 --> 00:02:38,892
At this rate we might all be sold.

22
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,025
Is he Yatabe?

23
00:02:44,324 --> 00:02:46,375
He had been standing in front of that painting for a while now.

24
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:55,072
I think I managed to finish just one of the pictures.

25
00:02:57,763 --> 00:02:58,956
Welcome.

26
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,340
Hi.

27
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:03,716
Can you review this?

28
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:07,502
I am a complete amateur so I can't.

29
00:03:07,801 --> 00:03:09,601
Anything fine with me.

30
00:03:10,298 --> 00:03:12,611
please help me with my studies

31
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:15,453
I see..well...

32
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:23,146
Well...this paint is..

33
00:03:25,258 --> 00:03:30,733
The instinct of a woman who continues to seek eternal happiness.

34
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,149
I guess I could say something like that.

35
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,940
Is that really what I draw?

36
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:43,346
Of course, this is just my personal opinion.

37
00:03:43,371 --> 00:03:45,741
It's probably not what you think, but...

38
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:55,172
It would be rude to say something like this but.

39
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:04,385
The real you is probably lonely and very unhappy.

40
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:06,923
That's what I feel.

41
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,068
Me?

42
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:11,740
I have only bought three paints from you so far.

43
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
That's the feeling you get in my paints?

44
00:04:16,928 --> 00:04:20,759
Well..I was sorry to say that.

45
00:04:21,932 --> 00:04:22,538
Hello.

46
00:04:22,836 --> 00:04:23,596
Welcome.

47
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:24,975
I'll be off now.

48
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,235
Thank you for coming.

49
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:30,634
There's crowed.

50
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,637
It's all thanks to you.

51
00:04:32,849 --> 00:04:33,595
No way.

52
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,575
You did a great promoting on your magazine.

53
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,332
Thank you.

54
00:04:38,829 --> 00:04:40,556
Congratulations on everything.

55
00:04:41,245 --> 00:04:44,708
Where will you be shooting for next month's gravure issue?

56
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:46,985
Here's fine.

57
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,506
I wonder what it is that will save me from my loneliness and misery

58
00:04:53,660 --> 00:05:03,470
<i>Shojo Jutai (1966)</i>

59
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,096
Aiko.

60
00:06:34,933 --> 00:06:40,386
I've dated many women, but there's never been one like you

61
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,300
What does that mean?

62
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:52,971
In many ways.

63
00:06:53,228 --> 00:06:57,143
That's silly.
I read your novels these days.

64
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:00,273
Aiko.

65
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,357
Could you please draw for my portfolio?

66
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,029
Why are you saying that?

67
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:15,640
Your paint made my magazine a best seller for 3 months.

68
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:18,442
It was 7 years ago,right?

69
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,502
Back then, everything in front of me was shining gold.

70
00:07:26,316 --> 00:07:27,612
Is it pink now?

71
00:07:28,113 --> 00:07:29,093
Stop it.

72
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:32,596
It's dark now.

73
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,804
I've even lost sight of myself

74
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:41,496
Yourself?
It's better to lose sight of such things.

75
00:07:43,461 --> 00:07:45,148
It was a waste after all.

76
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:50,609
I thought maybe if I met you I might find a way out

77
00:08:10,728 --> 00:08:12,058
Shall we go too?

78
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:13,319
No.

79
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:15,388
What's going on?

80
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,504
I don't care, it's fine

81
00:08:22,017 --> 00:08:23,433
Leave it here

82
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,851
I guess how much I could drink.

83
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,103
You met him for that,right?

84
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,053
I got sick of it

85
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,395
Why do you say that so suddenly?

86
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:43,142
I suddenly got tired of it

87
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,857
I guess you hate me.

88
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,216
That may be true.

89
00:08:50,598 --> 00:08:54,158
Aiko, you seems to be pretty drunk.

90
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,290
A woman's life is short

91
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,129
In that short time, I want to know what makes a man attractive

92
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,465
I guess I'm  greedy.

93
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:24,687
Am I really hitting a dead end

94
00:09:27,163 --> 00:09:29,343
I can't paint anymore?

95
00:09:44,772 --> 00:09:46,157
I've been looking you

96
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:47,550
Welcome.

97
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,030
When I went to your house in Tokyo

98
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,267
the maid said she didn't know where to go

99
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,864
How did you know about here?

100
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:56,550
My guess.

101
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,402
I thought maybe you were going back to your hometown

102
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,444
Are you here for your magazine project?

103
00:10:03,286 --> 00:10:07,878
and I'd like to take some photos for you, This is my work called "a painter going to his hometown".

104
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,469
Besides me, who else?

105
00:10:12,386 --> 00:10:16,813
Kita,  Onishi, and  Kurita.

106
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,050
You're the only woman

107
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,271
That would be an honor.

108
00:10:21,376 --> 00:10:22,586
Would you please come us?

109
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,620
You're so sneaky.

110
00:10:25,979 --> 00:10:27,387
Anyway, let's go home

111
00:10:40,981 --> 00:10:42,343
What a nice garden.

112
00:10:44,016 --> 00:10:46,049
I didn't think you'd be so rich.

113
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,920
The land around here was liberated after the war?

114
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,317
Almost all the fields are gone, and only that mountain remains.

115
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,861
It's hard to take care of trees.

116
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,763
Those hinoki cypress trees?

117
00:11:06,348 --> 00:11:07,435
Is cypress expensive?

118
00:11:08,819 --> 00:11:11,819
Apparently a 100 year old Hinoki tree costs 1 million yen!

119
00:11:12,873 --> 00:11:15,018
1 million yen? for 1?

120
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,832
1 million yen...

121
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,550
Your house is built on this incredible wealth

122
00:11:26,792 --> 00:11:27,678
You think so?

123
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:29,416
Yeah.

124
00:11:31,063 --> 00:11:32,339
I'm saying big but

125
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,787
I believe I will be of some help to your growth.

126
00:11:36,953 --> 00:11:38,606
I really understand about you more than anyone else.

127
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,045
I was able to prepare a meal for you.

128
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:53,186
Thank you for the meal.

129
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:02,544
Are you so full ?

130
00:12:03,031 --> 00:12:05,281
I can't eat any more

131
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,382
Never, this Murakami-san is the one who proposed marriage to me

132
00:12:20,505 --> 00:12:22,507
What do you think?

133
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:26,027
You're a perfect couple.

134
00:13:46,448 --> 00:13:50,890
Rest room is outside of the room.

135
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,253
Thank you so much.

136
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:01,397
Where is she sleeping?

137
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:17,605
Are you still awake?

138
00:14:17,637 --> 00:14:20,134
I was wondering what was going on because I could hear people talking

139
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,141
Come here.

140
00:14:24,316 --> 00:14:27,316
It's terrible to come all the way here and make you sleep alone.

141
00:14:27,874 --> 00:14:29,394
What's wrong?

142
00:14:29,741 --> 00:14:30,901
I've been waiting for long time.

143
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:36,356
Murakami-san, shall we get married?

144
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Is it true that I will give you our house and our mountain.

145
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,110
Are you sure?

146
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,852
In return, you have to live here and look after our property.

147
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,769
What are you going to do?

148
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,694
And of course I'll be in Tokyo as usual

149
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,309
Because if I stay in a place like this I won't be able to paint

150
00:15:00,896 --> 00:15:02,379
You don't like it.

151
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:05,670
I don't mind.

152
00:15:06,161 --> 00:15:07,842
But you will be in Tokyo with another guy, I worry about that.

153
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,893
I don't know what will be happening.

154
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:12,525
Good night.

155
00:15:13,691 --> 00:15:15,231
Hold on.

156
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:17,793
Baya will be here.

157
00:15:40,868 --> 00:15:42,095
 Good morning

158
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:47,719
Please wash your face.

159
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:51,680
Thank you, Aiko-san is not awake yet?

160
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:54,494
She left this morning.

161
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:56,388
She left?

162
00:15:57,227 --> 00:16:05,515
I have been told that everything she said last night was a joke

163
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:35,228
It's been so long since I've been able to pain.
Why can't I paint anymore?

164
00:17:04,872 --> 00:17:06,585
It's not burning.

165
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,443
what's wrong?

166
00:17:10,753 --> 00:17:12,079
I can't do anything.

167
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:18,539
Anyway, please accept this from your father

168
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,290
If I don't, my dad will get angry with me.

169
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,686
You are from a wealthy family,

170
00:17:25,746 --> 00:17:28,372
so no matter how much I tell my father that money is no good, he doesn't understand

171
00:17:28,989 --> 00:17:30,134
No, even if I knew

172
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,604
We don't want someone else to take your painting away from you.

173
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:34,865
I'm honored.

174
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:37,728
He thinks I'm a money making bird.

175
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,323
I don't mean that.

176
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,450
Would you like to go to Yokohama?

177
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:46,690
I found a Chinese restaurant that is a little dirty but very good

178
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:53,060
You're in a bad mood What's wrong with you today?

179
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:54,287
Yeah.

180
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:58,050
Go home.Go home.

181
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,940
I am here to consult with you.

182
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:14,854
What is this?

183
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,416
About my work.

184
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,442
I'm in trouble.

185
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:28,884
Can I help you with any issues related to art?

186
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:34,787
Please, as you said before, I am lonely

187
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:41,920
To be honest, I haven't been able to paint recently

188
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,199
You can't?

189
00:18:48,938 --> 00:18:50,752
I guess I hit a wall.

190
00:18:52,263 --> 00:18:53,890
I can no longer paint.

191
00:18:55,036 --> 00:18:56,340
Teacher, what should I do?

192
00:18:58,813 --> 00:18:59,619
Takano

193
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,616
I am a doctor

194
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,535
I can only find a disease.

195
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,238
The paintings that you have bought of me so far are my favorites

196
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:14,970
So I feel like you know me,

197
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,590
so please tell me what to do

198
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:21,996
As I have said many times

199
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:25,020
I am a snob who has nothing to do with art.

200
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,317
I say this as a snob

201
00:19:29,467 --> 00:19:30,487
You have to marry.

202
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:37,006
A woman will first marry the man she loves

203
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,500
Next, I'll give birth to that man's child

204
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:44,524
I think giving birth to a child is the most wonderful and important thing for a woman

205
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,360
I don't just want to get married

206
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:49,493
Why?

207
00:19:50,424 --> 00:19:53,012
I feel like if I get into the confines of marriage,

208
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,566
I will become even more useless

209
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:57,766
What does that mean?

210
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,790
I'm afraid of being tied down mentally.

211
00:20:01,974 --> 00:20:04,459
That's not good.
I can't get married.

212
00:20:06,451 --> 00:20:09,878
I have no choice but to say anything.

213
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:13,321
Come in.

214
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,234
Please come in.

215
00:20:20,414 --> 00:20:21,005
Thank you for your support

216
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,556
I have been discharged from the hospital

217
00:20:22,607 --> 00:20:24,055
Thank you very much for everything.

218
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,290
I'm glad.
She's sleeping well.

219
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,252
Aren't you happy?

220
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,653
You're her mother now.

221
00:20:34,603 --> 00:20:35,710
She's so cute.

222
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,320
I didn't think it would be this cute.

223
00:20:39,345 --> 00:20:40,649
Right? Right?

224
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,803
Please take good care of her.

225
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,424
Of course, we'll do my best

226
00:20:58,902 --> 00:21:06,886
Can a woman's happiness of getting married and having children go hand in hand with her career?

227
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,539
I don't know.

228
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:47,955
Hello?

229
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:56,179
It's been ages.

230
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,134
What's wrong?

231
00:21:58,379 --> 00:21:59,695
Sorry I scared you.

232
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,204
Suddenly I wanted to see your face.

233
00:22:01,229 --> 00:22:02,465
I'm so happy. Sorry

234
00:22:02,702 --> 00:22:03,595
Come in.

235
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,511
it's been years since you last saw me

236
00:22:07,383 --> 00:22:09,786
It's still small and dirty,

237
00:22:09,817 --> 00:22:11,328
but it's great.

238
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:13,318
Don't flatter me.

239
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,527
Where's your husband?

240
00:22:14,942 --> 00:22:15,953
My husband is still at work

241
00:22:16,078 --> 00:22:17,405
Oh I see.

242
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,516
I remember that Kei-chan is in kindergarten?

243
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:21,561
Yeah.

244
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,211
He's taking a nap now.

245
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:24,336
I see.

246
00:22:25,317 --> 00:22:26,784
You look happy.

247
00:22:27,051 --> 00:22:27,917
You think so?

248
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,581
I might be happy in a different way than you are

249
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,806
Do you draw pictures?

250
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:35,295
but I don't have any amazing talent like Aiko

251
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,246
Well, I'm just doing it as a hobby,

252
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,281
but it's no good.

253
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:45,735
This is for Kei-chan

254
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,926
I'd never seen you knitting before.

255
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:53,479
After Kei-chan was born
I just naturally started to like doing this kind of thing.

256
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:54,229
It's strange

257
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,176
What's wrong?

258
00:22:58,948 --> 00:23:00,626
It's nothing like that.

259
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,656
 You look a little pale,

260
00:23:03,263 --> 00:23:04,710
Are you tired from working too hard?

261
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:06,304
It's nothing really.

262
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,959
That's fine, but let me make some tea

263
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,850
It's not a particularly good painting, , but there's something about it that draws me in

264
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:51,587
I wonder what it is that attracts me so much.

265
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:00,078
The tea is ready

266
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:06,605
Is he till asleep?

267
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:10,625
I am weird after all

268
00:24:11,547 --> 00:24:12,117
Why?

269
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:14,701
I didn't you buy a souvenir for Kei-chan.

270
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,645
If I were a normal woman, I would notice it.

271
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,670
What are you talking about?
That's so you,Aiko.

272
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:24,831
I'm a strange woman after all

273
00:24:26,215 --> 00:24:27,442
Something is needed.

274
00:24:29,148 --> 00:24:31,750
I've never felt a purpose in life as a woman.

275
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,259
Mom.

276
00:24:42,418 --> 00:24:43,458
Did you get up?

277
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,090
I've never felt envious of someone before,

278
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,220
but today I wonder why I'm so envious of her.

279
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,984
Hello Kei-chan

280
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:06,358
Say hello.

281
00:25:06,898 --> 00:25:08,311
Hello.

282
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:23,055
Say hello to your husband.

283
00:25:37,597 --> 00:25:38,210
Kei-chan.

284
00:25:39,959 --> 00:25:42,530
I didn't know anything about it

285
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,340
Do you like cars?

286
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,847
Yes.

287
00:25:47,226 --> 00:25:49,082
Let's go for a ride together.

288
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,176
You're lucky.

289
00:26:02,938 --> 00:26:05,938
What do you want to do when you grow up?

290
00:26:06,844 --> 00:26:08,251
I'll draw pictures like mom.

291
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:10,810
Do you like to draw?

292
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,160
I want to see Kei-chan's work.

293
00:26:23,661 --> 00:26:25,188
This is Mommy.

294
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:38,407
If I could have a child, I might be reborn

295
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,660
You were surprised to receive such a telegram so suddenly, weren't you?"

296
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,425
Yes I was.

297
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,122
Sorry, You've only written " come here"

298
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,243
I’m sorry.

299
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,593
I suddenly wanted to see you.

300
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:03,186
I think you tired.
Are you alright?

301
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:07,380
I'm thinking about having a baby.

302
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,610
Well, you suddenly said something like that

303
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:14,970
Please don't make me too surprise.

304
00:27:15,415 --> 00:27:16,935
Do you support me?

305
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,712
I've been waiting it for the past six years

306
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,950
So, is the person who will become your husband Mr. Murakami from the other day?

307
00:27:28,586 --> 00:27:30,040
No.

308
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:35,169
that is someone I don't know

309
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,114
Someone I don't know either

310
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:42,652
Please speak clearly.

311
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,750
Who is your husband?

312
00:27:47,215 --> 00:27:48,722
Do you know about Artificial insemination?

313
00:27:49,522 --> 00:27:52,790
I can have a child without a husband

314
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,859
That's not good idea.

315
00:27:58,539 --> 00:28:02,340
I really want to have children, but I don't want to get married

316
00:28:02,842 --> 00:28:03,597
So...

317
00:28:04,751 --> 00:28:06,124
What are you talking about?

318
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,500
You are the daughter of the Takano family.

319
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,253
That's not good you would give birth to a child without husband.

320
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:21,217
I thought that only you would understand my feelings,

321
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:23,291
but that was impossible.

322
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,300
Well, that's fine. Take a bath.

323
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:30,203
Kiyo-san, give her a towel.

324
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:45,892
I really want a child that is just mine

325
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,684
Just mine.

326
00:28:50,657 --> 00:28:53,612
There are two ways to have my own child artificial insemination

327
00:28:54,246 --> 00:29:00,865
First, AIH and second, AID

328
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:09,419
First of all, AIH is when the recipient's husband's sperm are used

329
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,136
In many cases, artificial insemination is performed

330
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,160
because the husband's sperm are extremely weak

331
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,336
Therefore, even if ovulation dates are measured perfectly,

332
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,572
the chances of success are low

333
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:28,320
In contrast, AID is a method of using someone else's excellent work

334
00:29:28,511 --> 00:29:31,216
that meets all the requirements,

335
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,084
and the probability of success is extremely high

336
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:37,238
Okay, any question?

337
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:44,987
Whatever the reason, donors and recipients
must never tell each other who they are?

338
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:48,860
Of course, when it comes to artificially inseminated children,

339
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:53,880
various difficult legal issues can arise,
such as issues of inheritance rights

340
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,140
When did artificial insemination start in Japan?

341
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,090
It's been 20 years already, and there must have been about
4,000 children born as a result of it.

342
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:05,993
Okay, any question?

343
00:30:07,259 --> 00:30:08,146
That' all for today.

344
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:15,517
Satoru-kun and Ozu-kun, please stay.

345
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,870
There's another operation today, so I'm counting on you

346
00:30:27,157 --> 00:30:27,557
Yes.

347
00:30:32,222 --> 00:30:33,229
Are you alright?

348
00:30:34,136 --> 00:30:34,596
Yes.

349
00:30:53,454 --> 00:30:55,191
Do you want to take an artificial insemination?

350
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,693
because I wanted to have a child

351
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:01,093
So please.

352
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:03,957
I was surprised.

353
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,316
Although it is called artificial insemination,

354
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,340
there are various conditions for receiving it

355
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:14,110
First, you need to have the couple come together

356
00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:17,810
and confirm their consent

357
00:31:18,171 --> 00:31:21,369
That's because, unlike blood transfusions,

358
00:31:22,094 --> 00:31:25,145
it creates a human being and sends him out into the world

359
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,596
For the sake of the child's life,

360
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,620
you must be extremely careful.

361
00:31:31,979 --> 00:31:33,380
In my case?

362
00:31:33,661 --> 00:31:35,941
You don't meet the conditions.
Sorry.

363
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,594
Umemura is here.

364
00:31:48,538 --> 00:31:49,298
operating room is ready?

365
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:50,738
Yes.

366
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,032
I have an operation coming up, see you.

367
00:32:03,447 --> 00:32:04,187
Satoru?

368
00:32:11,816 --> 00:32:13,126
Is today's person beautiful?

369
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,693
I'll tell Dr.Yatabe.

370
00:32:51,213 --> 00:32:53,918
Apparently She was female artist, Takano Aiko.

371
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:55,092
Yes.

372
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,636
She came to see a doctor?

373
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,009
She knows Dr.yatabe.

374
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:01,370
I see.

375
00:33:03,367 --> 00:33:07,656
Will you go to watch a movie this coming Saturday?
I'll buy the ticket.

376
00:33:07,783 --> 00:33:09,063
I'm busy with my study.

377
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:24,205
That's neurotic.

378
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,179
Are you not interested in whose body your sperm will enter?

379
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:31,678
No.

380
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,656
Generally speaking, artificial insemination itself is a human emotion

381
00:33:37,723 --> 00:33:39,010
It's just a mechanical thing that ignores everything

382
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:39,994
But...

383
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,551
It bothers me that a woman I don't know is making my baby.

384
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:52,689
Even if we could find out who it was, it wouldn't do us any good

385
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,986
If she's a beautiful woman, that's fine, but if she's a woman

386
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,560
 but if she's a ugly woman

387
00:33:57,910 --> 00:34:00,910
That will only lead to hopeless self-loathing

388
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:02,746
Don't say that

389
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,017
You shouldn't take it so seriously.

390
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,549
We both passed strict requirements and were selected by Professor Yatabe.

391
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,848
It has to do with our paths.

392
00:34:25,395 --> 00:34:27,435
Why is this not okay?

393
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:29,259
No, it's not okay

394
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:34,080
If you want children, you have no choice but to get married

395
00:34:37,145 --> 00:34:38,999
What time does the conference start?

396
00:34:41,984 --> 00:34:42,724
Dr.

397
00:34:44,475 --> 00:34:47,475
No matter how many times you say, my answer is always the same

398
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,960
Please keep this a secret between you and me

399
00:34:54,150 --> 00:35:00,264
If you do that, what do you think will happen to the child?

400
00:35:01,676 --> 00:35:05,797
Are you saying that I slept with a guy and got pregnant?

401
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:07,106
That's right.

402
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,240
I don't care.

403
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,041
No matter what people say, I want my own child

404
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,551
I will do whatever it takes to protect my child's happiness.

405
00:35:18,321 --> 00:35:19,195
Please.

406
00:35:21,794 --> 00:35:23,907
That's no good.

407
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:48,655
I'm sorry for calling you here

408
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:49,882
Don't worry.

409
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:55,925
I often come here to watch fireworks to relax.

410
00:35:59,267 --> 00:35:59,947
Dr.

411
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:05,779
Are you still not giving up?

412
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:10,844
If I continue like this, I will be ruined

413
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:12,692
Why?

414
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,986
I have no hope of recovery other than giving birth to a child.

415
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:28,437
Something as simple as giving birth to a child makes me a real woman

416
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,260
That's our only hope of getting the painting back

417
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,943
But having a child doesn't necessarily mean

418
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:42,260
the way will open up.

419
00:36:42,603 --> 00:36:43,649
I know that.

420
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:49,445
Even if we can't return to the world of art, I think I can still live purely

421
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,720
Please.

422
00:36:54,154 --> 00:36:55,467
I'm in trouble.

423
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:46,113
Dr.

424
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:55,658
That's fine.

425
00:37:57,484 --> 00:37:59,426
Come tomorrow at 3 o'clock

426
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:08,919
Thank you for waiting

427
00:38:11,229 --> 00:38:12,593
Is the person today beautiful?

428
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:15,056
You're always thinking about that

429
00:38:20,964 --> 00:38:21,830
Hurry up.

430
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:29,342
What's wrong?

431
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,092
I decided to quit.

432
00:38:34,005 --> 00:38:34,732
You decided to quit?

433
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:40,742
Even if I upset Professor Yatabe, I can't take it anymore

434
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:42,715
Don't lose your temper

435
00:38:43,893 --> 00:38:47,494
However, for me, it means that my biggest rival will take a step forward

436
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,627
Don't get serious.

437
00:39:24,932 --> 00:39:25,932
You haven't done it?

438
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:27,771
Is she Takano?

439
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Why are you so worried about Takano-san?

440
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:33,003
I'm big fan of her.

441
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:34,103
fan?

442
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:37,723
I've loved her paintings since I was in high school

443
00:39:37,813 --> 00:39:39,114
What a strange person you are.

444
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,785
What's wrong with her?

445
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,050
She's single, so there's no way she's pregnant

446
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,802
But apparently she wants kids.

447
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:50,295
Is she here for artificial insemination?

448
00:39:51,245 --> 00:39:52,151
I don't know.

449
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:53,762
I'm sure you know.

450
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,229
She is here for artificial insemination after all

451
00:40:04,278 --> 00:40:04,838
No?

452
00:40:06,371 --> 00:40:08,008
I don't know, so hurry up

453
00:40:57,736 --> 00:40:58,276
Ok.

454
00:41:40,237 --> 00:41:42,103
Just to be clear,

455
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:48,810
the donors were selected to be two healthy people
with normal blood sugar levels and clear minds

456
00:41:50,297 --> 00:41:54,017
We do not know which sperm was used.

457
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:59,675
Please be aware that you will never know who the provider is,

458
00:43:24,938 --> 00:43:27,514
Please rest for one more hour.

459
00:43:27,539 --> 00:43:29,402
When will we know the results?

460
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,115
It will be clear after a month.

461
00:43:45,739 --> 00:43:50,569
I can have child of my own in a month.

462
00:43:52,023 --> 00:43:53,283
I can have child of my own.

463
00:45:21,849 --> 00:45:22,749
I was surprised

464
00:45:23,112 --> 00:45:23,909
What happened?

465
00:45:24,061 --> 00:45:27,243
I was waiting for you .
I have something to say

466
00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:29,698
I honestly don't know about that story.

467
00:45:29,851 --> 00:45:30,698
Anyway, please come

468
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,973
Do you really love me?

469
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,253
Yes.

470
00:46:18,492 --> 00:46:19,672
I'm glad.

471
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,631
someone might come.
Let's go backyard.

472
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:39,759
May I ask you something?

473
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:41,770
What?

474
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,890
I wonder which one was used today.

475
00:46:46,664 --> 00:46:48,131
I guess that's what it was about

476
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:53,780
Please, which one was used, mine or Satoru's?

477
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,813
If I knew that, I'd be satisfied

478
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,636
There's no way you could know that.

479
00:46:58,733 --> 00:46:59,823
Please remember that.

480
00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:03,870
Didn't you see the damage to the B sedge?

481
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:07,930
Well then, mine was used?

482
00:47:09,245 --> 00:47:11,598
No, I can't say that.

483
00:47:32,381 --> 00:47:33,195
You.

484
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:37,630
You wanted to know about it so You did this,didn't you?

485
00:47:38,382 --> 00:47:39,342
Don't get me wrong.

486
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,226
If only you knew that, you'd be satisfied

487
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:44,142
Of course

488
00:47:44,662 --> 00:47:45,862
Are you sure?

489
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:46,593
Yes.

490
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,103
Can I believe you?

491
00:47:49,434 --> 00:47:49,954
Yeah.

492
00:47:53,504 --> 00:47:54,964
Yours was used.

493
00:48:00,613 --> 00:48:02,126
Hug me.

494
00:48:12,511 --> 00:48:16,415
I can't wait for the next 15 days. Sorry

495
00:48:20,752 --> 00:48:21,452
I’m sorry.

496
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:22,851
What's the hell?

497
00:48:24,636 --> 00:48:28,748
Please draw soon.
My dad is getting irritated.

498
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:35,254
Gofu is there?

499
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:42,199
Do you have any sugars?

500
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,612
I have some.

501
00:48:46,009 --> 00:48:51,376
Is this modern art magazine?
Are you interested in modern art or something?

502
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:54,555
There was someone I knew on magazine

503
00:48:57,521 --> 00:49:00,261
Wanna come to have a tea?

504
00:49:00,722 --> 00:49:01,495
I'll see you later.

505
00:49:30,984 --> 00:49:31,764
Dr.

506
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,931
I should probably say congratulations

507
00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:47,100
There is nothing in particular to note

508
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,916
I don't know anything about the father either.

509
00:49:51,003 --> 00:49:52,297
Thank you

510
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:54,846
Take care.

511
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:05,128
I look very beautiful today.

512
00:51:06,359 --> 00:51:08,215
Beautiful, like a cleansed soul.

513
00:51:14,437 --> 00:51:19,166
A child of God, I may have been reborn.

514
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,126
Hello.

515
00:51:25,473 --> 00:51:26,406
You came early..

516
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,751
I got a sudden call so I rushed over

517
00:51:29,113 --> 00:51:31,326
I think it would be better to tell you this.

518
00:51:31,531 --> 00:51:32,518
What can I do for you?

519
00:51:33,121 --> 00:51:35,068
I am having a baby.

520
00:51:37,384 --> 00:51:38,490
Please don't tease me.

521
00:51:39,078 --> 00:51:39,858
It's true.

522
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,083
My baby?

523
00:51:43,472 --> 00:51:45,389
Well then,  what you'd do if it is your child?

524
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:47,346
I'm getting married

525
00:51:48,852 --> 00:51:50,286
But It's not your child

526
00:51:51,499 --> 00:51:53,925
So, after all, Hosokawa's?
He's such a worthless novelist.

527
00:51:54,391 --> 00:51:55,573
No either.

528
00:51:55,805 --> 00:51:56,431
Who's?

529
00:51:56,657 --> 00:51:58,810
No, he's anybody's child

530
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:00,563
This is no time for jokes

531
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:05,644
What on earth are you planning to do by causing
a stupid scandal at such a critical time?

532
00:52:07,911 --> 00:52:09,538
What are you going to do?

533
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:16,742
What's wrong?

534
00:52:17,307 --> 00:52:21,403
I've been working with you for four years.

535
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,593
Aren't you being a bit harsh towards me?

536
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:27,565
But you should have paid it back

537
00:52:29,036 --> 00:52:30,213
Who is the real father?

538
00:52:30,873 --> 00:52:31,833
I don't know .

539
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:33,650
You don't know?

540
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,704
You don't know whose child it is, but is that okay?

541
00:52:37,125 --> 00:52:38,418
But it's my child.

542
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:39,910
He's my only child.

543
00:52:41,048 --> 00:52:42,111
Are you serious?

544
00:52:42,272 --> 00:52:43,125
Yes.

545
00:52:45,226 --> 00:52:46,962
I didn't think you were that kind of girl

546
00:52:46,987 --> 00:52:48,351
I'll despise you.

547
00:52:48,654 --> 00:52:51,644
That's fine. Well then,
goodbye.

548
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:18,881
What are you talking about?

549
00:53:22,218 --> 00:53:23,071
Sorry.

550
00:53:26,292 --> 00:53:27,252
Hi, It's Hosokawa.

551
00:53:28,423 --> 00:53:29,543
Oh you.

552
00:53:30,169 --> 00:53:32,815
It's been a while, what happened to you?

553
00:53:34,292 --> 00:53:34,925
What?

554
00:53:35,723 --> 00:53:38,056
I'm having a baby.

555
00:53:40,372 --> 00:53:41,310
Really?

556
00:53:43,598 --> 00:53:44,904
That's good for you.

557
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:47,117
It's up to you.

558
00:53:51,007 --> 00:53:52,200
I will not force you to abort your baby.

559
00:53:53,471 --> 00:53:55,865
Don't worry.
He's not your child.

560
00:53:57,670 --> 00:54:01,595
Well then, Hosokawa-san, goodbye and write a good novel

561
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,160
Hey, hey Aiko.

562
00:54:12,976 --> 00:54:13,996
what a strange woman.

563
00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:28,510
What's wrong with you?
Aiko Takano's works are all old works.

564
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:31,010
I asked her to paint but...

565
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:33,926
but she couldn't make it

566
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:34,723
She's here.

567
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,569
hello. Thank you for coming.

568
00:54:38,838 --> 00:54:40,171
You look little losing your weighting.

569
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:42,011
By the way, your face looks pale.

570
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:45,214
I'm sorry I haven't been able to draw much
so I've only been working on my old work

571
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,617
Please take your time.

572
00:54:46,837 --> 00:54:47,451
Please.

573
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:51,699
Come with me,Tajima.

574
00:54:56,574 --> 00:54:59,085
Hey, you know, I just had a baby

575
00:55:01,829 --> 00:55:02,736
Is it my child?

576
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,859
Please keep it a secret from my father

577
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:14,138
I have to consider aborting it.

578
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,446
How much you need?

579
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,784
Don't worry.

580
00:55:19,017 --> 00:55:20,370
He's not your baby.

581
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:25,381
Is that true?

582
00:55:25,602 --> 00:55:26,622
Yes.

583
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,367
Who is Dad?

584
00:55:35,825 --> 00:55:36,745
God

585
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:38,138
God?

586
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:40,088
That's terrible.

587
00:55:45,966 --> 00:55:47,166
Murakami's?

588
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:48,539
or Hosokawa-san?

589
00:55:55,428 --> 00:55:56,142
I’m sorry.

590
00:55:56,448 --> 00:55:57,255
It's fine

591
00:56:18,233 --> 00:56:19,665
His growth is going well.

592
00:56:21,034 --> 00:56:22,526
Thank you very much.

593
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,990
Do you really have no regrets at all?

594
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:27,479
Not at all.

595
00:56:28,712 --> 00:56:32,166
The vague feeling I had before has completely cleared up

596
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:38,268
And now I feel very important to myself

597
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:42,987
That's good. Your artwork is progressing well

598
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:46,835
So, I have your own ideas,

599
00:56:46,860 --> 00:56:49,860
but I can't decide on the composition.

600
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:54,630
But I will definitely finish it by the time of the exhibition

601
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,815
You are a strong-minded person. Please show me your work if you finish it

602
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:04,760
I'll invite you.

603
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:15,276
Oh?

604
00:57:19,676 --> 00:57:21,916
Are you student in the Faculty of Medicine here?

605
00:57:22,479 --> 00:57:24,448
No, I am a student of the Faculty of Literature.

606
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,026
I  have a bit of a cold.

607
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,182
You have quite a few clippings of me

608
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:33,584
I am a fan of you.

609
00:57:35,302 --> 00:57:37,194
why you ran away other day?

610
00:57:38,596 --> 00:57:39,315
I'm sorry.

611
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:42,056
I'm suddenly feeling a bit off

612
00:57:42,081 --> 00:57:43,244
Are you going to see a doctor now?

613
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:44,464
No I've done it.

614
00:57:45,110 --> 00:57:47,338
So for a little while, can you stay with me?

615
00:57:47,888 --> 00:57:50,888
I want to go for a drive with you

616
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:52,370
Sure.

617
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:17,621
Sato-san, I have a request

618
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:20,026
I'll do anything I can

619
00:58:20,456 --> 00:58:21,987
Be my model

620
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:23,628
Model?

621
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,700
I really need a model for my next artwork.

622
00:58:28,357 --> 00:58:30,018
If it's okay with me, I'd be happy.

623
00:58:30,971 --> 00:58:32,018
Thank you.

624
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,096
But can I do it?

625
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:35,886
It has to be you.

626
00:58:52,804 --> 00:58:53,963
Now try standing up

627
00:58:58,385 --> 00:59:00,049
Can you turn to the side?

628
00:59:02,698 --> 00:59:06,643
Please raise both hands and lower your right hand.

629
00:59:08,831 --> 00:59:10,003
Yes,that's it.

630
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:18,276
Can I talk?

631
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,106
Okay, but don't move

632
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:26,096
You've certainly never drawn about a man, have you?

633
00:59:26,493 --> 00:59:28,940
Yeah, it's the first time for me

634
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,691
What kind of painting is it?

635
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:32,399
I can't tell you until it's finished.

636
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:33,768
Why?

637
00:59:34,081 --> 00:59:35,050
I can't.

638
00:59:36,271 --> 00:59:36,979
I want to see it.

639
00:59:37,004 --> 00:59:37,971
Don't move.

640
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,280
Why did you choose someone like me as a model?

641
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:48,428
I just can't understand it.

642
00:59:49,678 --> 00:59:52,274
You're naive, and strong.

643
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,241
Anyway, you are wonderful.

644
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:57,893
Satoru-san is popular with girls, right?

645
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:01,127
Why do you ask that?

646
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:03,518
I want to know more about you.

647
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:06,932
Why?

648
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:11,740
I can't help it.
Is that bad?

649
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:13,315
It's not bad but..

650
01:00:14,065 --> 01:00:15,323
Don't move.

651
01:00:24,432 --> 01:00:25,120
Well...

652
01:00:25,643 --> 01:00:26,182
What?

653
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:31,139
Would it be okay if I visited you from time to time after the work is completed?

654
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:34,867
Of course, are you tired?

655
01:00:35,753 --> 01:00:36,573
Let's take a little rest

656
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:37,758
Yes.

657
01:00:43,797 --> 01:00:44,569
I want to see it.

658
01:00:44,784 --> 01:00:45,839
Not yet.

659
01:00:57,145 --> 01:00:58,587
I think it was the first time I met you

660
01:00:59,783 --> 01:01:01,323
It was at Tajima Gallery.

661
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:04,370
No, I met you once before.

662
01:01:05,727 --> 01:01:08,727
I wonder where it was.

663
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:10,995
in the hospital corridor.

664
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:14,854
Are you really a literature major?

665
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,042
Yes I am.

666
01:01:25,977 --> 01:01:27,619
When I'm doing this,

667
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:30,644
I feel like I've known Sato-san for a long time

668
01:01:34,193 --> 01:01:36,315
So when will it be completed?

669
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:39,636
 I don't know

670
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:42,799
Are you getting tired of it?

671
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,104
No way.
Now I am happy to have someone draw for me.

672
01:01:51,490 --> 01:01:53,346
When I hear people say that it makes me happy,

673
01:01:54,180 --> 01:01:56,516
I want to say that I want to draw more and more

674
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:59,924
You must be tired after working all day today. Let's stop here

675
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:01,862
No, I'm fine with it

676
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:04,283
I don't mind standing up until the morning without sleeping

677
01:02:04,323 --> 01:02:07,323
If you say we'll stay together till the morning, I won't be able to keep it up

678
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:18,838
What's the matter?

679
01:02:24,651 --> 01:02:25,925
 I'm busy

680
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:28,815
Are you busy with her model?

681
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:32,862
if you don't need me, I'll go home.

682
01:02:32,995 --> 01:02:34,839
Wait.
We haven't finished talking yet.

683
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,619
It wasn't you who was used by Takano-san

684
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,440
It was Satoru-san's.

685
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:49,246
What are you saying now?

686
01:02:49,270 --> 01:02:53,616
You clearly stated at the time
that the damaged pipe was used

687
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:54,966
You were so crazy about it.

688
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:56,432
I thought you would be happy if I said that.

689
01:02:56,457 --> 01:02:57,175
I can't believe it.

690
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,549
You're trying to get revenge on me?

691
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:02,753
but you don't deserve it.

692
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:10,627
I was wrong, I may have used you

693
01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:13,619
But that doesn't mean there wasn't love

694
01:03:14,201 --> 01:03:15,752
It's true that I loved you

695
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:22,135
You may not understand what I'm saying now,

696
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:23,870
but please at least hear me.

697
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,994
It was after I heard from you that mine was used

698
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:31,338
 I couldn't even understand started happening.

699
01:03:32,182 --> 01:03:34,495
but It was used by Satoru's.

700
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,776
I wonder what will happen to your love

701
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:40,877
Please don't say such cruel things, tell me the truth.

702
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:47,557
Ozu, I never had any hope of becoming your wife.

703
01:03:48,390 --> 01:03:51,390
But I can't stand being used by you.

704
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:56,987
At first, I thought I would confess what I did to Yasaka-sensei and Takano-san and get revenge on you

705
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,979
But when I think about it, it seems foolish to perish with you

706
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:03,026
That's why I called you

707
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,846
Whatever you want to do is up to you,

708
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:10,057
but at the very least, you'll have to give up on Takano-san

709
01:04:13,090 --> 01:04:13,823
Well then, goodbye.

710
01:04:36,409 --> 01:04:40,214
students, students, wake up

711
01:06:03,307 --> 01:06:05,940
Stop it. It's my child,

712
01:06:08,253 --> 01:06:09,628
it's my child.

713
01:06:10,471 --> 01:06:11,128
help me.

714
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:13,237
it's my child.

715
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:15,971
Help me.

716
01:06:24,628 --> 01:06:25,893
help me

717
01:07:34,667 --> 01:07:38,065
Ozu? Takano is calling you.

718
01:07:41,237 --> 01:07:43,393
What happened Satoru?

719
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:47,040
You know there aren't many days left until the exhibition

720
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:48,588
I'm going

721
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:52,206
Yes, I'll be there right away

722
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:05,630
It wasn't yours who used it then

723
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:22,073
That's a lie

724
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:24,479
That's a lie

725
01:08:26,628 --> 01:08:29,128
That's a lie!
That's a lie!

726
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:31,440
What's wrong Satoru-san?

727
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:35,768
What on earth happened today?

728
01:08:36,789 --> 01:08:37,791
Are you tired?

729
01:08:37,816 --> 01:08:39,042
I'm alright.

730
01:08:39,464 --> 01:08:40,534
Excuse me.

731
01:08:40,799 --> 01:08:42,460
I told you not to come in while I was working

732
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,920
But Hosokawa is here.

733
01:08:48,769 --> 01:08:50,097
Hey.

734
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:51,526
what are you doing here?

735
01:08:51,551 --> 01:08:53,292
I came to visit you because you're pregnant.

736
01:08:57,405 --> 01:08:59,081
I guess it's true after all.

737
01:08:59,546 --> 01:09:01,514
I'm at work. Please go home

738
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:07,198
Well, don't say that,
I'm the kid's father

739
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:14,346
Are you still saying that? I want to have children

740
01:09:15,310 --> 01:09:19,424
So I did the artificial insemination. It has nothing to do with you

741
01:09:19,764 --> 01:09:21,956
No, definitely He's my child.

742
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,284
Go home

743
01:09:23,886 --> 01:09:24,479
No.

744
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,706
Anyway, please go home

745
01:09:26,753 --> 01:09:28,135
Don't get in the way of my work.

746
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:30,433
Work?

747
01:09:32,214 --> 01:09:34,448
You just draw nonsense.

748
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:36,737
What kind of work is that?

749
01:09:37,245 --> 01:09:38,253
Go home

750
01:09:38,831 --> 01:09:40,229
I don't wanna see your face anymore.

751
01:09:42,170 --> 01:09:43,041
What?

752
01:09:46,998 --> 01:09:47,807
What's the hell who you are?

753
01:10:37,063 --> 01:10:38,081
I'm sorry

754
01:10:43,705 --> 01:10:44,713
That's fine.

755
01:10:49,956 --> 01:10:51,300
Thank you.

756
01:10:57,183 --> 01:11:00,128
Satoru-san, This is not good idea.

757
01:11:02,628 --> 01:11:03,425
Look at this.

758
01:11:07,953 --> 01:11:10,135
Title is Virgin Conception.

759
01:11:11,456 --> 01:11:13,636
She got pregnant as a virgin

760
01:11:15,192 --> 01:11:17,189
The father is a young man

761
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,862
He is her ideal man.

762
01:11:22,964 --> 01:11:25,573
So she looks very happy.

763
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:34,362
With this work, I want to express that young women today have lost sight of their ideal.

764
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:41,410
Not my child, not my child.

765
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:45,534
That's dirty.

766
01:11:45,753 --> 01:11:46,690
Virgin Conception?

767
01:11:46,909 --> 01:11:48,770
It is much better in previous drawings.

768
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,885
It's dirty, everyone is dirty

769
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,463
What are you talking about?

770
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,933
Would you be happy to give birth to anyone's child?

771
01:11:58,979 --> 01:12:00,003
Tell me.

772
01:12:03,237 --> 01:12:04,995
What are you going to do with me?

773
01:12:05,417 --> 01:12:06,362
Stop it....

774
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,134
It's unfortunate, but it was unavoidable

775
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:24,010
This may have been God's providence

776
01:15:25,700 --> 01:15:29,499
It may seem cruel, but I think this was better for you

777
01:15:31,939 --> 01:15:37,310
Next time, I will take care of you as you give birth to your child in the natural way

778
01:15:39,677 --> 01:15:41,117
Cheer up.

779
01:15:44,590 --> 01:15:46,036
As soon as the hospital room is ready

780
01:15:46,060 --> 01:15:47,124
I'll take you there.

781
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,258
Please turn off the lights.

782
01:16:06,050 --> 01:16:11,265
This may have been God's providence

783
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:47,695
I feel sorry for Takano-san, but I'm glad she had an abortion.

784
01:17:43,019 --> 01:17:44,495
I'm sorry.

785
01:17:53,636 --> 01:17:54,659
 please forgive me

786
01:18:23,248 --> 01:18:24,389
She scared me.

787
01:18:25,758 --> 01:18:27,570
What a strange person.

788
01:18:27,778 --> 01:18:29,255
She couldn't paint that much

789
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,026
How did she manage to get out of it?

790
01:18:31,058 --> 01:18:35,136
I never expected her to bounce back so well.

791
01:18:47,940 --> 01:18:49,221
So thank you very much.

792
01:18:49,276 --> 01:18:50,440
Thanks.

793
01:18:51,924 --> 01:18:53,073
Congratulations.

794
01:18:53,727 --> 01:18:57,111
You're doing a great job, I really respect you

795
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,560
Thank you for coming all the way

796
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:03,932
No matter what you put down, I come right away

797
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:08,190
Being a model isn't a good feeling when the paint is completed

798
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:12,119
Well, I don't like violence

799
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:15,081
Please go there, Takano.

800
01:19:15,442 --> 01:19:17,440
Excuse me.

801
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:25,190
I heard that your fertilizer.

802
01:19:25,937 --> 01:19:26,891
What is it?

803
01:19:27,469 --> 01:19:28,773
It's a manure.

804
01:19:30,547 --> 01:19:31,516
What do you mean?

805
01:19:32,912 --> 01:19:34,163
You know? that woman...

806
01:19:34,867 --> 01:19:40,756
She gives out sweet nectar to attract men.
And she makes that man into fertilizer.

807
01:19:41,773 --> 01:19:42,990
She's a woman like that.

808
01:19:46,264 --> 01:19:47,366
This is awesome.

809
01:19:47,413 --> 01:19:49,483
Is that so? Thank you

810
01:19:51,845 --> 01:19:57,490
What a good mood!
The victims are pitiful.

811
01:20:00,030 --> 01:20:03,030
You probably won't understand now

812
01:20:04,070 --> 01:20:07,070
Once I was her fertilizer

813
01:20:07,170 --> 01:20:08,954
I couldn't really believe it though.

814
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:14,132
You should be careful.

815
01:20:15,406 --> 01:20:17,598
It's fine as long as your fertilizer is working

816
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,760
But once it's not working, she easily discard you.

817
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,584
I can't stand to see an innocent young man like you get hurt

818
01:20:28,686 --> 01:20:29,389
Look.

819
01:20:30,347 --> 01:20:32,073
She seems triumphant.

820
01:20:35,358 --> 01:20:37,038
Are you upset?

821
01:20:38,051 --> 01:20:45,499
Well, if you don't like my advice, you'll be her fertilizer for the rest of your life

822
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:54,100
Damn it.

823
01:20:55,167 --> 01:20:57,020
I'm not fertilizer.

824
01:20:59,069 --> 01:21:00,632
What are you going to do?

825
01:21:02,546 --> 01:21:05,553
What are you doing?
Stop it....

826
01:21:17,014 --> 01:21:19,342
Are you alright?

827
01:21:26,139 --> 01:21:27,546
Why did you do this?

828
01:21:41,444 --> 01:21:42,733
Satoru!

829
01:21:56,443 --> 01:22:05,787
THE END

3
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:45,613
Eat it.
It's delicious.Here you go.

4
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,746
Here you go.

5
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:55,522
Here's your tea

6
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:03,022
They are fighting.
Come here

7
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:08,724
leave them alone.

8
00:02:11,294 --> 00:02:14,880
They are annoying me

9
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:17,728
Don't look at them

10
00:02:18,415 --> 00:02:20,142
Get hands off of me

11
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:20,938
You hit me

12
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:22,517
You are rooster

13
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,345
You are hen

14
00:02:25,009 --> 00:02:25,446
Wait

15
00:02:25,471 --> 00:02:27,252
Your math score is 50

16
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,242
Don't start a fight this early in the morning.

17
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,568
Stop play with her

18
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,873
She told me my math score was just 50

19
00:02:44,495 --> 00:02:47,214
Take a lesson from Akiko.

20
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:58,560
Mom

21
00:03:02,536 --> 00:03:04,154
I didn't know your were at home

22
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:06,935
I took the last train home.

23
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,224
aren't you sleepy after getting up so early?

24
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:13,810
I'm used to it.

25
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,654
Come in

26
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:27,486
You don't have to get up if you come home late.
I'll do it.

27
00:03:28,268 --> 00:03:30,549
You don't have to worry about that.

28
00:03:32,949 --> 00:03:39,777
I'm more concerned about my job as a hotel accountant,
I know it's a bit of a burden, but you'll have to put up with it.

29
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:46,121
In return, I'll do whatever it takes until you graduate from school, Aki-chan.

30
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:53,009
Everything until the day I graduate.
I'll do my best too

31
00:03:58,551 --> 00:04:03,231
And when I finish school, I'll work hard and make you happy, too.

32
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,410
I wonder If I can

33
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,277
Oh,I don't know what I'm supposed to do for homework.

34
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,839
I wonder if he's awake.

35
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,839
You're always beautiful.

36
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:20,253
Stop saying it

37
00:04:24,835 --> 00:04:29,257
You ask if it's okay to come in through the shoji.

38
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,764
I know.

39
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:41,728
Bros

40
00:04:55,898 --> 00:04:57,905
Who? Aki?

41
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,210
Yes,May I come in?

42
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,359
Come in

43
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,601
You're not up yet.

44
00:05:07,626 --> 00:05:08,984
Till 10 am

45
00:05:09,835 --> 00:05:13,898
Sleeping in in the morning is good for my mental

46
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:16,788
That is not good idea

47
00:05:17,452 --> 00:05:23,374
If you look at my shirt, you'll see filth.You see my socks, they're filthy. Now you think sleeping in is filthy?

48
00:05:24,085 --> 00:05:26,749
If you want to be a doctor, you can't be filthy.

49
00:05:27,069 --> 00:05:27,819
I see

50
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:32,890
You should brush your teeth first

51
00:05:34,507 --> 00:05:35,476
Again

52
00:05:35,726 --> 00:05:39,007
You know what?

53
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,801
Maybe I should stop calling you "brother" from now on.

54
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:48,934
Why?

55
00:05:49,504 --> 00:05:52,246
Because we're cousins.

56
00:05:52,637 --> 00:05:54,309
It's strange to call you brother

57
00:05:54,652 --> 00:05:55,582
How do you call me?

58
00:05:56,988 --> 00:05:58,004
Well

59
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:02,442
Mappe is fine

60
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,137
I'm sorry, I'm just calling you that behind your back.

61
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:10,469
I call you Mashita

62
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:11,469
Mashita?

63
00:06:13,727 --> 00:06:15,899
It's kind of weird, but I'll get used to it.

64
00:06:17,359 --> 00:06:18,055
Show me your homework

65
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,289
Yeah

66
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:22,473
Don't smoke it

67
00:06:24,653 --> 00:06:25,465
What's this

68
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:26,762
It's hard

69
00:06:27,043 --> 00:06:29,340
Get ready,Aki

70
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:30,575
You'll be late

71
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:51,610
Wait

72
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:09,962
That's good

73
00:07:11,814 --> 00:07:12,947
Guess what is this

74
00:07:13,275 --> 00:07:15,220
Please tell us

75
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:17,329
Look at this stat sheet

76
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,001
Yours?

77
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,697
This is Matsushita teacher's

78
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:29,055
She preaches to the girls roughly every twenty-seventh day according to this statistical table.

79
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:30,784
Oh yeah

80
00:07:31,268 --> 00:07:33,089
SO it means

81
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,682
So from today?

82
00:07:35,707 --> 00:07:38,222
Yes, we should be careful

83
00:07:38,737 --> 00:07:41,456
We have to prepare for it

84
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:44,425
I can't believe you are about to find out a secret about someone like that.

85
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:46,448
You think so?

86
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:49,463
Every woman has secrets.

87
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,495
Because it's filthy.

88
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:52,526
I don't think so.

89
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,964
What do you think, Masako?

90
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,854
It's ok.
And it's not like this statistic hurts Matsushita's authority.

91
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,182
I'm just trying to "scientifically analyze" her hysteria.

92
00:08:03,268 --> 00:08:05,526
You're right

93
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:11,737
I'm disgusted with you.
I'm her side

94
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:15,917
Such an investigation is perverse.

95
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:26,031
 Who let me do my homework and then gets all smug with his theories?

96
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,038
But this stat is..

97
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:28,874
Hey

98
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,671
Teacher

99
00:08:34,529 --> 00:08:38,498
How panicky are you?
You are like thieving cat

100
00:08:45,565 --> 00:08:47,995
Okay, everyone, please turn in your homework from yesterday.

101
00:08:54,905 --> 00:08:56,108
Imakura?

102
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,725
Thank you very much for earlier.

103
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,194
I'm so glad you were on my side.

104
00:09:07,219 --> 00:09:08,780
Yeah, I was angry, too.

105
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,944
I mean, how would they feel if they did that to you?

106
00:09:13,116 --> 00:09:14,288
I know.

107
00:09:16,717 --> 00:09:20,163
I was on my way to catch the train and I picked this up this morning.

108
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,530
Men's watch?

109
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:27,545
He's a college student.
I tried to give it to him. I was going to give you the nest, but the train left.

110
00:09:27,873 --> 00:09:30,889
So I think I'll wait at the stop tomorrow and give it to him.

111
00:09:31,202 --> 00:09:33,030
Oh, that's so romantic.

112
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:33,873
Why?

113
00:09:34,655 --> 00:09:38,811
You wait and the nobleman appears.

114
00:09:39,631 --> 00:09:41,733
And he holds your hands

115
00:09:41,758 --> 00:09:43,217
I hope so

116
00:09:43,772 --> 00:09:46,186
He's going to be your wonderful boyfriend.

117
00:09:46,592 --> 00:09:49,178
He's better than I am

118
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:56,342
 Have you decided on a research topic for your senior thesis?

119
00:09:57,272 --> 00:10:01,006
I've been working on it for a while.
I study eugenics in consanguineous marriages.

120
00:10:03,342 --> 00:10:05,116
How is it going?

121
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:07,748
I'd like to affirm that if I could.

122
00:10:07,944 --> 00:10:10,623
No personal feelings in academia

123
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:13,077
Why?

124
00:10:14,178 --> 00:10:18,194
You're thinking of your cousin Akiko, the high-schooler.

125
00:10:27,016 --> 00:10:28,969
How’s he?

126
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,751
It's good

127
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:34,118
It's good

128
00:10:34,143 --> 00:10:36,673
Second class?

129
00:10:43,552 --> 00:10:45,747
Your score is 7!

130
00:10:47,388 --> 00:10:48,474
He's shy

131
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:50,357
He's so pure

132
00:11:04,008 --> 00:11:06,070
Look at us

133
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,328
Your score is 4!

134
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:10,484
Your score is 2!

135
00:11:18,395 --> 00:11:19,098
Hi

136
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:22,315
Yamakawa.

137
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,191
I've been waiting for you?

138
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,184
What are you waiting for?

139
00:11:25,355 --> 00:11:27,020
You should go my home

140
00:11:28,282 --> 00:11:34,539
Actually, Mr. Yoshizawa, one of my seniors, is getting transferred to Osaka.I was invited to his farewell party.

141
00:11:34,836 --> 00:11:37,157
Yoshizawa is a member of the soccer team, right?

142
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,539
Isn't it an honor?

143
00:11:40,063 --> 00:11:43,711
Actually, I have to go with my partner.

144
00:11:45,422 --> 00:11:46,954
Will you go with me?

145
00:11:47,704 --> 00:11:50,016
Don't tell your mom

146
00:11:50,719 --> 00:11:55,469
I'll let your father know.
I will go with you

147
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,563
I'll give you one chance to do that, but you have to do what I say.

148
00:11:58,907 --> 00:12:02,485
I'll do anything.
I'll be waiting for you at the Prince's, so just get here as soon as you can.

149
00:12:11,383 --> 00:12:12,266
I'm home

150
00:12:24,926 --> 00:12:25,746
Welcome home.

151
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:31,191
I promised my friend and I that we would go to a party.

152
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,684
How about this?

153
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:33,465
When?

154
00:12:33,715 --> 00:12:34,590
From now

155
00:12:34,615 --> 00:12:34,973
You can't

156
00:12:35,363 --> 00:12:37,270
Why?

157
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:42,746
Your new tutor has come here

158
00:12:43,902 --> 00:12:45,261
I don't wanna study

159
00:12:45,566 --> 00:12:47,551
I made a promise

160
00:12:48,941 --> 00:12:51,215
Can I start from tomorrow?

161
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,691
He has come here all the way

162
00:12:55,043 --> 00:12:57,074
I'll go get you some tea.

163
00:12:58,253 --> 00:12:59,167
Come with me.

164
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:30,629
What are you doing?

165
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:44,923
Sorry to keep you waiting.
She's Natsuko.

166
00:13:46,477 --> 00:13:48,813
I'm Makito Miki

167
00:13:52,555 --> 00:13:56,274
I know you.
You are Akiko's cousin

168
00:13:58,618 --> 00:14:00,282
Oh you are

169
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:02,157
We are cousin

170
00:14:02,524 --> 00:14:03,290
That's a coincidence.

171
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,915
Please have a seat

172
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:10,509
That's why Akiko's grade is good.
I hope Natsuko s grade will be better

173
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,509
It's not easy

174
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:17,407
My mom always tell me to learn from Akiko

175
00:14:18,001 --> 00:14:20,337
She's the same as me when she's at home, isn't she?

176
00:14:22,055 --> 00:14:23,188
I have no idea

177
00:14:23,274 --> 00:14:25,235
That's what I thought

178
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,415
Forget it

179
00:14:59,621 --> 00:15:02,738
What's wrong,Yamakawa?

180
00:15:02,887 --> 00:15:04,613
Your partner has not come yet

181
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,785
She's coming soon

182
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,301
You were declined?

183
00:15:07,433 --> 00:15:08,090
No

184
00:15:08,301 --> 00:15:12,441
It's part of being in love.

185
00:15:12,581 --> 00:15:16,863
What are you doing?

186
00:15:17,909 --> 00:15:20,721
You're a bully.

187
00:15:27,007 --> 00:15:31,124
Cheer up.
Have a drink

188
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,663
Here you go

189
00:15:43,232 --> 00:15:52,552
Tangent line of the circumscribed circle at vertex A If we place...

190
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,896
It means 90 degree

191
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,037
Are you listening to me?

192
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:02,060
I've done something wrong.

193
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:04,287
Did you promise a party?

194
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:08,482
Because tonight is a very important part of my youth.

195
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:15,287
I wonder if life is more meaningful to you if you enjoy dancing or if you suffer through maths.

196
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,803
Well, let's discuss the meaning of life some other time, shall we?

197
00:16:20,123 --> 00:16:21,678
Look at this

198
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:24,280
You're not romanticist

199
00:16:26,663 --> 00:16:28,936
Have you ever been in love?

200
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,913
I've never been in love.

201
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,882
That's not good

202
00:16:35,335 --> 00:16:37,827
You're already 27

203
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:41,147
Anyone can fall in love, even if they don't want to.

204
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:43,678
But not mathematics.

205
00:16:44,366 --> 00:16:45,897
Look at this

206
00:16:54,688 --> 00:16:57,500
Take your clothes off

207
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,843
Water

208
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:24,915
You're cute

209
00:17:36,276 --> 00:17:36,932
I'm home

210
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,049
Welcome back.

211
00:17:39,214 --> 00:17:41,768
You're back late.
What kind of house did you get a part-time job at?

212
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:44,589
That's your friend Natsuko's house.

213
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:46,299
Natsuko's?

214
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:49,073
She's got a little kid, but he's pretty cute.

215
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:49,987
Yeah

216
00:17:52,862 --> 00:17:53,909
I bet you're hungry.

217
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,573
I ate there

218
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:08,257
Sorry I can't eat

219
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,515
Never mind.
Compared to the delicacies of a rich man's home, my cooking is nothing.

220
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,554
That's not what I meant.

221
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:15,366
It's okay.

222
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:18,851
You can't teach me about school anymore.

223
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:22,304
Why you say that?

224
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:25,882
You'll get a reward for teaching Natsuko.

225
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:29,257
This is my part time job

226
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,921
I'm fine with being alone.

227
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:36,103
You're stupid

228
00:20:01,439 --> 00:20:02,821
You got better?

229
00:20:03,923 --> 00:20:04,821
Where's here?

230
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,931
You're all drunk.

231
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:13,673
It was heavy, and I'm tired of coming all the way back here.

232
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:21,404
You have pretty eyes.

233
00:20:31,202 --> 00:20:32,976
Is the door locked?

234
00:20:35,657 --> 00:20:37,500
That door sometimes does that.

235
00:20:39,117 --> 00:20:40,547
It's too late

236
00:20:42,433 --> 00:20:44,175
Why don't you get the ashtray?

237
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:55,203
Take those matches, too.

238
00:21:06,026 --> 00:21:07,245
Thank you.

239
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:12,112
You know what

240
00:22:44,389 --> 00:22:46,858
Here's fine

241
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:19,768
Excuse me

242
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:23,836
You dropped this yesterday

243
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,141
I give up, thank you.

244
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:30,574
So you've been waiting for me all this time?

245
00:23:32,676 --> 00:23:39,027
Also parabola ikokko situation and straight line overhead to find the intersection of the parabola and the line

246
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:48,636
You can see this when you think about how we solve quadratic equations and how we solve quadratic equations from the intersection of a hyperbola equal to one and a straight line plus.

247
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:55,410
We can also represent proportional and linear relationships with straight lines and we can read the relationship.

248
00:23:56,066 --> 00:24:00,722
In this way, we can use our brains The calculations that are done by reading numerical values in this way are called diagrammatic calculations.

249
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,399
This watch is old-fashioned. But it's a precious memento of my father's.

250
00:24:09,985 --> 00:24:12,704
So your father is dead too?

251
00:24:14,649 --> 00:24:18,829
My father died when I was seven.

252
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,845
That's a coincidence.

253
00:24:22,618 --> 00:24:25,993
I'm starting to miss my father

254
00:24:26,837 --> 00:24:28,110
So do I

255
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:32,407
You'd have to be in the same situation to understand how I feel.

256
00:24:37,828 --> 00:24:38,977
Go ahead.

257
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:43,948
Go ahead.

258
00:25:07,288 --> 00:25:10,811
I have a flat right here, why don't you come by?

259
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:12,006
But

260
00:25:13,366 --> 00:25:17,295
It wouldn't be good to be found here with your friend.

261
00:25:18,334 --> 00:25:22,482
I'm sorry to have to say goodbye, so why don't you come in?

262
00:25:28,545 --> 00:25:29,475
Come in

263
00:25:43,429 --> 00:25:45,109
Have a seat

264
00:25:49,096 --> 00:25:50,128
Shall I make you some tea?

265
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:51,737
I will

266
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,026
Don't worry

267
00:25:53,401 --> 00:25:55,096
Ok thanks

268
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:42,695
Akiko

269
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:17,172
You get angry?

270
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:29,782
Come again

271
00:28:40,027 --> 00:28:42,105
This is so great

272
00:28:42,574 --> 00:28:43,862
How's this?

273
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,621
it looks good

274
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,472
I'm glad you like it

275
00:28:49,634 --> 00:28:50,759
Is this ok?

276
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:47,585
I've come on a sudden business trip  so tell AKIKO about us as soon as you can.

277
00:29:47,976 --> 00:29:51,703
By the time you get back.

278
00:29:52,843 --> 00:29:55,851
So I can't give you this until then?

279
00:29:57,508 --> 00:30:00,804
She's a sensitive girl.

280
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:09,492
You've been struggling to raise her on your own for so long,I'm afraid to be her dad

281
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:15,812
She really needs a father from now on.

282
00:30:32,543 --> 00:30:33,590
Yamakawa

283
00:30:36,147 --> 00:30:36,842
Yamakawa

284
00:30:58,728 --> 00:30:59,877
You always sleep

285
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:03,471
Would you go into a man's room unannounced at any time?

286
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,525
Because even if I woke you up, you wouldn't wake up.

287
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:13,951
What are you doing here?

288
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:19,568
I came to apologise for breaking my promise yesterday.

289
00:31:24,228 --> 00:31:25,329
You're angry.

290
00:31:28,228 --> 00:31:29,579
I missed school because of it.

291
00:31:31,282 --> 00:31:32,509
It's too late

292
00:31:33,181 --> 00:31:35,118
Don't say that.

293
00:31:36,595 --> 00:31:39,946
I bought your favourite chocolate.

294
00:31:41,071 --> 00:31:42,001
I won't eat it.

295
00:31:56,459 --> 00:31:58,185
Since when do you smoke?

296
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:04,260
I'm not kids

297
00:32:07,682 --> 00:32:09,659
You've changed a lot, haven't you?

298
00:32:10,573 --> 00:32:11,760
It's none of your business.

299
00:32:12,753 --> 00:32:14,503
Stop it,Yamakawa.

300
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:21,276
If you do that, it'll be bad for your father who got transferred.

301
00:32:25,037 --> 00:32:26,014
What the hell?

302
00:32:35,006 --> 00:32:36,303
Stop it

303
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:47,979
I'm done with you.

304
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:56,075
Here you go

305
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:08,540
Here you go

306
00:33:10,118 --> 00:33:10,946
Bros

307
00:33:17,324 --> 00:33:20,636
Are you alright?

308
00:33:25,534 --> 00:33:26,316
I'm home.

309
00:33:26,341 --> 00:33:27,363
Welcome home

310
00:33:27,784 --> 00:33:30,378
Welcome home,math score 50

311
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,324
You are mean

312
00:33:35,777 --> 00:33:36,761
I'm sorry I said that.

313
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,542
Let's get back on track and study.

314
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,574
No...

315
00:35:05,252 --> 00:35:08,728
I have a flat right here, why don't you come by?

316
00:35:11,877 --> 00:35:12,760
You get angry?

317
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:16,268
Come again

318
00:36:04,981 --> 00:36:06,613
Why don't you just come in?

319
00:36:08,254 --> 00:36:09,410
You get wet

320
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:33,954
I was hoping you might come by.

321
00:36:35,798 --> 00:36:36,884
Go on, wipe up.

322
00:36:39,528 --> 00:36:40,731
It's raining suddenly.

323
00:36:46,583 --> 00:36:50,692
Take off your clothes and put this on for a while.

324
00:37:46,797 --> 00:37:50,024
Try this.
It'll warm you up and give you energy.

325
00:39:35,046 --> 00:39:38,835
You can't. Escape from here

326
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:42,834
You can't. Escape from here

327
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:53,643
Escape from here

328
00:39:54,377 --> 00:39:56,619
Escape from here

329
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,331
I thought you were the one who came in.

330
00:41:13,224 --> 00:41:14,982
Come again

331
00:41:46,513 --> 00:41:47,740
Where have you been?

332
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,728
Aki

333
00:41:55,587 --> 00:41:56,150
Aki

334
00:42:08,995 --> 00:42:09,683
Aki

335
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:11,745
Aki

336
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:58,583
I'm enjoying my time here.

337
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:16,534
How is it with him who dropped watch?

338
00:43:17,308 --> 00:43:18,370
How's he?

339
00:43:26,727 --> 00:43:28,438
She's putting on her makeup.?

340
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:31,899
I'm disgusted with her

341
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:34,016
Is she insane?

342
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:37,024
Yes she is

343
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,008
What do you mean?

344
00:43:39,258 --> 00:43:41,352
Ask your teacher

345
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:13,549
Open page 42

346
00:44:47,998 --> 00:44:49,568
Shut up

347
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:52,443
Teacher

348
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:57,506
What do you mean about Ikamono?

349
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:00,600
Ikamono?

350
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,797
Person like me

351
00:45:26,051 --> 00:45:27,066
Welcome home.

352
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:29,685
I'm home

353
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,794
I was just leaving.

354
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,529
I made your favourite oshiruko.

355
00:45:37,747 --> 00:45:43,224
And, ...
I'd like to talk to you.

356
00:46:06,148 --> 00:46:07,414
Natsuko

357
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:12,492
Has studying become more interesting since you've been tutored?

358
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,851
Yeah, I'm thinking about going to med school and becoming a doctor.
I'm like a second Madame Curie.

359
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:19,195
Madame Curie.?

360
00:46:19,390 --> 00:46:28,585
But now we have penicillin.
I wonder if there's anything left for me to study.

361
00:46:28,812 --> 00:46:31,453
It's not Treasure hunts.

362
00:46:31,554 --> 00:46:32,867
Really

363
00:46:35,389 --> 00:46:41,694
I'm taking the kids to a friend's ranch this holiday. I'm going hiking with the kids to a friend's ranch.

364
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:43,663
Why don't you come with us?

365
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:47,296
Yes, take Akiko with us

366
00:46:47,530 --> 00:46:50,546
She's very depressed today.

367
00:46:50,749 --> 00:46:51,772
Really?

368
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:01,884
I'm home

369
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:06,657
Are you studying?

370
00:47:08,009 --> 00:47:11,142
Why don't we go hiking with Natsuko next Sun?

371
00:47:11,767 --> 00:47:14,095
It would be better if it was just the two of you?

372
00:47:15,173 --> 00:47:16,298
You’re stupid

373
00:47:26,524 --> 00:47:29,531
Natsuko invites you

374
00:47:30,188 --> 00:47:32,289
She's worried about you, too.

375
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:38,531
I worry about you, too.

376
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:51,061
I don't know what you're worried about.
If you have something to say to your mother, you can say it to me.

377
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:56,946
If it's wrong for me to go to Natsuko's, it's fine with me.

378
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,108
Yes, I've been naughty since I was little, and I used to make you cry.

379
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:18,522
But now I don't want to make you cry.

380
00:48:22,977 --> 00:48:28,782
Girls are supposed to be crybabies.
You're a little too whiny.

381
00:49:11,179 --> 00:49:17,382
I'll just forget about it.
I'll just pretend it was a bad dream.

382
00:49:18,112 --> 00:49:21,378
I'll just forget about it.

383
00:50:18,222 --> 00:50:21,730
You get used to riding.
Wanna run?

384
00:50:22,511 --> 00:50:24,941
I can't.
I will fall down

385
00:50:25,574 --> 00:50:27,925
I'm so nerves

386
00:50:31,125 --> 00:50:33,094
What a nice view

387
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:40,767
I wanna go there

388
00:50:41,025 --> 00:50:42,416
Let me see your technique

389
00:50:42,580 --> 00:50:44,478
You can go first

390
00:50:44,807 --> 00:50:46,939
Let's race

391
00:50:47,963 --> 00:50:50,111
we are waiting there

392
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,833
Wait for me!

393
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:41,133
You're too fast

394
00:51:41,274 --> 00:51:42,485
We are racing

395
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:43,938
I give up

396
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,602
Let's take a rest

397
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,250
Put me down.

398
00:52:13,010 --> 00:52:14,854
Take me there.

399
00:52:20,748 --> 00:52:22,404
You are too heavy

400
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,686
I'm 50kg

401
00:52:23,826 --> 00:52:25,209
You're 55 kg

402
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:31,501
I’ll do like this

403
00:52:33,774 --> 00:52:34,868
Hold on

404
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:39,126
The sky is nice

405
00:52:39,227 --> 00:52:40,672
Oh, it's beautiful.

406
00:52:41,602 --> 00:52:43,657
I feel like I'm dreaming.

407
00:52:53,317 --> 00:52:55,551
I take a revenge

408
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:06,234
Stop it

409
00:53:40,896 --> 00:53:43,474
I wish you were my brother.

410
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:47,302
I don't want to be such a naughty sister.

411
00:53:47,732 --> 00:53:49,724
Am I?

412
00:53:49,802 --> 00:53:51,888
I guess I am shy

413
00:54:09,488 --> 00:54:10,410
Aki

414
00:54:12,809 --> 00:54:13,730
Aki

415
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:29,683
Oh you are here

416
00:54:29,926 --> 00:54:34,308
It felt so good, I flew too far.
Natsuko wait for you there.

417
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:35,918
Let's go

418
00:54:42,049 --> 00:54:44,190
You're so stupid, like a child.

419
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:50,706
Something's worrying you, Aki-chan.

420
00:54:55,061 --> 00:54:57,038
Maybe you're worried about Ueda-san.

421
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:03,374
We're all worried about you.

422
00:55:03,858 --> 00:55:06,874
Don't worry about me.

423
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:09,179
Stupid

424
00:55:21,425 --> 00:55:22,792
What's wrong?

425
00:55:25,261 --> 00:55:27,511
Aki-chan has changed completely.

426
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,783
It's good you selected

427
00:55:43,846 --> 00:55:45,416
Yes But

428
00:55:53,033 --> 00:55:57,924
We've decided on the cast.
We'll rehearse for two hours each on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

429
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:01,737
There's still a month to go, so please do your best.

430
00:56:02,432 --> 00:56:04,276
If you have any comments, please let me know.

431
00:56:05,127 --> 00:56:05,799
Teacher

432
00:56:06,026 --> 00:56:06,697
Please let me know.

433
00:56:07,916 --> 00:56:14,362
When it comes to our school's anniversary arts and crafts festival, we have a tradition that is so prestigious that even other schools have a reputation for it.

434
00:56:14,776 --> 00:56:18,994
I'm sure there will be many senior guests in attendance.

435
00:56:19,065 --> 00:56:23,276
That's exactly what I told you.

436
00:56:24,369 --> 00:56:25,026
So?

437
00:56:25,737 --> 00:56:27,479
Well

438
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:32,541
I'm not happy with the casting.

439
00:56:33,502 --> 00:56:37,182
But this was decided by your vote.

440
00:56:37,776 --> 00:56:40,416
I know but

441
00:56:42,494 --> 00:56:46,447
I can't act...

442
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,518
You can't?

443
00:56:50,690 --> 00:56:55,744
You're the only one in our class who can do Jeanne d'Arc.

444
00:56:56,229 --> 00:56:58,104
We all agree on that.

445
00:56:58,533 --> 00:57:04,822
Since she declined, there's no need to force a recommendation.

446
00:57:06,392 --> 00:57:09,392
I thought you wanted to do it yourself.

447
00:57:10,517 --> 00:57:15,923
You're mean.
I just think the role requires the purity of a beautiful virgin.

448
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:20,579
Then I don't have a problem with it.
That's why everyone recommended her

449
00:57:20,923 --> 00:57:23,423
Ok. have a seat

450
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:29,439
I know you have some opinions. It was decided by your votes.

451
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:34,306
And I also think this is the best casting, so I'm going to go with it.

452
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:39,847
Please give them this

453
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:01,717
Makita?

454
00:58:02,397 --> 00:58:03,030
Madam?

455
00:58:05,217 --> 00:58:06,178
Come in

456
00:58:10,964 --> 00:58:12,238
Graduation Thesis?

457
00:58:12,832 --> 00:58:14,542
You need to get some rest. You're going to be exhausted.

458
00:58:15,613 --> 00:58:17,082
Are you off today?

459
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,386
I'm not

460
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:25,719
I'm here to consult with you

461
00:58:27,375 --> 00:58:28,078
What's going on?

462
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:33,875
Akiko seems to be getting further and further away from me.

463
00:58:34,765 --> 00:58:37,078
I'm very worried

464
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:45,504
I think maybe it's a UEDA thing.

465
00:58:47,895 --> 00:58:55,059
If she doesn't like us. I think it's okay if I decline his propose

466
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,214
After all, she's at an impressionable age.

467
00:59:01,652 --> 00:59:03,667
But I don't think it's just about Ueda-san.

468
00:59:05,269 --> 00:59:07,386
She doesn't even talk to me.

469
00:59:08,323 --> 00:59:13,847
Please, somehow, listen to Akiko's feelings.

470
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:30,252
Yasutome

471
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:33,236
I thought you won't attend PE lesson

472
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:37,674
You know, you and I always had our periods together.

473
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,822
You're done?

474
00:59:49,718 --> 00:59:51,531
She's getting weirder

475
01:00:34,367 --> 01:00:40,078
Mary, I am an unspoiled maiden.

476
01:00:53,284 --> 01:00:57,534
I disguise myself as a pure maiden

477
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,899
I have a heart stained with lewdness and wickedness

478
01:01:41,045 --> 01:01:46,607
I am a sinful, dirty woman.

479
01:02:26,799 --> 01:02:31,721
My soul is with you, Mary.

480
01:02:37,223 --> 01:02:43,208
Mary's image is clasped to my breast

481
01:02:44,044 --> 01:02:47,411
By me,Mary

482
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,403
I am the maiden who knows no dirt.

483
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:59,186
Well done.
There's only a week left, so we have to work a little harder.

484
01:03:00,217 --> 01:03:04,936
Let's surprise the principals on the day of the show.

485
01:03:13,857 --> 01:03:16,216
Listen

486
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:19,341
I wanna tell you

487
01:03:19,615 --> 01:03:25,341
I think our upcoming play will be the last beautiful memory of our youth!

488
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:27,412
That's right

489
01:03:27,732 --> 01:03:33,052
I think that those who participate in this play I think we should be proud of the purity of our uniforms.

490
01:03:33,302 --> 01:03:35,138
That's right

491
01:03:36,138 --> 01:03:40,630
She's talking about us as if we're not pure.

492
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:46,052
There are rumors that there is such a person, that's why I'm asking you for advice.

493
01:03:46,810 --> 01:03:47,771
Who?

494
01:03:48,201 --> 01:03:50,209
You have some kind of proof?

495
01:03:51,076 --> 01:03:59,170
But I'm not at liberty to say.
If you can think of anyone who might have something to say, on our honor. I think you should tell us voluntarily.

496
01:04:18,767 --> 01:04:19,626
Kumakura-san.

497
01:04:21,446 --> 01:04:21,970
What?

498
01:04:22,657 --> 01:04:24,368
we believed in each other!

499
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:27,751
I think it's terrible to say such a thing based on an irresponsible rumor.

500
01:04:28,915 --> 01:04:30,790
I think so

501
01:04:30,985 --> 01:04:32,274
She says it's a hoax.

502
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:34,626
I feel sorry

503
01:04:35,782 --> 01:04:42,540
What if someone doesn't deserve to be in a play that is pure and innocent?

504
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,423
Just tell us what the rumors are.

505
01:04:46,681 --> 01:04:50,962
Masako saw her checking out a book on pregnancy at the library.

506
01:04:51,751 --> 01:04:53,477
not only one time

507
01:04:56,335 --> 01:05:00,562
It's terrible to doubt someone over something as trivial as that.
Besides, anyone would read a book like that.

508
01:05:00,867 --> 01:05:02,742
I've read it

509
01:05:03,882 --> 01:05:05,656
Some people do more research.

510
01:05:05,681 --> 01:05:07,499
I read matrimonial magazines too.

511
01:05:20,386 --> 01:05:22,738
But there are more rumors about her

512
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:25,230
What kind of rumors?

513
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:29,457
Tell them

514
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,925
You can tell them

515
01:05:34,902 --> 01:05:39,761
The owner of the local grocer's said her tits are weird.

516
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:49,680
Is such a terrible thing for us to say?

517
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,048
Because facts are facts.

518
01:05:51,532 --> 01:05:55,141
This is our sacred classroom. We're not having a wellness meeting.

519
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:01,427
Then I'll tell you plainly

520
01:06:04,536 --> 01:06:05,419
Yasutomi

521
01:06:11,135 --> 01:06:14,260
Do you have the courage to make a vow of purity in front of everyone?

522
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:18,674
If you're so brave and confident, you should prove it even if you're naked.

523
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:37,261
I think she came to that conclusion on her own.

524
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:38,690
Shimakura

525
01:06:40,917 --> 01:06:45,831
If someone said such a terrible thing to me, anyone would leave.
Getting naked in front of everyone is terrible!

526
01:06:46,815 --> 01:06:48,987
You're the ones who hurt the class pride.

527
01:06:49,948 --> 01:06:51,940
I know Akiko better than anyone.

528
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:55,222
Or do you think I'm less trustworthy than the landlady at the grocery store?

529
01:06:58,753 --> 01:07:01,518
I hate you guys

530
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:09,122
To be honest,I love her.

531
01:07:09,888 --> 01:07:14,247
But I'm not emotionally ready to do so until I know whether or not I can marry an inbred.

532
01:07:15,046 --> 01:07:19,163
I'm not saying that inbreeding in general is wrong.

533
01:07:19,382 --> 01:07:22,523
There are cases where both positive traits are dominant.

534
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:30,031
As a doctor, I'm sure you're right.
I'm not in favor of suppressing emotions either.

535
01:07:32,399 --> 01:07:34,266
Someone is visiting you

536
01:07:34,524 --> 01:07:34,969
Who?

537
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:37,188
She's a beautiful high school student.

538
01:07:37,813 --> 01:07:39,750
That girl, right. go to see her

539
01:07:46,553 --> 01:07:48,006
Oh Natsuko

540
01:07:48,787 --> 01:07:49,397
Thank you very much.

541
01:07:50,686 --> 01:07:51,631
What's wrong?

542
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:53,975
Well...

543
01:07:58,875 --> 01:07:59,930
It's about Akiko-san.

544
01:08:02,204 --> 01:08:03,602
Something unusual?

545
01:08:05,235 --> 01:08:07,430
Akiko was bullied a lot at school today.

546
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:09,954
It's just not normal.

547
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:20,628
I don't want to believe that she's pregnant.

548
01:08:21,113 --> 01:08:24,918
But Akiko doesn't say anything about it.

549
01:08:27,183 --> 01:08:29,769
But that's terrible,

550
01:08:31,972 --> 01:08:33,644
She's not such a girl

551
01:08:33,972 --> 01:08:36,207
I believe in her too

552
01:08:38,352 --> 01:08:39,953
But

553
01:08:42,688 --> 01:08:44,219
You wanted to ask me?

554
01:08:45,344 --> 01:08:47,773
No no

555
01:08:50,063 --> 01:08:53,266
To be clear, I like her

556
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:57,352
But I believe a relationship between a man and a woman should be based on marriage.

557
01:08:57,938 --> 01:08:59,563
Some people laugh at me for being old-fashioned.

558
01:09:00,188 --> 01:09:03,234
I'm sorry, I doubt her

559
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:05,438
Do you wanna eat sweets?

560
01:09:06,102 --> 01:09:07,719
Hold on

561
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:18,541
I'm home

562
01:11:28,106 --> 01:11:29,004
Aki?

563
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:44,696
Aki?

564
01:11:54,175 --> 01:11:54,659
Aki?

565
01:12:01,835 --> 01:12:02,319
Aki?

566
01:16:34,145 --> 01:16:35,715
Why didn't you leave me alone?

567
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:37,153
You're stupid

568
01:16:52,436 --> 01:16:56,498
I'm a doctor.
People who take life for granted are my enemies.

569
01:17:08,076 --> 01:17:11,248
If you were alive, you'd have the pleasure of crying.

570
01:17:13,209 --> 01:17:17,662
Sorry, I'm bad girl

571
01:17:19,852 --> 01:17:21,571
My body is like this

572
01:17:21,596 --> 01:17:23,063
Forget it

573
01:17:25,259 --> 01:17:27,157
I'm a doctor.

574
01:17:33,790 --> 01:17:43,838
For the sake of your friendship with NATSUKO and to restore your own hope, you will be a great heroine of the school play.

575
01:17:46,432 --> 01:17:50,479
I won't tell your mother until then.

576
01:17:58,174 --> 01:18:05,393
I don't know how much you suffered while you were wandering between life and death.

577
01:18:08,401 --> 01:18:10,690
Do you know why you suffered?

578
01:18:11,909 --> 01:18:12,956
I'm sorry.

579
01:18:20,369 --> 01:18:21,720
Good night.

580
01:19:09,408 --> 01:19:13,900
You are Jeanne d'Arc, nineteen years old.

581
01:19:14,502 --> 01:19:16,924
Is that right?

582
01:19:18,135 --> 01:19:24,971
Do you swear fidelity in the name of Jesus Christ?

583
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:40,192
Tell me why you have assumed the form of a man and why you have come to the battlefield.

584
01:19:43,177 --> 01:19:46,497
Because I heard the voice of God in the forest.

585
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:53,865
Well, go to your genre, the bird of Orléans.

586
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:57,428
ONMI is the Son of God who will save France.

587
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:02,826
All God's voices are heard only by those in ministry

588
01:20:03,537 --> 01:20:05,217
Don't tell lies

589
01:20:06,334 --> 01:20:12,748
In fact, you are probably a demon who indulges in the lewd pleasures of foolhardy soldiers.

590
01:20:13,115 --> 01:20:14,701
I am not

591
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:20,990
Wrath of God.

592
01:20:25,188 --> 01:20:26,430
Mary

593
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:34,954
You are demon

594
01:20:35,336 --> 01:20:37,594
You are demon

595
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:50,859
High Priestess, please forgive Jeanne

596
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:53,890
Jeanne was never a witch.

597
01:20:54,336 --> 01:20:56,304
Only God is the judge

598
01:20:56,656 --> 01:20:59,398
Jeanne was never a witch.

599
01:21:01,101 --> 01:21:03,367
please forgive Jeanne

600
01:21:03,759 --> 01:21:10,571
Witch of Orléans, who bears the innocent maidens

601
01:21:11,517 --> 01:21:13,540
Know thy God now.

602
01:21:14,587 --> 01:21:16,556
Set fire on

603
01:21:23,656 --> 01:21:27,055
You are demon

604
01:21:31,545 --> 01:21:38,146
Mary, I send my soul to the high skies with fervent prayers.

605
01:21:39,628 --> 01:21:44,136
Mary, I am a pure maiden.

606
01:21:46,464 --> 01:21:50,863
That tone is the sound of a flock of angels

607
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:58,183
I feel the image of Mary in my heart

608
01:21:58,910 --> 01:22:02,324
Please hold my hands

609
01:22:03,089 --> 01:22:10,253
Mary, I am a pure maiden.

610
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:22,700
Take her

611
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:31,342
What should we do?

612
01:22:31,553 --> 01:22:32,514
I'll go

613
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:38,336
She was a miscarriage after all.

614
01:22:38,594 --> 01:22:39,969
Just as we thought.

615
01:22:40,165 --> 01:22:42,290
She's ruined her reputation at school.

616
01:22:42,315 --> 01:22:43,266
Who's the man she's with?

617
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,313
I don't know. You should ask Natsuko.

618
01:22:46,934 --> 01:22:49,442
I think he's a college student from her hometown.

619
01:22:50,965 --> 01:22:53,379
I wanna see him

620
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:03,076
What's the matter?

621
01:23:03,101 --> 01:23:04,030
Leave me alone!

622
01:23:04,592 --> 01:23:07,928
She betrayed me.
She cheated on me.

623
01:23:07,953 --> 01:23:11,553
I understand.
But Akiko has to go to hospital now.

624
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,592
I'd like you to go with me.

625
01:23:13,717 --> 01:23:18,561
She's so dirty lair

626
01:23:19,455 --> 01:23:22,056
Say hi to Dr.Nakata

627
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:25,072
Please

628
01:23:35,774 --> 01:23:36,516
What's the matter?

629
01:23:37,930 --> 01:23:44,031
She's a patient you brought in yourself.

630
01:23:45,462 --> 01:23:49,392
She's my future wife, the one I was telling you about.

631
01:23:52,870 --> 01:23:54,143
So it's you then?

632
01:23:54,589 --> 01:23:55,409
No, no.

633
01:23:57,386 --> 01:24:00,011
No, it's just different, and it caused me a lot of pain.

634
01:24:01,378 --> 01:24:07,885
I'd been thinking about it for a long time, and then I finally decided to marry her, and that was the day I found out...
she was pregnant.

635
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,705
Well, I didn't know that

636
01:24:16,392 --> 01:24:19,486
Learning about life is even harder than learning to be a doctor.

637
01:24:23,471 --> 01:24:25,877
I'll take care of the patient.

638
01:24:27,362 --> 01:24:28,432
Thank you

639
01:24:50,942 --> 01:24:52,387
Miki

640
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,145
you deceived me too.

641
01:25:02,376 --> 01:25:04,329
You're the one who did this to Akiko.

642
01:25:05,134 --> 01:25:06,994
What did you say here the other day?

643
01:25:07,744 --> 01:25:08,712
What I said wasn't a lie.

644
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,165
I believed Akiko.

645
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:15,001
That's why I...

646
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:17,251
Suffer on your own. You deserve it.

647
01:25:18,361 --> 01:25:22,533
What about me, who was betrayed by both you and Akiko?

648
01:25:29,978 --> 01:25:32,986
It wasn't me who got Akiko-san pregnant.

649
01:25:35,228 --> 01:25:38,462
It was an accidental mistake.

650
01:25:40,893 --> 01:25:46,307
Akiko tried to clean up her mistake by dying.

651
01:25:47,338 --> 01:25:51,401
And now she started practicing the role of Jeanne d'Arc as hard as she could.

652
01:25:52,666 --> 01:25:55,909
She tried to regain her lost innocence.

653
01:25:57,261 --> 01:26:00,433
Seeing that, I couldn't help hating Aki-chan.

654
01:26:02,722 --> 01:26:06,268
I made up my mind that I could have a child of my own.

655
01:26:08,673 --> 01:26:09,220
Blood pressure?

656
01:26:09,470 --> 01:26:10,291
95

657
01:26:13,822 --> 01:26:16,775
Sorry Natsuko

658
01:26:20,529 --> 01:26:23,490
It was my fault

659
01:26:23,888 --> 01:26:24,787
Sorry Natsuko

660
01:26:25,584 --> 01:26:26,365
Akiko.

661
01:26:26,654 --> 01:26:27,638
It's okay.

662
01:26:29,021 --> 01:26:30,130
Sorry Natsuko

663
01:26:30,795 --> 01:26:31,654
It's okay.

664
01:26:34,670 --> 01:26:35,701
Akiko.

665
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,045
Akiko.

666
01:26:51,952 --> 01:26:52,945
Kazuko

667
01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:56,937
Natsuko-san, please forgive Akiko-san.

668
01:26:58,124 --> 01:27:00,866
She keeps calling out to you now.

669
01:27:02,202 --> 01:27:09,108
She doesn't say a word about the pain of the operation, she's gritting her teeth and enduring it.

670
01:27:11,171 --> 01:27:13,741
She keeps calling out to you now.

671
01:27:14,851 --> 01:27:18,171
Sorry,Kazuko

672
01:27:27,484 --> 01:27:32,687
Natsuko.
We young people are still imperfect and prone to mistakes.

673
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:36,601
That's why we must cherish our purity even more.

674
01:27:38,808 --> 01:27:42,808
Aki-chan is risking her life to regain her purity.

675
01:28:21,967 --> 01:28:24,264
Teacher!

676
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:32,430
Akiko

677
01:29:37,032 --> 01:29:39,329
I've been waiting for you.

678
01:29:39,508 --> 01:29:43,274
Natsuko..I...

679
01:29:43,633 --> 01:29:45,321
Let's go

680
01:29:48,321 --> 01:29:49,696
Sorry,Natsuko

681
01:29:51,649 --> 01:29:53,485
I wasn't going to come.

682
01:29:54,672 --> 01:29:56,281
I don't deserve it.

683
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:01,453
I couldn't stay while I was thinking about you.

684
01:30:03,949 --> 01:30:04,769
Natsuko.

685
01:30:10,505 --> 01:30:13,888
Don't worry,Let's go

686
01:30:14,622 --> 01:30:17,075
Here's fine

687
01:30:18,270 --> 01:30:20,825
I'm listening here

688
01:30:21,466 --> 01:30:25,614
That's fine with me.
Please go

689
01:30:28,092 --> 01:30:28,967
Akiko

690
01:30:34,415 --> 01:30:37,735
They're all waiting for you.
Look at that.

691
01:30:41,844 --> 01:30:47,711
Come here,Akiko!

692
01:30:49,477 --> 01:30:50,899
She's here

693
01:31:24,252 --> 01:31:25,018
Akiko

694
01:31:26,862 --> 01:31:28,666
I was sorry

695
01:31:29,463 --> 01:31:30,955
I was sorry too

696
01:34:00,442 --> 01:34:10,949
THE END

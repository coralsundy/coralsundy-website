<i>Teppo inu / Gun Dog (1965)
(Inu/Dog Series #5)</i>

3
00:01:18,523 --> 00:01:22,430
Decide which one you will go with.

4
00:01:22,679 --> 00:01:25,679
Hey come on!

5
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,225
Decide which one you will go with.

6
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:32,250
I lost all my money. I can't go back to Osaka.

7
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:35,406
Are you also from Osaka?

8
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:36,938
What's wrong?

9
00:01:37,617 --> 00:01:39,180
I miss them.

10
00:01:39,734 --> 00:01:40,586
Take this.

11
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:43,266
I don't borrow money at gambling places.

12
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,266
Kodama bro

13
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,109
The president is calling you

14
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:48,672
Thank you for your work.

15
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:51,156
Take this.

16
00:01:51,484 --> 00:01:52,828
Leave me alone.

17
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,383
I'll do something about it

18
00:01:56,258 --> 00:01:59,375
But I have no money...

19
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:18,921
Wait!

20
00:02:24,023 --> 00:02:24,820
Dude!

21
00:02:41,063 --> 00:02:42,922
Get it together!

22
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:45,680
You're the man I was talking to earlier.

23
00:02:48,124 --> 00:02:49,812
Get it together!

24
00:02:50,046 --> 00:02:51,232
Your arms are slipping

25
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:52,991
and your legs are getting scratched,

26
00:02:53,813 --> 00:02:55,086
If I hadn't come, you wouldn't have moved.

27
00:02:55,889 --> 00:02:56,677
I'm sorry

28
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,429
If I had just held a pistol, I wouldn't have lost to them

29
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,835
Why were they targeting you?

30
00:03:03,966 --> 00:03:06,966
Please don't ask, okay?

31
00:03:08,164 --> 00:03:08,836
Bro

32
00:03:12,304 --> 00:03:14,609
Could you deliver this to Osaka for me?

33
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,039
300,000yen with the airplane...

34
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:21,375
I don't want to be the one carrying the money

35
00:03:21,523 --> 00:03:22,289
Don't get me wrong.

36
00:03:24,352 --> 00:03:26,342
My mother is sick and I want to send this to her.

37
00:03:35,047 --> 00:03:38,492
It's better for you to show your filial piety yourself.

38
00:03:44,575 --> 00:03:49,359
It can't be helped.
Ok, I'll take it

39
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:51,042
It's all right

40
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:52,078
Good evening

41
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:57,531
Are you really going back tomorrow?

42
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,891
Yes,I'll miss you.

43
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,695
I feel lonely without you, brother

44
00:04:02,937 --> 00:04:05,343
Hey come on.
Listen

45
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,126
I'm finally taking you to Osaka

46
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:08,968
Really?

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,570
I'm really happy

48
00:04:11,914 --> 00:04:13,203
If only you could enter here

49
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:14,297
Hey

50
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,953
It's a pistol!

51
00:04:26,648 --> 00:04:28,805
Don’t do that.

52
00:04:43,062 --> 00:04:45,088
Finally, I am in Osaka,

53
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:55,586
Welcome.

54
00:05:12,957 --> 00:05:16,398
Hey old man, come here for a second

55
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,025
Are you going to order something?

56
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,836
Old man,there was something like this
in the pork soup.

57
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,306
This is Petrao's pork

58
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,876
You hit the jackpot!

59
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,182
Isn't this a red dog?

60
00:05:26,546 --> 00:05:27,905
Just kidding, right?

61
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,289
That's not a dog

62
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:30,593
That's a cat, a cat.

63
00:05:30,688 --> 00:05:31,383
Cat?

64
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,906
Do you think You can drink without money?

65
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,570
This person has really messed up!

66
00:06:12,343 --> 00:06:15,676
If you're human,
then this guy is also human, not a monkey

67
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:19,898
You shouldn't be bossy

68
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,976
Are you a police?

69
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:25,695
Is that bad?

70
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:41,445
Kamoi, did you forget that I have eyes on my back?

71
00:06:45,387 --> 00:06:46,633
It's been a while since you returned from Kyushu

72
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,953
Well, just a moment ago.
How did you know?

73
00:06:49,007 --> 00:06:49,909
What did you come back here to do?

74
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,172
It's none of your business.

75
00:06:52,033 --> 00:06:54,719
If you don't say that, you're homeless and we will protect you.

76
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:58,679
You're annyoing.
You're like a tax collector.

77
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,316
You should stop gambling.

78
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,950
If I don't do this, I can't eat.

79
00:07:02,858 --> 00:07:06,241
If there is evidence,we can be arrested for gambling even if you are not caught in the act.

80
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,735
You understand, right?

81
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,546
There are many such people

82
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,820
You shouldn't be bossy.

83
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,346
It's like those who buy betting
tickets for horse racing or bicycle racing

84
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,468
Everyone here is a culprit in this, right?

85
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:20,968
Moreover, It's run by the government

86
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,914
Don't get in the way of my work.

87
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:27,692
Please crack down on them first

88
00:07:28,945 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm just a small part of the prize money here

89
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:33,796
What do you think?

90
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,898
See you later.

91
00:07:39,305 --> 00:07:41,852
Oh where is it?

92
00:07:43,028 --> 00:07:45,617
Where's my river's Boston bag?

93
00:07:46,535 --> 00:07:47,718
Don't you know?

94
00:07:49,648 --> 00:07:52,396
I left my bag here

95
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,976
A bag? I don't know about any bag

96
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,886
You blackmail me?

97
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:56,566
you know anything?

98
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:57,320
No.

99
00:08:01,483 --> 00:08:03,030
What are you doing?

100
00:08:04,797 --> 00:08:06,405
Oh my god.

101
00:08:16,367 --> 00:08:18,445
I'm here.

102
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:23,508
What are you going to do with me?

103
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:25,094
Oh it's a pistol

104
00:08:25,492 --> 00:08:27,086
I'll take it

105
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:27,898
You are stupid.

106
00:08:27,923 --> 00:08:30,289
Please pay me the fee.

107
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:31,820
I don't want to do that for free

108
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:35,117
Are you really thinking of going against our gang?

109
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:39,507
Bro

110
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:43,242
brother! Wait for me!

111
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,188
Give it back.

112
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:49,093
You're so annoying!

113
00:09:14,172 --> 00:09:15,773
Oh you.
What's wrong?

114
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:17,078
Nothing.

115
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:20,547
It's none of your business.

116
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,038
See you later.

117
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,891
Hey, wait a minute

118
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,496
What?

119
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,570
I guess I'll have to get your body check

120
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,187
Ok come on

121
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
If anything comes out, I'll treat you to a meal.

122
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,016
See, that's not it

123
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,476
You're really something, aren't you?

124
00:09:51,422 --> 00:09:53,023
Well...

125
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:55,531
Here?

126
00:10:09,867 --> 00:10:10,719
Oh here.

127
00:10:12,117 --> 00:10:14,500
I'm glad I left this alone

128
00:10:16,663 --> 00:10:18,867
Is this the Kodama family's house, right?

129
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:19,680
Yes

130
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,536
Are you his sister?

131
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,516
I'm glad to hear that

132
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,828
I brought this from your brother in Kyushu

133
00:10:24,891 --> 00:10:25,516
Really?

134
00:10:25,703 --> 00:10:26,305
Yes.

135
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,188
Who?

136
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,890
He's my brother's friend

137
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,536
I am Kamoi,

138
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,437
Nice to meet you

139
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:36,830
Well, please come in

140
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,000
Is he fine?

141
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,930
He's fine in Kyushu

142
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:46,531
Oh, is that so?

143
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,546
Is Kazuo in Kishu?

144
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:50,222
Not Kishu

145
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:55,093
Um, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,

146
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,781
Kyushu

147
00:10:57,234 --> 00:10:59,594
He's in Kyukanbetsu?

148
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,707
You don't understand....

149
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,880
I heard that my brother is in Kyushu

150
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Oh, what is he doing there?

151
00:11:09,366 --> 00:11:11,208
He's a site supervisor

152
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:15,328
Like this

153
00:11:17,422 --> 00:11:19,492
He's a site supervisor

154
00:11:19,547 --> 00:11:21,156
Oh, is that so?

155
00:11:21,422 --> 00:11:24,422
Are you his subordinate?

156
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,310
Yeah,I'm in his care.

157
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,687
Well, I should leave...

158
00:11:33,141 --> 00:11:38,007
Um, I'm looking for something.

159
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,180
Excuse me.

160
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:41,675
You

161
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,195
What did you do?

162
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:44,061
Take a look at your feet

163
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,437
I have received money from him

164
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,664
Money

165
00:11:56,844 --> 00:11:57,875
Money?

166
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:02,062
Did he give money with you?

167
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:02,914
Yeah

168
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,305
I see

169
00:12:07,913 --> 00:12:10,921
He knows I have nerve pain that limits my mobility.

170
00:12:13,945 --> 00:12:15,672
Make a tea for him.

171
00:12:16,382 --> 00:12:17,556
 please, don't mind me,

172
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,676
that's quite alright

173
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,000
Ok I get it

174
00:12:20,487 --> 00:12:22,225
You can hear well now

175
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:25,416
Excuse me.

176
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,546
Wait.
I still haven't heard Kazuo's story,

177
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,632
Have a seat

178
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:31,886
I'm off

179
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,836
It's noisy if I'm late

180
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,546
Be careful going

181
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,876
So, where do you work?

182
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,806
She works at a car dealership

183
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,210
She is on the night shift today.

184
00:12:43,235 --> 00:12:44,609
I get it.

185
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,906
Take care.

186
00:12:49,218 --> 00:12:53,226
Wait.
I still haven't heard Kazuo's story,

187
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,296
Hey!

188
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,101
He ran away

189
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,320
Thank you for waiting for me

190
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:16,046
I wonder if my brother is doing well

191
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,625
Ah, he's doing well

192
00:13:23,221 --> 00:13:24,734
You should have gone earlier, you know

193
00:13:30,086 --> 00:13:30,852
Go.

194
00:13:39,139 --> 00:13:40,898
Why did you want to meet
Kodama's sister?

195
00:13:41,106 --> 00:13:42,322
Didn't you get in touch?

196
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:45,882
Don't you know 16 group?

197
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,086
16 group?

198
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,376
That's a name like a pawn shop

199
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,546
If you didn't know that, are you going to take a fine or hit me?

200
00:13:50,742 --> 00:13:52,937
You talk too much, you brat

201
00:13:53,272 --> 00:13:55,265
Why did you go to Kodama's apartment?

202
00:13:55,764 --> 00:13:57,863
I just went to see his mother's illness

203
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:58,820
That's a lie

204
00:13:58,845 --> 00:13:59,875
If you know it's a lie, don't ask

205
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,000
What did you say?

206
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:18,656
You're just messing around

207
00:14:18,845 --> 00:14:20,523
This kid!

208
00:14:25,092 --> 00:14:26,358
Remember and notice!

209
00:14:32,653 --> 00:14:33,984
You're in the way!

210
00:14:38,117 --> 00:14:39,273
Is boss here?

211
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,006
What's wrong?

212
00:14:43,664 --> 00:14:45,617
A stranger is messing around

213
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:46,946
What's his name?

214
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,906
I don't know

215
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,101
I think he was asked by Kodama.

216
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,421
Take your eyes off that guy,

217
00:14:55,514 --> 00:14:58,514
you might just become the target

218
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:04,234
Make sure to watch closely. if you don't, you won't do anything at all

219
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,648
Hey brother, are you
looking for something

220
00:15:09,281 --> 00:15:10,117
Yes

221
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,551
That must be a pistol.

222
00:15:12,792 --> 00:15:13,648
Don’t shout so loud,

223
00:15:14,212 --> 00:15:14,941
Do you understand?

224
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:16,328
Yes

225
00:15:16,531 --> 00:15:17,625
That's good.

226
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:18,539
Hey brother,

227
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:19,789
don't bet another 100 yen

228
00:15:20,118 --> 00:15:22,444
I have no choice but to pay it.

229
00:15:23,409 --> 00:15:24,025
Where is it?

230
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,106
it's to the east

231
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,646
East? It's over there

232
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:28,426
Where around there?

233
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:32,523
Well, if it's close, from Janjan Yokocho in Shinsekai

234
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Nagoya, Tokyo, Hawaii, America,

235
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,281
Hey come on

236
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:39,601
Is that the pistol?

237
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,676
It might actually hit something

238
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,546
I can't tell anyone,

239
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,856
what should we do?

240
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:46,906
I have to make that

241
00:15:47,539 --> 00:15:49,106
where's the guy with the pistol?

242
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,968
Oh police!

243
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:53,227
I am not.

244
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,756
I'm looking for that pistol

245
00:15:56,515 --> 00:15:59,984
What the hell, are you
buying the pistol I made?

246
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,676
Are you stupid?

247
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,539
How can I pay for a water gun
with a sword?

248
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:09,703
What I'm looking for is, if I may
say, an important cultural asset!

249
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,570
It's on a different level!

250
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:20,781
Ugh, it stinks, but I wonder
what that guy is doing right now...

251
00:16:24,197 --> 00:16:24,731
Come on

252
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,230
Shot! Three! Five!

253
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,503
It's so noisy

254
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:29,874
I'm not dealing with this here,

255
00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:31,862
what are you talking about?

256
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,775
Come on,

257
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:37,550
Which one?

258
00:16:38,358 --> 00:16:40,465
I'll bid this

259
00:16:43,047 --> 00:16:45,381
6 and 7

260
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,404
Damn it.

261
00:16:50,994 --> 00:16:52,254
Which one?

262
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,825
Hey, guy

263
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,770
No matter how small it is,

264
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:58,703
I won't forgive a fraud!

265
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,476
What you're doing is...

266
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,216
It's an old trick from long ago!

267
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,996
You're the one who's going to pull this scam!

268
00:17:04,664 --> 00:17:06,603
I am in the 16 group!

269
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,485
Don't you forget it!

270
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,870
Just stop it, just stop it!

271
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,676
You all are also to blame for this painful situation

272
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,605
What do you mean by that?

273
00:17:16,278 --> 00:17:18,335
We talked about it with a 10-yen coin

274
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,736
Now, try using a 100-yen coin

275
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,266
It's a one-way ticket
to the heaven

276
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,582
Let's do something more

277
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,672
there's no way I'm doing that again

278
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:30,255
What is this big brother doing?

279
00:17:30,346 --> 00:17:32,526
Are you reedy?

280
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:34,188
What are you doing?

281
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:36,083
Shut up!

282
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:42,289
He's controlling it!

283
00:17:42,314 --> 00:17:45,314
I just flicked the light switch a bit, hmm,

284
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,106
Welcome.

285
00:18:17,853 --> 00:18:20,103
Oh you are working here

286
00:18:24,121 --> 00:18:26,532
What kind of relationship does your brother and the 16th group?

287
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,406
My brother has nothing to do with that

288
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:30,832
Wait a minute

289
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:32,882
Why do you run away when you hear about the 16th group?

290
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:35,192
It has nothing to do with you

291
00:18:38,248 --> 00:18:40,552
You're the guy from the 16th group last night?

292
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,266
You have a private car

293
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,300
Isn't it amazing how the money from day labor turns into a car

294
00:18:46,487 --> 00:18:47,554
What?

295
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,155
What?

296
00:18:51,159 --> 00:18:52,315
What do you think?

297
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,825
How about making it bigger by playing Clasico?

298
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:55,758
What?

299
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:58,596
Wait

300
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,200
Here's not good to do that.
Get out from here

301
00:19:01,956 --> 00:19:04,761
It's a magnificent new car, a new car!

302
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:05,848
Oh Tei-chan

303
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,065
Oh you

304
00:19:08,406 --> 00:19:09,197
when did you come out?

305
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,016
I arrived last night

306
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:11,117
Did you arrive alone last night?

307
00:19:11,232 --> 00:19:14,934
No.
I was with the man you treated.

308
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:16,993
His name is Kodama

309
00:19:18,146 --> 00:19:18,746
My brother

310
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:20,707
Come here for a second

311
00:19:25,003 --> 00:19:27,326
Don't shout too loud!

312
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:30,389
This person is Kodama's younger sister

313
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,466
She's a beautiful woman

314
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,536
So, what about my brother?

315
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,796
At Hiroshima station, you know

316
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,096
He got me a oyster lunch box.

317
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,696
It was even more delicious than I expected

318
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,796
I didn't hear anything like that

319
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,820
Hey, where was he going?

320
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:44,870
Kodama is either in Tokyo or Nagoya,

321
00:19:44,895 --> 00:19:46,797
so don't interrupt the conversation! Just focus on your own thoughts

322
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:48,465
I wanna hit you.

323
00:19:49,685 --> 00:19:51,891
How did  brother get hurt?

324
00:19:53,395 --> 00:19:55,719
it's not serious, so don't worry about it

325
00:19:57,092 --> 00:19:59,189
Well, where did that guy disappear to?

326
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,980
Hey, what are you doing standing there,

327
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:08,620
Big brother!

328
00:20:10,424 --> 00:20:11,645
What's up?

329
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:12,966
Kodama is saying he's going home

330
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,607
What?

331
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:17,515
A woman who came from Hakata said she was with Kodama

332
00:20:17,969 --> 00:20:19,283
Who is Kodama?

333
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,270
What is that outfit?

334
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,506
I was racing

335
00:20:25,666 --> 00:20:26,813
You are stupid.

336
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,435
Kodama was originally an accomplice in
the bicycle racing operations of this group

337
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:36,636
He might mess up a little

338
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,731
We sent him to the Kyushu group, but he blackmailed 300,000 yen from the president

339
00:20:39,756 --> 00:20:40,453
I'll make up for it

340
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,116
I handed him over with the promise that he wouldn't return from Kyushu

341
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,140
We tried to clean up after that, but he escapes and will start moving behind us

342
00:20:47,292 --> 00:20:50,470
If cheating in Keirin is exposed, it will be a problem for us.

343
00:20:50,701 --> 00:20:52,694
The police must be investigating us.

344
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,633
He's good at shooting

345
00:20:56,651 --> 00:20:58,160
Isn't he aiming for the president?

346
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,674
I know that

347
00:21:00,373 --> 00:21:02,712
By the way A guy who is a friend of Kodama

348
00:21:03,383 --> 00:21:05,438
We have to use Kamoi Daisuke, a free shooter

349
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:05,925
Free?

350
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:11,339
He crashed Shishido, Daiko, Gamou

351
00:21:12,194 --> 00:21:13,134
He's skillful

352
00:21:13,245 --> 00:21:14,025
Which one we need to kill?

353
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,206
Blackmail Kamoi first

354
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:18,715
and ask where Kodama is

355
00:21:20,131 --> 00:21:21,949
Brother, are you really coming over?

356
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,099
I can come over, but what are you doing?

357
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,215
That Tsukamoto Shoko's BG

358
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,456
It's turned out pretty good, hasn't it?

359
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,646
You know Tsukamoto Shoko?

360
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:32,366
Yeah, that neighborhood

361
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,923
OK I'm coming over.

362
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:39,025
Come on over now

363
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,825
I can't go right now because
I'm looking for something

364
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,205
For what?

365
00:21:43,377 --> 00:21:47,037
Hey, that Boston bag was missing

366
00:21:47,062 --> 00:21:50,062
Well then, The pistol is in the bag?

367
00:21:51,969 --> 00:21:54,969
You should hurry up and get to work

368
00:21:54,994 --> 00:21:56,781
Are you coming over?

369
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:57,212
Yes

370
00:21:57,237 --> 00:21:58,085
Promise me

371
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,487
Promise me

372
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,033
See you

373
00:22:06,823 --> 00:22:09,203
Don't you have eyes in front?

374
00:22:11,566 --> 00:22:12,902
I was sleeping and walk

375
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,011
Don't wake me up

376
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:17,775
You're still as stubborn as ever

377
00:22:18,199 --> 00:22:20,333
There's something on your back

378
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,596
Is that a noodle?

379
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,716
You always eat udon, don't you?

380
00:22:24,753 --> 00:22:27,753
Udon is the easiest to digest for me.

381
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:36,041
16 group?

382
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,811
How do you know that?

383
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:42,248
Well...

384
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:46,082
16 group is

385
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,962
They manage cabaret, Turkish baths, and other tourism businesses under the name of Tsukamoto trading company

386
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:58,603
The reality is that it is the center of an organization involved in, violence, bribery, horse racing fraud, and bicycle racing  fraud

387
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:02,389
They have a lot of power throughout the Kansai region

388
00:23:05,573 --> 00:23:08,573
He is the one among the many victim

389
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,626
I know that Alcoholics

390
00:23:12,535 --> 00:23:13,782
He's Hayakawa

391
00:23:14,234 --> 00:23:16,621
He is a former racer

392
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,478
He had no money so he cooperated with 16 groups.

393
00:23:19,124 --> 00:23:22,124
Won't you arrest the mastermind?

394
00:23:22,386 --> 00:23:24,166
They are clever at doing evil things.

395
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:28,950
Just eating udon all the time won't let you escape easily

396
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:33,308
They keep their fraud a secret from the government.

397
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,010
They show the racers a fake list.

398
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,485
The racers feel comfortable cooperating with them.

399
00:23:41,469 --> 00:23:43,655
But this is the trap

400
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,816
when th incident was exposed

401
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,036
The racers has disappeared from that area

402
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,784
This is how it works

403
00:23:48,696 --> 00:23:53,396
There are also rumors that a guy used by them was sent to places like Kyushu

404
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,580
I guess that kind of sound will eventually be silenced

405
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,936
An accident of unknown cause

406
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,755
Moreover, it seems that there are two
or three cases of unexplained incidents

407
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,706
What are you going to do about that?

408
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,743
Oh it is your job.

409
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Well, you should raise your salary, you know

410
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,722
Ah, that was delicious. By the way,

411
00:24:19,922 --> 00:24:20,609
Wait

412
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:22,195
I won't treat you

413
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,392
Just pay your share, or you'll get arrested

414
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,319
You are still as exaggerated
as ever

415
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:28,553
It can't be helped.

416
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,463
Take care of this

417
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,336
Goodbye

418
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:35,191
Don't be ridiculous

419
00:24:36,105 --> 00:24:39,716
You're going to make the store lose money,

420
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:43,851
You really are
an overly inquisitive person

421
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,687
What are you planning to do after drinking the customer's leftover sake? If you want it, just say you want it

422
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:49,833
Say it if you want it;

423
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:50,720
I want

424
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,035
this is not okay

425
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,996
This is mine.

426
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,266
If you want it,

427
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,366
you should pay taxes on it

428
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:58,506
This is not acceptable. Why would you do something so dirty?

429
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,986
You know, everyone pays taxes like I do, right?

430
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:03,165
Don't say things like that,

431
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:04,269
You're so annoying

432
00:25:04,764 --> 00:25:06,254
Get him out

433
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:09,258
Forgive him

434
00:25:10,276 --> 00:25:13,276
Oh you, I'm sorry

435
00:25:13,697 --> 00:25:14,610
Thanks

436
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:20,149
You shouldn't act like a homeless person.

437
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,255
You were good bike racer

438
00:25:23,306 --> 00:25:28,360
I can't forget that man's face

439
00:25:28,609 --> 00:25:33,295
Police are investigating bicycle racing fraud

440
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:36,108
We've got a lead and we'll find it ourselves.

441
00:25:37,192 --> 00:25:41,440
I'll find him and catch him myself.

442
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,740
I'm worried about your body, Hayakawa

443
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:49,685
Thanks.

444
00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:53,389
You won't be able to find him in that condition.

445
00:25:54,183 --> 00:25:55,116
Sorry.

446
00:26:02,812 --> 00:26:05,812
Brother, visit me

447
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,552
Can I see your fortune?

448
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,476
should I let you see the person being questioned?

449
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:13,759
Please, please,

450
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:19,828
Have you been dumped by a woman?

451
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:22,548
I'm looking for a man.

452
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,545
This is quite funny

453
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:36,417
Are you going to come with us or Do you want to have surgery on your stomach?

454
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:39,631
My appendix is ​​more inside

455
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,573
Hey.

456
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,913
I should have my pistol

457
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:43,646
What are you going to do with us?

458
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,365
I would forget it! I’ll leave it to the doctor

459
00:26:46,390 --> 00:26:48,060
I'll pay it later.

460
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,730
If you tell someone about this, starting tomorrow, you won't do this business.

461
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:09,962
You are really tough.

462
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,796
What do you think? A guy with guts

463
00:27:13,827 --> 00:27:15,084
He has guts

464
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,770
He won't give up

465
00:27:19,673 --> 00:27:20,947
You can't take it anymore

466
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,427
That's because it's a living body, isn't it?

467
00:27:23,539 --> 00:27:24,565
Just one word

468
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,906
Tell us where you gonna meet with Kodama in Osaka

469
00:27:27,003 --> 00:27:28,913
We'll release you

470
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,007
I'm looking for something

471
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,635
If I find that, I will came to see you.

472
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:36,182
A woman?

473
00:27:36,207 --> 00:27:37,148
You are stupid.

474
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:43,407
That's a pistol I made.
The feel of it is great

475
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,387
Someone took it in Osaka

476
00:27:46,692 --> 00:27:48,165
Bro

477
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,962
What?

478
00:27:52,635 --> 00:27:53,822
It's true that he says.

479
00:27:53,847 --> 00:27:55,793
Kuroko takes that,

480
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:56,546
You have it?

481
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,886
I am hiding it
in the roof of my apartment

482
00:27:57,911 --> 00:27:59,926
You are stupid.
Why aren't you delivering it to boss?

483
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:00,901
Sorry.

484
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:04,802
I'm going to see our boss

485
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:06,940
Watch on him.

486
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:15,325
Damn it.

487
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:20,995
Oh shit.

488
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,379
Take 2 or 3

489
00:28:22,918 --> 00:28:25,765
 If the monk comes, what will happen?

490
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,006
The monk is here

491
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:27,847
You're so noisy, you pig! Huh?

492
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:30,061
You lose it

493
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:32,501
Try it again

494
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:33,694
Hey

495
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:35,777
Leave it to me.

496
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,943
What?

497
00:28:38,569 --> 00:28:40,863
Open your mouth.

498
00:28:43,577 --> 00:28:44,764
It hurts me.

499
00:28:46,185 --> 00:28:47,998
You're stupid brad

500
00:28:48,225 --> 00:28:49,465
It hurts me.

501
00:28:57,705 --> 00:29:00,705
From now on, You scream and I'll cut you

502
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,756
What's the hell?

503
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,554
So this is what Kamoi has?

504
00:29:15,589 --> 00:29:17,740
huh? you got something good

505
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,151
Mitsuko, let him drink.

506
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,099
Will you work?

507
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:31,578
First, kill Hayakawa who was racer

508
00:29:32,589 --> 00:29:35,215
He knows the fraud we do

509
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,396
That's all?

510
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,916
Of course, You have to kill Kodama too

511
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,606
By Kamoi's pistol

512
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,619
Kamoi becomes the culprit

513
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:44,182
that's how it is

514
00:29:49,032 --> 00:29:50,350
Release Kamoi

515
00:29:50,782 --> 00:29:52,062
Make him free

516
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,785
It's obvious that he'll get in touch with Kodama somewhere

517
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,373
Damn it.

518
00:30:00,149 --> 00:30:01,953
Ok I won

519
00:30:01,978 --> 00:30:02,846
Next

520
00:30:02,871 --> 00:30:03,873
Once more.

521
00:30:04,246 --> 00:30:05,421
I want my money back

522
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:09,265
The world of competition is tough, so come on,

523
00:30:15,245 --> 00:30:16,338
Damn it.

524
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,900
Once more.

525
00:30:19,966 --> 00:30:21,040
It can't be helped.

526
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,856
It's a shirt, a shirt

527
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:25,325
here we go!

528
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:26,995
This is your last chance, you know

529
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:27,955
I get it

530
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:30,641
Hurry up

531
00:30:35,384 --> 00:30:37,332
So which one should I choose?

532
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,840
Is it this one?

533
00:30:45,353 --> 00:30:46,716
You're staying calm

534
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:47,942
Are you drinking this?

535
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,395
It's a drink for woman

536
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,004
what?

537
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:51,137
It's for kids, isn't it?

538
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:52,746
Why not do it straight?

539
00:30:52,771 --> 00:30:53,472
Alright!

540
00:30:54,532 --> 00:30:56,510
I'm going to shove this one down your throat!

541
00:31:08,627 --> 00:31:09,647
You bastard!

542
00:31:15,396 --> 00:31:16,390
It hurts me.

543
00:31:41,527 --> 00:31:42,552
Don't move!

544
00:31:49,454 --> 00:31:51,426
Your eyes get better?

545
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,298
What?

546
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:53,965
Hold on.

547
00:31:54,711 --> 00:31:57,711
I'm glad it saved us time

548
00:31:57,825 --> 00:31:58,518
Kamoi

549
00:31:58,817 --> 00:32:00,264
Sorry to misunderstand you

550
00:32:00,468 --> 00:32:01,734
Forget it

551
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:07,947
I'm keeping your stolen pistol. Sorry

552
00:32:08,045 --> 00:32:09,172
Don't say sorry

553
00:32:11,844 --> 00:32:13,204
You did something nice.

554
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:16,612
Let me try it

555
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,773
He can't do anything with it

556
00:32:20,704 --> 00:32:21,291
Let me try it.

557
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:22,639
Give it to him

558
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:23,906
What?

559
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:25,059
Give it to him

560
00:32:25,227 --> 00:32:26,367
It's bad

561
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:27,583
It's okay.

562
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:29,675
Are you sure?

563
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:30,799
Leave it to me

564
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:31,561
It can't be helped.

565
00:32:32,063 --> 00:32:33,381
Thank you very much.

566
00:32:41,064 --> 00:32:42,978
It was just practice

567
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,870
Look at this.

568
00:32:56,951 --> 00:32:57,897
Take it.

569
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:02,387
Once more

570
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,666
Open and fire.

571
00:33:13,876 --> 00:33:14,817
Open!

572
00:33:15,608 --> 00:33:16,428
Fire.

573
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:40,046
I want to challenge you with my pistol

574
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,036
Hey, sorry to intrude...

575
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:55,370
but, Tsuru-chan,

576
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:56,248
Cherry

577
00:33:56,273 --> 00:33:57,272
So, Cherry-han?

578
00:33:58,185 --> 00:34:01,256
I thought you were a Tsukamoto training company employee.

579
00:34:01,544 --> 00:34:03,506
You're working at sex industry

580
00:34:03,796 --> 00:34:04,858
Don't fool me.

581
00:34:04,966 --> 00:34:06,998
I shouldn't be joking about anything

582
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,194
This place is run by Tsukamoto Training Company.

583
00:34:09,897 --> 00:34:14,084
I work here so I'm a bath girl.

584
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,623
You hit me.

585
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,975
You were very hurt

586
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,467
Don't worry.

587
00:34:23,046 --> 00:34:25,966
Who attacked you?

588
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,811
At the Columbia university of America

589
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:29,726
I've never heard of it

590
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,904
I'm starting to say it too,

591
00:34:33,407 --> 00:34:35,323
but this is how it is, hey

592
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:38,069
You have a nice figure.

593
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:41,873
My hips and bust are internationally top-notch

594
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:43,873
Your height is pure Japanese style

595
00:34:43,898 --> 00:34:45,975
but I've got a good balance going on

596
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:49,724
Yeah, you've got a solid balance horizontally

597
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:52,780
and that mole on your butt

598
00:34:52,952 --> 00:34:53,835
This is fake.

599
00:34:54,475 --> 00:34:56,500
Brother, please remove my mole

600
00:34:56,751 --> 00:35:01,272
I really want to help you, but I' can't move.

601
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:03,458
You have no choice but to take it yourself

602
00:35:03,647 --> 00:35:04,632
How?

603
00:35:04,657 --> 00:35:07,225
I want you to rub it with the clay feet on that sheet

604
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,795
Hey, if you say something cool,

605
00:35:10,795 --> 00:35:12,037
I'm feeling hot.

606
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:13,303
Turn it off.

607
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,889
Oh no. I took it out.

608
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,584
What now! Huh? What should I do

609
00:35:19,609 --> 00:35:20,600
It's hot.

610
00:35:20,777 --> 00:35:22,233
It's hot!

611
00:35:22,258 --> 00:35:25,604
Can't you do something about this?

612
00:35:26,546 --> 00:35:27,382
Take it out

613
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,061
Hurry up
and take it off!

614
00:35:29,147 --> 00:35:30,881
Oh no. I took it out again.

615
00:35:31,647 --> 00:35:32,710
I don't know what to do

616
00:35:32,742 --> 00:35:33,709
It's hot!

617
00:35:34,356 --> 00:35:36,312
Get it together!

618
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:42,725
Teruko, phone call.

619
00:35:46,665 --> 00:35:47,787
This is Teruko on the phone

620
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:50,921
Bro.

621
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:53,459
where are you right now?

622
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,300
Don't get close to the apartment, okay?

623
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:03,875
I thought it was a call from your brother, wasn't it?

624
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,796
No, it was not

625
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,716
Then who was it from?

626
00:36:07,796 --> 00:36:10,585
Oh,was it from Daisuke Kamoi?

627
00:36:12,027 --> 00:36:17,147
You should be careful, that guy might end up being a problem later

628
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
He'll hand your brother over to the police.

629
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:22,585
He?

630
00:36:24,335 --> 00:36:25,272
Yeah.

631
00:36:43,311 --> 00:36:43,999
Ready?

632
00:37:07,092 --> 00:37:10,358
Do you want your shoes polished?

633
00:37:25,233 --> 00:37:26,116
Left.

634
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:28,983
That's enough.

635
00:37:32,225 --> 00:37:33,069
You

636
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:35,287
You

637
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,678
Wait.

638
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:44,217
Wait!

639
00:38:28,398 --> 00:38:31,398
It's dangerous for a woman to walk alone around here, you know?

640
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:40,936
Come on,

641
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:43,819
you should go home,I can't work

642
00:38:43,844 --> 00:38:46,022
My boss gets mad at me

643
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:50,085
What's the hell?
I can't stay here any longer.

644
00:39:23,663 --> 00:39:24,975
Leave from here.

645
00:39:32,394 --> 00:39:35,283
What's wrong? Hey, what's going on? What's wrong?

646
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:36,978
Get it together.

647
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:39,025
Are you alright?

648
00:39:40,213 --> 00:39:41,423
What's wrong?

649
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,994
I've seen you somewhere.

650
00:39:44,408 --> 00:39:45,813
You're the alcoholic man.

651
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:46,775
I saw

652
00:39:47,705 --> 00:39:48,299
I found it

653
00:39:48,324 --> 00:39:49,041
What did you see?

654
00:39:49,814 --> 00:39:51,330
Mikitai....

655
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:52,971
You don't have to talk much

656
00:39:52,996 --> 00:39:53,830
Mikitai....

657
00:39:53,855 --> 00:39:55,541
Bring him out

658
00:40:01,471 --> 00:40:05,260
I'm just a witness, don't keep me waiting

659
00:40:09,221 --> 00:40:10,033
How's him?

660
00:40:10,893 --> 00:40:13,893
A pistol bullet hit him in the heart.

661
00:40:13,918 --> 00:40:16,721
This medallion ended up in his pocket, so he was saved.

662
00:40:20,299 --> 00:40:22,650
This is a very good pistol.

663
00:40:23,353 --> 00:40:26,369
Without this he would have died

664
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,158
Kamoi

665
00:40:35,981 --> 00:40:38,087
Have you seen this?

666
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,204
I have no idea.

667
00:40:45,664 --> 00:40:47,744
but I can smell of you

668
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:56,337
I can smell alcohol,

669
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,846
I think you have a stuffy nose.

670
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,870
What happened to that handmade pistol?

671
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:06,488
I threw it away a long time ago

672
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:16,156
I think I'll need to give you a little physical examination

673
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:17,072
That's not good

674
00:41:29,447 --> 00:41:30,892
Won't you arrest me?

675
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:34,111
Chief?

676
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,072
The surgery went well

677
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:38,642
So, what about the witness statement?

678
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:39,666
I'll take care of it.

679
00:41:40,213 --> 00:41:44,632
Hayakawa found the man who lured him into a scam.

680
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,127
He was shot with a pistol while trying to capture him.

681
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,798
So, this is a strategy of a certain organization.

682
00:41:51,385 --> 00:41:52,416
A certain organization?

683
00:41:52,572 --> 00:41:53,408
Yeah

684
00:41:54,626 --> 00:41:59,001
This is the quickest way to find out where this pistol came from.

685
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:06,353
You know, should I also cooperate with the investigation?

686
00:42:07,193 --> 00:42:09,673
This is quite a different attitude from during the day

687
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:13,994
What made you change?

688
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:15,533
Kamoi

689
00:42:17,694 --> 00:42:21,355
Well then, I'll try to cooperate with you

690
00:42:21,892 --> 00:42:22,924
I think you feel very encouraged

691
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:29,517
There is no need to cooperate

692
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:33,306
This physical evidence is enough

693
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:37,220
An unexpected person may be the culprit

694
00:42:37,245 --> 00:42:40,111
That's part of the fun part of police work.

695
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:47,337
That is my pistol

696
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:48,666
A certain organization?

697
00:42:50,439 --> 00:42:51,603
He gave me a hint

698
00:43:14,966 --> 00:43:17,212
Kazuo hasn't called me about anything.

699
00:43:20,424 --> 00:43:22,150
What happened to him?

700
00:43:22,932 --> 00:43:24,197
He called my working place.

701
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:26,924
Really?

702
00:43:29,142 --> 00:43:30,205
Where is he now?

703
00:43:30,617 --> 00:43:33,290
He works on construction in Takayama.

704
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:34,978
He seems to be very busy.

705
00:43:35,103 --> 00:43:36,650
I see.

706
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:42,110
Why didn't you tell me about it sooner?

707
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,322
I need Sake

708
00:44:03,791 --> 00:44:05,790
You should drink beer.

709
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:08,728
I am a customer

710
00:44:15,462 --> 00:44:17,056
You shouldn't come to a place like this

711
00:44:19,369 --> 00:44:20,353
I'll be back soon.

712
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:22,541
Wait.

713
00:44:24,605 --> 00:44:25,954
Why did you come to Osaka?

714
00:44:26,051 --> 00:44:28,603
I'll kill Tsukamoto

715
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:30,814
I will compete with him

716
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:31,947
Will he accept the challenge?

717
00:44:31,979 --> 00:44:34,399
If not, I will expose the cheating in Keirin.

718
00:44:35,176 --> 00:44:38,876
I want to eliminate that group.

719
00:44:38,901 --> 00:44:41,541
You'd better fight with him.
You will be killed by them.

720
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:42,962
You will also be arrested

721
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,306
I hear you have ties to the police.

722
00:44:48,324 --> 00:44:50,090
Are you going to hand me over to the police?

723
00:44:50,770 --> 00:44:53,111
Am I ? Don't call me an idiot,

724
00:44:53,235 --> 00:44:54,564
Don't do unnecessarily

725
00:44:56,283 --> 00:45:00,188
I'll make sure to kill Tsukamoto

726
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:03,064
You are stupid.
You are very selfish.

727
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:05,566
What about your mother and sister?

728
00:45:07,642 --> 00:45:09,211
You shouldn't worry your parents.

729
00:45:10,897 --> 00:45:15,056
So, you think about that question and left it to me

730
00:45:15,252 --> 00:45:16,361
so just leave me alone

731
00:45:22,877 --> 00:45:23,611
Kodama

732
00:45:44,853 --> 00:45:46,994
Well, unfortunately, the
president is currently on a trip

733
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:50,212
I am Komae, the secretary section chief,

734
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,345
I see you are the secretary section chief

735
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,456
Let's put the past aside for now

736
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:00,509
16 Group has just been reborn
as Tsukamoto Commerce

737
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,033
and is running a completely honest business,

738
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,958
as you can see with our Turkish bath tourism project

739
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:09,426
By the way, where is the president traveling to?

740
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:10,826
It's the usual place, of course

741
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:13,418
It's sudden, but I always get in touch from the destination

742
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:14,867
I haven't received a call from him yet.

743
00:46:15,536 --> 00:46:17,615
If you still have any doubts at this point,

744
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,532
please feel free to bring the Search warrant

745
00:46:19,557 --> 00:46:21,465
or whatever you need to do

746
00:46:26,380 --> 00:46:30,623
I mean, you don't even think about a handgun, do you?

747
00:46:30,648 --> 00:46:32,968
please contact the police station
once the president returns

748
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,536
I apologize for the intrusion

749
00:46:42,597 --> 00:46:45,597
This is the result of you messing up with Hayakawa

750
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,663
Take Kodama out in one shot

751
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,823
For Kamoi, let it flow for now.

752
00:47:08,536 --> 00:47:10,267
Oh,16 group.

753
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:15,139
If the air is bad, the food tastes bad.

754
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:16,225
Get out

755
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:20,062
Where's Kodama?

756
00:47:20,479 --> 00:47:23,118
What are you talking about?

757
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:26,946
We have the evidence.

758
00:47:27,093 --> 00:47:29,984
If it's pepper, I have it

759
00:47:33,595 --> 00:47:34,541
You bastard!

760
00:47:34,671 --> 00:47:35,974
Hold on.

761
00:47:36,408 --> 00:47:39,229
You sometimes keep in touch with Kodama's sister.

762
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,796
Kodama's younger sister?

763
00:47:42,857 --> 00:47:44,628
She's saying so.

764
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,975
What is she saying? You let me walk free

765
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,692
You were waiting for me to contact Kodama.

766
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:55,190
This is our territory

767
00:47:55,452 --> 00:47:56,818
Hey Kamoi.

768
00:47:56,843 --> 00:47:59,530
you'll owe me a favor? Alright,

769
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:01,566
I don't really like selling favors, though

770
00:48:01,590 --> 00:48:02,946
But if it's about buying, I like that

771
00:48:29,217 --> 00:48:32,240
Don't you forget it!

772
00:48:43,101 --> 00:48:45,051
I tried going there once

773
00:48:46,398 --> 00:48:48,758
What about the inn, brother?

774
00:48:49,728 --> 00:48:52,728
Mom? She's definitely not in good condition.

775
00:48:54,214 --> 00:48:57,214
What? You have something to give me?

776
00:48:57,786 --> 00:48:58,671
Memo?

777
00:48:58,696 --> 00:49:00,971
He has come again

778
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:05,711
Were you on the phone with your brother?

779
00:49:06,015 --> 00:49:06,909
From where?

780
00:49:06,934 --> 00:49:07,621
No.

781
00:49:09,331 --> 00:49:12,187
Your brother trusted me and brought me the money.

782
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,871
I made it.

783
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:17,820
He trusted me.

784
00:49:18,064 --> 00:49:19,687
Please tell me where he is.

785
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:22,939
I can let your mother meet your brother.

786
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:27,822
I understand why your brother was expelled from Osaka.

787
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,746
If he continues like this he will become a big problem

788
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:33,736
This is for him

789
00:49:34,524 --> 00:49:36,446
You are also a member of Group 16

790
00:49:36,470 --> 00:49:37,556
What the heck is that?

791
00:49:37,915 --> 00:49:39,939
Am I saying a lie?

792
00:49:48,968 --> 00:49:51,345
That's a misunderstanding,

793
00:49:51,710 --> 00:49:52,686
It's a misunderstanding

794
00:49:52,749 --> 00:49:54,165
This is the second floor, isn't it?

795
00:49:54,244 --> 00:49:55,220
I'm not saying like that

796
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:57,759
She's misunderstanding

797
00:49:58,056 --> 00:49:58,970
who is she?

798
00:49:59,700 --> 00:50:00,907
It doesn't matter who

799
00:50:01,408 --> 00:50:02,649
It's frustrating, isn't it?

800
00:50:03,931 --> 00:50:05,525
Cut it out

801
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:08,860
If I do that, my back hurts a lot.

802
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,978
Hey bro.

803
00:50:11,439 --> 00:50:14,157
Can you hear my heartbeat?

804
00:50:15,367 --> 00:50:17,548
Yeah, I can hear it, it’s normal

805
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:19,962
How does it feel?

806
00:50:22,705 --> 00:50:25,423
Please say a kind word to me

807
00:50:25,868 --> 00:50:31,954
it feels like being crushed under a dump truck,

808
00:50:32,282 --> 00:50:32,958
I hate it, I hate it

809
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:33,995
Don't say something so off-base

810
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,605
Alright, alright, I got it then

811
00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:38,786
Shall I say something dramatic?

812
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,493
I'm happy

813
00:50:45,661 --> 00:50:46,474
Sorry

814
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,630
I'll have bad dream tonight.

815
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:13,294
Who?

816
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:15,278
Are you Kazuo Kodama?

817
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:20,420
I came here at 16 group’s request.

818
00:51:28,027 --> 00:51:29,840
 but I won't take even your life

819
00:51:30,661 --> 00:51:32,052
Don't worry.

820
00:51:37,013 --> 00:51:38,130
An-san

821
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:09,852
Wow, You're doing me a service too

822
00:52:09,942 --> 00:52:13,192
Until you come to love me

823
00:52:13,919 --> 00:52:15,606
How?

824
00:52:16,104 --> 00:52:19,301
Don't mess with me!

825
00:52:22,677 --> 00:52:23,884
Wow, Mama,

826
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:27,415
wow, you're so beautiful!
I'd like to get another massage

827
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,200
Come on.

828
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,016
There was a call for Kamoi-san

829
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:31,801
Huh? From whom?

830
00:52:31,826 --> 00:52:33,684
The person said "Kodama" who was waiting at the apartment

831
00:52:34,849 --> 00:52:35,419
Woman?

832
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:36,919
No, it was a man.

833
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,747
Let me get out.

834
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:40,630
Hurry up.

835
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,950
Brother!

836
00:52:49,558 --> 00:52:50,964
Brother!

837
00:52:56,114 --> 00:52:57,940
Please don't tell mother

838
00:53:14,886 --> 00:53:15,402
Hey.

839
00:53:15,753 --> 00:53:16,433
You're here.

840
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:19,827
Hey, it's Kodama?

841
00:53:20,902 --> 00:53:21,605
How about my mom?

842
00:53:22,663 --> 00:53:24,243
Don't worry, I haven't told your mother anything

843
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:28,106
If we find out about the defect in the surveillance device, will you come to the station?

844
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:30,667
I have various things I want to ask you

845
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,816
He came all the way here

846
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:34,966
because my brother wanted to see our mother

847
00:53:36,747 --> 00:53:39,120
Kamoi! You come too

848
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:42,261
Don't act like you're superior even though your salary is low

849
00:53:43,113 --> 00:53:47,230
My brother moved to Kyushu without permission

850
00:53:47,910 --> 00:53:49,675
She must be an acquaintance of the 16 group.

851
00:53:51,190 --> 00:53:52,020
So?

852
00:53:52,448 --> 00:53:54,556
My mother didn't notice,

853
00:53:54,580 --> 00:53:55,901
but I was aware

854
00:53:56,350 --> 00:54:00,503
I also noticed that he was associating with delinquent friends after leaving his job

855
00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:03,511
But even in such times, my brother was thoughtful of our mother,

856
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:09,972
buying various things with part of his salary and bringing them home to send to her

857
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,500
So you are worried about your brother's behavior

858
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,020
You've moved to the current apartment with our mother

859
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,115
He should have turned himself in.

860
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:25,620
Isn't it pointless to say things that can't be helped by the police?

861
00:54:40,332 --> 00:54:40,871
Kamoi.

862
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:44,652
That was fired from your pistol in the past

863
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,144
it's nostalgic

864
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:58,976
but no,

865
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:04,815
that's not it either.

866
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:13,433
This was the bullet that killed Kazuo Kodama

867
00:55:13,707 --> 00:55:15,849
Wow, that was a perfect match!

868
00:55:16,131 --> 00:55:16,975
Kamoi.

869
00:55:17,311 --> 00:55:18,280
It look nice!

870
00:55:18,305 --> 00:55:19,475
It's yours.

871
00:55:21,662 --> 00:55:24,084
You shot my brother....

872
00:55:24,411 --> 00:55:25,528
Please wait

873
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,936
I didn't.

874
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,318
Trust me.

875
00:55:29,343 --> 00:55:30,629
I understand

876
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:32,785
You were keeping an eye on my brother

877
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,529
You didn't want to let me meet my brother

878
00:55:34,554 --> 00:55:35,717
Please wait

879
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,946
What are you talking about? Do you think I would do something like that?

880
00:55:38,978 --> 00:55:41,978
I was thinking of introducing you to your brother,

881
00:55:42,003 --> 00:55:43,217
but that's a lie

882
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:44,456
It's a lie

883
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,746
It's a misunderstanding, and I don't know about that;

884
00:55:45,771 --> 00:55:46,677
I have no idea

885
00:55:46,702 --> 00:55:48,139
Here's the evidence

886
00:55:48,164 --> 00:55:48,912
I have no idea

887
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:50,599
Well, listen up

888
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,026
I returned to Osaka and delivered the 300,000 yen

889
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,050
I received from Kodama to you all

890
00:55:56,621 --> 00:55:59,567
No, no, before that at Daiyasuya, I met you

891
00:55:59,592 --> 00:56:03,177
My Boston bag containing a pistol was stolen at that store.

892
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:06,334
Moreover I helped him in Hakata.

893
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:11,162
I gave him a lot of advice.
It's so strange if I killed him.

894
00:56:12,529 --> 00:56:14,846
So why did you rush to the scene of Kodama's murder?

895
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:18,376
Well, that's strange, isn't it?

896
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:22,506
I see, this was launched to set a trap, huh?

897
00:56:24,787 --> 00:56:26,123
I feel sorry for you, though

898
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,365
I have an alibi, you know?

899
00:56:29,110 --> 00:56:31,296
It's an alibi that's almost too good

900
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,717
Back then, I was in a Turkish bath, right?

901
00:56:34,101 --> 00:56:37,271
I was stuck in the box, and I couldn't move my hands or feet,

902
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:40,390
but I managed to get my head out. Should I go?

903
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,131
1

904
00:56:43,592 --> 00:56:44,303
2

905
00:56:46,209 --> 00:56:47,061
3

906
00:56:47,437 --> 00:56:49,662
and then the next one is 4, right?

907
00:56:49,975 --> 00:56:52,131
Oh this is strange.

908
00:56:52,762 --> 00:56:54,123
but I wonder if the cherry has turned into a monkey.

909
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:55,561
That's strange

910
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:59,037
There were four middle numbers here,

911
00:57:01,904 --> 00:57:04,170
Madam.
It's lucky to me

912
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,994
Do you know Room 4, Madam?

913
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:10,767
We don't create rooms based on the numbers
4 and 9

914
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:12,431
What?

915
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:16,244
You received a call from Kodama.

916
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,564
It must be a mistake, right?

917
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,256
hey, there was a Cherry, right? Hey, sis,

918
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:23,131
there was that Cherry, right?

919
00:57:23,281 --> 00:57:25,397
There is no such person here

920
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:26,725
What a stupid.

921
00:57:29,482 --> 00:57:32,482
Tsuruchan, Tsuruchan, Tsuruchan

922
00:57:32,584 --> 00:57:34,357
Huh? There was someone
named Tsuruko, right?

923
00:57:34,382 --> 00:57:34,943
I don't know,

924
00:57:34,968 --> 00:57:35,576
but there was, right?

925
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,271
I don't know

926
00:57:36,296 --> 00:57:37,302
The name of the shop, Cherry

927
00:57:37,327 --> 00:57:37,975
I don't know

928
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:44,068
She's a cute woman with big breasts and a big butt. You know, don't you?

929
00:57:44,186 --> 00:57:45,022
I don't know

930
00:57:45,174 --> 00:57:45,615
You know, don't you?

931
00:57:45,655 --> 00:57:46,522
I don't know

932
00:57:46,694 --> 00:57:47,224
You know, don't you?

933
00:57:47,303 --> 00:57:48,037
I don't know

934
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:52,903
Kamoi, your alibi has collapsed, huh?

935
00:57:53,550 --> 00:57:55,302
That's true, She was really here

936
00:57:56,326 --> 00:57:57,146
You get it now?

937
00:57:57,881 --> 00:57:58,537
I see

938
00:58:01,506 --> 00:58:03,545
What are you going to do with me?

939
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:05,936
Hold on.

940
00:58:08,905 --> 00:58:10,569
Are you alright?

941
00:58:11,224 --> 00:58:12,638
Did it happen again?

942
00:58:23,014 --> 00:58:23,842
An-san

943
00:58:28,935 --> 00:58:30,763
Oh, it's you

944
00:58:31,294 --> 00:58:34,294
Thank you for all your help back then

945
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,006
I was looking for you

946
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,846
I wanted to express my gratitude

947
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,376
That's fine, but how's your body?

948
00:58:45,646 --> 00:58:47,276
I managed to sneak out of the hospital

949
00:58:47,873 --> 00:58:50,300
You need to sleep, right?

950
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:51,889
I can't just lie down

951
00:58:51,914 --> 00:58:53,427
I need to find that guy.

952
00:58:53,853 --> 00:58:58,677
Is that man Kazuo Kodama, the man who lured you into cheating at bicycle racing?

953
00:58:59,107 --> 00:59:00,818
Do you know him?

954
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:02,685
Where is he?

955
00:59:02,834 --> 00:59:04,068
I don't know that guy's name,

956
00:59:04,093 --> 00:59:05,899
but I remember his face

957
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,100
I caught him the other day and he got away.

958
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,685
He died.

959
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:17,443
He was killed.

960
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:27,818
This guy, this guy, this guy

961
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,780
Who killed him?

962
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,243
It's the same guy who shot you.

963
00:59:32,557 --> 00:59:34,560
There was a bad person behind Kodama

964
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:38,990
They were always keeping an eye on you and Kodama's actions.

965
00:59:42,435 --> 00:59:43,570
I'm so hungry

966
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,896
Just leave it to me

967
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:52,578
Welcome.

968
00:59:52,603 --> 00:59:53,871
He'll have Sake

969
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,213
just give me some oden

970
00:59:55,295 --> 00:59:56,162
I don't need Sake.

971
00:59:56,187 --> 00:59:56,778
Why?

972
00:59:57,063 --> 00:59:59,858
I promised Kimura detective that I would quit drinking.

973
01:00:00,389 --> 01:00:01,591
Will that police officer come here?

974
01:00:02,285 --> 01:00:03,515
Oh, I see,

975
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:05,190
you're not drinking?

976
01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:06,247
No

977
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:07,143
That's too bad,

978
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:11,631
What on earth did you come here for, anyway?

979
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:14,557
That police officers are very noisy.

980
01:00:14,919 --> 01:00:16,185
but that person is a good person, right?

981
01:00:16,210 --> 01:00:17,156
Whether he's a good person or a bad person,

982
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:19,136
he'll put handcuffs on me

983
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:20,074
Why?

984
01:00:20,314 --> 01:00:22,815
It's a long story if I start talking about it.

985
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:27,537
The pistol that shot you and Kodama was the same.

986
01:00:28,142 --> 01:00:31,142
That pistol is mine

987
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,570
Hey, An-san, did you sell me and Kodama out?

988
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:40,709
Look, there are things you can say and things you can't

989
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,068
The bag containing it was stolen

990
01:00:45,093 --> 01:00:45,744
Where?

991
01:00:45,927 --> 01:00:47,568
At the Daiyasuya in Shinsekai

992
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:50,036
You were about to take a 100 yen

993
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:51,865
That was when you yelled at Kimura

994
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,482
I saw it

995
01:00:54,849 --> 01:00:56,390
why didn't you say anything then?

996
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,654
I was daydreaming.

997
01:00:58,935 --> 01:01:00,811
What an idiot, who was that?

998
01:01:01,390 --> 01:01:03,310
He's a professional pickpocket.

999
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:05,694
Who?

1000
01:01:15,274 --> 01:01:17,021
What are you going to do with me?

1001
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:19,319
Give me the pistol you stole.

1002
01:01:19,498 --> 01:01:20,967
I have no idea.

1003
01:01:21,326 --> 01:01:22,100
I saw it

1004
01:01:22,272 --> 01:01:23,022
Where is it?

1005
01:01:23,748 --> 01:01:26,459
Matsudo from Group 16 took it.

1006
01:01:26,615 --> 01:01:27,451
Matsudo?

1007
01:01:27,717 --> 01:01:29,107
You don't need to lie to me

1008
01:01:29,132 --> 01:01:30,342
Trust me

1009
01:01:33,748 --> 01:01:36,209
I know him.
Leave it to me.

1010
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:48,225
I found out where he was.

1011
01:01:48,662 --> 01:01:49,397
Let's go

1012
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:50,397
Alright.

1013
01:02:01,858 --> 01:02:04,022
This way

1014
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,045
Kamoi

1015
01:02:12,434 --> 01:02:14,623
Give me back my pistol

1016
01:02:16,108 --> 01:02:17,342
I have no idea.

1017
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,138
If you don't know that either, that's fine.

1018
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,596
It seems the hot water is a bit lukewarm

1019
01:02:21,621 --> 01:02:22,217
Yeah

1020
01:02:22,242 --> 01:02:23,764
I will increase the temperature of the water

1021
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:26,059
Don't do anything reckless

1022
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:29,076
It's too hot!

1023
01:02:29,974 --> 01:02:31,166
Forgive me....

1024
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:33,568
If you say that, I forgive you.

1025
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,029
I gave it to my chairman

1026
01:02:35,054 --> 01:02:35,600
Where?

1027
01:02:36,576 --> 01:02:40,021
This is the chairman's house

1028
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:43,740
I want to ask you one more thing.
Where is Cherry, who used to work here?

1029
01:02:44,225 --> 01:02:46,319
She's in a drying facility.

1030
01:02:47,167 --> 01:02:49,193
Watch on him

1031
01:02:53,404 --> 01:02:56,084
Oh This pistol is very cool.

1032
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:57,717
Watch on him

1033
01:02:57,742 --> 01:02:59,584
Leave it ti me.

1034
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:24,033
Hey, Cherry!

1035
01:03:24,058 --> 01:03:25,128
Are you there?

1036
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:33,130
Help me out.

1037
01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:36,177
I'm coming now! Just wait a bit!

1038
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:41,673
You're so heavy!

1039
01:03:42,056 --> 01:03:42,752
Who's the hell you are?

1040
01:03:43,046 --> 01:03:45,316
this guy came to help me!

1041
01:03:45,564 --> 01:03:49,310
Eat your meal at my house

1042
01:03:50,307 --> 01:03:52,118
You’re not even losing your weight!

1043
01:03:52,305 --> 01:03:53,679
If you don't hurry up to get out ,you'll run into something scary! Look,

1044
01:03:54,056 --> 01:03:55,402
That's what I say

1045
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:59,598
Matsudo told me everything

1046
01:04:00,946 --> 01:04:04,439
Please take care of her.

1047
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:07,857
See you later.

1048
01:04:12,643 --> 01:04:13,907
Where did Teruko go?

1049
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:15,023
She just left a moment ago

1050
01:04:15,066 --> 01:04:15,539
Where to?

1051
01:04:15,709 --> 01:04:18,212
I don't know because she
left without saying anything

1052
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:20,343
Can you tell her?

1053
01:04:21,616 --> 01:04:23,182
I understand who killed your brother

1054
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:26,090
So please

1055
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:30,862
Is here Kodama Teruko residence?

1056
01:04:30,942 --> 01:04:32,149
She's out now

1057
01:04:32,396 --> 01:04:35,396
Can you hand this over her?

1058
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:37,776
(From Kazuo Kodama)

1059
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:41,495
I feel sorry about your brother

1060
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,631
It was that guy named
Kamoi who did it, right?

1061
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,984
Well, it's only a matter of
time before he gets arrested

1062
01:04:50,390 --> 01:04:53,390
By the way, you were present at the moment of my brother's death, weren't you?

1063
01:04:53,986 --> 01:04:56,263
At that time, did you receive anything from your brother?

1064
01:04:57,110 --> 01:04:57,477
No.

1065
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,870
Be honest.

1066
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:02,137
Well, your brother is dead,

1067
01:05:02,170 --> 01:05:03,246
so there's no need for you

1068
01:05:03,270 --> 01:05:05,416
This is something a bit important for me

1069
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:06,560
What are you talking about?

1070
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,106
I don't understand at all

1071
01:05:08,130 --> 01:05:10,584
Your brother must have the item he intended to trade with me

1072
01:05:10,899 --> 01:05:12,546
Haven't you received it?

1073
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:16,273
Do you have it?

1074
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:17,753
No.

1075
01:05:19,698 --> 01:05:20,778
I see.

1076
01:05:26,334 --> 01:05:27,767
Phone call from Sister

1077
01:05:28,543 --> 01:05:31,543
Don't let police know.I'll take care of Kamoi.

1078
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,596
Take that girl to my place

1079
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:41,492
Where are we going?

1080
01:06:13,565 --> 01:06:14,338
He's not here.

1081
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:17,281
Hold on.

1082
01:07:14,866 --> 01:07:16,437
He's gone...

1083
01:07:20,936 --> 01:07:22,171
Hey you! Raise your hands!

1084
01:07:41,995 --> 01:07:43,184
This is your pistol.

1085
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,180
Next up after Kodama
is you, Kamoi

1086
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:50,310
It's nice to die from your pistol

1087
01:07:57,038 --> 01:07:58,438
What's wrong?

1088
01:08:30,692 --> 01:08:31,705
Kamoi

1089
01:08:31,973 --> 01:08:33,126
Thanks.

1090
01:08:38,772 --> 01:08:40,119
This is working fine.

1091
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,868
You damaged my gun

1092
01:08:47,096 --> 01:08:48,036
Where's Tsukamoto?

1093
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,542
I've never played to kill anyone,

1094
01:08:53,270 --> 01:08:54,764
but when it comes to you, it's different

1095
01:08:55,317 --> 01:08:57,714
Where's Tsukamoto?

1096
01:08:58,698 --> 01:08:59,972
Suma's villa

1097
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:02,153
Suma's villa?

1098
01:09:13,532 --> 01:09:16,532
Those guys are at Suma

1099
01:09:17,050 --> 01:09:17,694
Shall we go?

1100
01:09:17,912 --> 01:09:20,046
I need to let Detective Kimura know about the crime!

1101
01:09:20,070 --> 01:09:22,236
No we don't need to do it.
He's useless.

1102
01:09:23,186 --> 01:09:24,684
I can do it by myself.

1103
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:28,858
Bro.

1104
01:09:43,972 --> 01:09:46,721
Give me what your brother gave you

1105
01:09:46,902 --> 01:09:48,079
I really don't know

1106
01:09:48,104 --> 01:09:50,450
I see, until you can tell me the truth

1107
01:09:50,475 --> 01:09:53,297
You're going to stay here for a while,

1108
01:09:53,564 --> 01:09:54,891
Boss!

1109
01:09:56,463 --> 01:09:57,850
Kamoi is here.

1110
01:10:27,174 --> 01:10:29,521
1 guy on right side.
2 guys on left side

1111
01:12:53,459 --> 01:12:55,390
Where did Okamoto go?

1112
01:12:55,779 --> 01:12:56,846
To the Wharf.

1113
01:14:51,513 --> 01:14:53,098
Help me!

1114
01:14:53,150 --> 01:14:54,791
Teruko!

1115
01:14:55,612 --> 01:14:58,700
Let me go! Let me go! No!

1116
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:03,492
Teruko!

1117
01:15:05,121 --> 01:15:06,101
Help me out!

1118
01:15:06,531 --> 01:15:07,225
I'll shoot you.

1119
01:15:13,274 --> 01:15:14,534
Watch out!

1120
01:15:51,573 --> 01:15:52,933
Kamoi-san!

1121
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,930
Let me go!

1122
01:16:03,497 --> 01:16:05,157
An-san!

1123
01:16:06,665 --> 01:16:08,345
That detective is here.

1124
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:18,575
I called him

1125
01:16:18,600 --> 01:16:20,103
Hey, don't be an idiot,

1126
01:16:21,314 --> 01:16:22,327
Tsukamoto is there.

1127
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:26,829
Don't get closer.
I'll kill her.

1128
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:28,970
Help me out!

1129
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:31,044
Get your hands off of me!

1130
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:32,829
Help me out!

1131
01:16:34,066 --> 01:16:37,905
Tsukamoto, let her go!

1132
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:41,100
Don't get closer.
I'll kill her.

1133
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:44,883
Get your hands off of me!

1134
01:16:45,752 --> 01:16:46,718
What is he going to do?

1135
01:16:46,905 --> 01:16:47,865
Get your hands off of me!

1136
01:16:48,784 --> 01:16:49,864
Help me out!

1137
01:16:52,788 --> 01:16:53,916
Kamoi!

1138
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:55,556
Kamoi!

1139
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:56,443
Give to to me

1140
01:16:59,593 --> 01:17:01,013
Kamoi!

1141
01:17:40,677 --> 01:17:44,607
What happened if I missed to shoot?

1142
01:17:46,450 --> 01:17:47,382
Did you shoot?

1143
01:17:47,449 --> 01:17:47,723
Yes

1144
01:17:47,863 --> 01:17:48,676
You?

1145
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:51,685
That Tsukamoto

1146
01:17:52,337 --> 01:17:54,770
He fell alone, no?

1147
01:17:58,432 --> 01:17:59,333
Give me the pistol.

1148
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,540
I just threw away into the sea earlier,

1149
01:18:03,969 --> 01:18:04,529
Really?

1150
01:18:07,008 --> 01:18:09,123
It's wasteful

1151
01:18:19,526 --> 01:18:21,088
We arrested all of them.

1152
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:21,823
Good job!

1153
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:22,438
Good job!

1154
01:18:26,138 --> 01:18:27,796
They only have scratches

1155
01:18:29,085 --> 01:18:31,582
No one has deep wounds

1156
01:18:31,673 --> 01:18:34,517
I want to see you face off against 007

1157
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,308
What, you don't know?

1158
01:18:37,425 --> 01:18:40,125
007 is one of my brother.

1159
01:18:47,344 --> 01:18:48,071
Mother.

1160
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,013
Mother.

1161
01:18:54,822 --> 01:18:58,002
Kazuo was a really man.

1162
01:18:58,785 --> 01:19:03,431
Look, he was doing such dangerous work, and he was dead in the line of duty, right?

1163
01:19:06,125 --> 01:19:07,566
That's right

1164
01:19:09,443 --> 01:19:10,056
That's right

1165
01:19:10,924 --> 01:19:11,527
That's right

1166
01:19:12,071 --> 01:19:14,290
He become like this

1167
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:15,411
Stay strong.

1168
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:19,075
If you cry, Brother Kazuo will cry too

1169
01:19:19,351 --> 01:19:21,066
So from now on,

1170
01:19:21,090 --> 01:19:24,090
I'm going to do this for Brother Kazuo

1171
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,395
Instead, I'll take care of you.

1172
01:19:36,256 --> 01:19:39,323
We have to work hard

1173
01:19:39,577 --> 01:19:40,850
Shall we head over there?

1174
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:41,944
Let's go, let's go,

1175
01:19:49,091 --> 01:19:50,328
Kamoi-san

1176
01:19:57,492 --> 01:19:59,604
Ah, I get it.

1177
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:01,565
What are you doing, idiot?

1178
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:02,477
OK OK.

1179
01:20:02,728 --> 01:20:04,612
I just came to prove it

1180
01:20:10,217 --> 01:20:14,125
Do you know why your brother did that job?

1181
01:20:16,273 --> 01:20:19,273
If you are the sister of a criminal with a criminal record

1182
01:20:20,040 --> 01:20:22,141
Your future life and marriage will be over

1183
01:20:23,540 --> 01:20:24,720
He thought like that.

1184
01:20:26,596 --> 01:20:30,984
That's right, Detective Kimura also thanks to your brother's notes

1185
01:20:32,714 --> 01:20:34,421
Then be happy.

1186
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:37,512
See you again.

1187
01:20:39,315 --> 01:20:40,275
Let's go.

1188
01:20:40,686 --> 01:20:41,787
Kamoi

1189
01:20:45,358 --> 01:20:47,551
He's such a good person.

1190
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,962
He doesn't want us to be sad.

1191
01:20:54,782 --> 01:20:56,982
He dressed like that

1192
01:20:59,378 --> 01:21:02,810
He pretend not to know

1193
01:21:04,936 --> 01:21:05,989
Teruko

1194
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:08,693
Your brother was died

1195
01:21:11,752 --> 01:21:12,800
Mom.

1196
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:23,564
Congratulations.
Shall I polish your shoes?

1197
01:21:24,096 --> 01:21:26,557
This is my first job this year
Shall I polish your shoes?

1198
01:21:31,769 --> 01:21:32,519
Hey old man

1199
01:21:33,348 --> 01:21:35,575
Please give it back to me

1200
01:21:36,252 --> 01:21:38,535
Hey,call me brother

1201
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:40,932
Thanks.

1202
01:21:40,957 --> 01:21:43,496
Come on, let's play a little

1203
01:21:44,317 --> 01:21:46,520
Sorry, but

1204
01:21:46,973 --> 01:21:49,458
I prefer more mature women.

1205
01:21:49,653 --> 01:21:51,302
You're pervert.

1206
01:21:57,465 --> 01:21:59,762
This year is the year of the horse

1207
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:02,903
I make a wish.

1208
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:06,170
Let's have a good year again this year,

1209
01:22:14,057 --> 01:22:17,057
This year is going to be fruitful, thank you

1210
01:22:21,430 --> 01:22:26,135
But the most celebratory thing is me

1211
01:22:30,116 --> 01:22:33,116
THE END

00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:21,300
<i>Judai no Yuwaku (1953)</i>

3
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:54,481
It's still a mess though

4
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:55,936
I will leave it to you.

5
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,936
Take care.

6
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,966
There will be a lot of executives here today.

7
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:00,386
You've said it many times

8
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,306
I clean my house,

9
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:03,679
and you clean the office.

10
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:09,515
Sorry for making you do the work for me.

11
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:11,929
You should go to the office early.

12
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:15,695
You must not cause trouble for your sister.

13
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:16,375
Got it.

14
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,031
Take care.

15
00:02:24,772 --> 00:02:27,772
Hey, hey, big sis!

16
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
What are you doing? Your buttons are still fastened

17
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:33,593
Hey, big sis!

18
00:02:33,618 --> 00:02:34,434
Where's my lunch box?

19
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,031
It's under the table.

20
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,843
There're just a few side dishes

21
00:02:40,805 --> 00:02:42,125
You shouldn't be extravagant

22
00:02:42,656 --> 00:02:43,773
I made it.

23
00:02:43,867 --> 00:02:46,867
She's becoming more and more professional

24
00:02:47,164 --> 00:02:49,218
She is just a part-time student

25
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,000
If you go to university, you will also have to work part-time.

26
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:56,335
I'd rather work at a soba restaurant than at a lottery shop.

27
00:02:56,867 --> 00:02:58,755
I can eat as much shumai and fried rice as I want.

28
00:02:58,842 --> 00:03:00,046
What are you talking about?

29
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,929
My sister has gotten really fat lately.

30
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:03,655
You idiot

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,396
It's currently in the phase of gaining weight

32
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:07,421
Come on, you two have to hurry up

33
00:03:07,461 --> 00:03:08,359
You're going to be late for school.

34
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,211
I'm going now.

35
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,976
What are you doing?
Hurry up and go

36
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,013
Can you bring me some shumai as a souvenir tonight?

37
00:03:21,093 --> 00:03:22,007
I want a manju.

38
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,616
I'll bring back lots of them

39
00:03:24,809 --> 00:03:26,815
Don't say anything arrogant

40
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,397
You just take home the leftovers

41
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:29,265
Hey!

42
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:29,264
Tsukimura-san

43
00:05:34,046 --> 00:05:34,983
oh sorry

44
00:05:37,699 --> 00:05:39,553
Good morning, good morning

45
00:05:39,578 --> 00:05:40,178
It's late.

46
00:05:40,203 --> 00:05:41,421
Wait a minute.

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,506
Mitsuko-san

48
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:53,069
Good morning

49
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:54,741
Good morning

50
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:56,356
I felt relieved

51
00:05:56,381 --> 00:05:57,936
Let's hurry up

52
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,016
You are weird person

53
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,536
If I come, you'll have to hurry up

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,746
Because there's no time left

55
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:02,736
It's okay

56
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,306
I've been up all night

57
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,350
I'm currently writing a 50 page novel

58
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:07,866
and I'm so sleepy

59
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,905
If you don't hurry, you'll be late

60
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,577
Ah, let's go

61
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,014
Ah, wait

62
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,264
Well, see you later

63
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:27,686
Hello, Aoki-san? It will be tonight at 6pm, right?

64
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,725
it it called "Rose-Colored Youth."

65
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,241
It will be the first piece

66
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:34,920
It's okay

67
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,217
I just need to draw about 10 more pictures

68
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,537
I'll draw it quickly today and finish it

69
00:06:55,147 --> 00:06:56,225
Good morning

70
00:06:56,258 --> 00:06:57,397
You're always late

71
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,436
Go quickly

72
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,842
You got scolded.

73
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,992
That teacher is always angry

74
00:07:09,102 --> 00:07:12,794
You're always late, so I'm going to tell your sister,

75
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:14,557
I don't want to, teacher, say that, no,

76
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:17,048
You have to enter from here.

77
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:18,375
Oh no

78
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:29,479
The origin of the word culture is the verb
to Cultivate, right?

79
00:07:30,549 --> 00:07:36,707
In other words, it is created by human will and power

80
00:07:36,982 --> 00:07:45,847
This has a lot of meaning in spiritual culture, whereas simulation has the meaning of material civilization.

81
00:07:48,957 --> 00:07:51,397
Ah, this reminds me

82
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,584
Look, the last one has begun.

83
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,346
My senior novelist....

84
00:08:06,643 --> 00:08:07,630
You're late.

85
00:08:08,377 --> 00:08:11,015
I was actually thinking of taking a day off today

86
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,040
I forced myself to come out because of the teacher's actions

87
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:19,550
You should tell that to a young teacher who just graduated from school.

88
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:37,045
Oh Setsuko.

89
00:08:39,346 --> 00:08:41,013
Sorry, I'm busy today.

90
00:08:42,872 --> 00:08:44,099
See you!

91
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:02,218
I'm sorry about that.

92
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:04,968
I was shocked

93
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:10,016
What happened?

94
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:16,658
He's blushing.

95
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,377
Did something happen with her?

96
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,283
Idiots ,We don't do anything

97
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:38,627
She... she...

98
00:09:49,497 --> 00:09:50,646
Are you studying?

99
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:51,938
uncle, be quiet for a second?

100
00:09:52,783 --> 00:09:55,302
Are you writing another novel?

101
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,186
Don't do that and study for school

102
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,246
You don't understand literature, uncle

103
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,316
Don't say something stupid

104
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,156
I'm your surrogate parent

105
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,656
Ain't I an adult now?

106
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,090
I don't need a parent substitute

107
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,365
What are you talking about?

108
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,750
A woman isn't a real woman until she's married, right?

109
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,116
Your sister's situation is fine, but

110
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,915
You're still five years away, or at worst,
ten years away

111
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,385
I'm having a hard time too

112
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:29,995
Is it delivery now?

113
00:10:30,052 --> 00:10:30,478
I'll go

114
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:31,296
That's fine

115
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,186
I'll go

116
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,936
I'm a little busy today

117
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,872
He's tired afterwards

118
00:10:34,004 --> 00:10:35,370
But I can't force you...

119
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:36,519
No worries.

120
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:38,130
Are you okay with that? Be careful,

121
00:11:07,343 --> 00:11:09,608
it's dangerous!

122
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:14,667
Be careful.

123
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,467
Tsukimura-san!

124
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:29,452
Tsukimura-san!

125
00:11:45,668 --> 00:11:48,104
Where's the manju, big sister?

126
00:11:48,907 --> 00:11:51,558
that's right, I forgot, sorry,

127
00:11:51,602 --> 00:11:53,624
I'm disappointed,

128
00:11:56,128 --> 00:11:56,914
it's you, Nobu-chan?

129
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,856
You  played a prank on you this morning!

130
00:11:59,858 --> 00:12:02,159
Don't do that anymore!

131
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:04,315
but you'll be selling soon

132
00:12:04,408 --> 00:12:06,075
What are you talking about?

133
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,803
What's wrong?

134
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,828
He played a prank this morning.

135
00:12:11,182 --> 00:12:12,802
I was embarrassed.

136
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:14,743
Don't do that to your sis.

137
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:15,978
Sorry.

138
00:12:25,566 --> 00:12:29,968
so sorry about the school trip money...

139
00:12:31,427 --> 00:12:32,993
Don't worry.

140
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,750
I had no intention of going from
the beginning

141
00:12:36,085 --> 00:12:38,505
But I feel sorry...

142
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:41,665
Let's make a coat for Nobu-chan

143
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,603
I feel sorry for him when it gets cold

144
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:44,825
Thanks.

145
00:12:44,876 --> 00:12:45,603
You are an idiot

146
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:47,640
Sorry

147
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,436
I've caused you so much trouble

148
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,907
it's nothing.

149
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,968
Come on, let's have dinner

150
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:37,456
What's wrong? Are you done?

151
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:38,896
Are you feeling unwell?

152
00:13:39,016 --> 00:13:42,450
Dad,we need to live in a world where poverty
is eliminated

153
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,250
What's wrong?

154
00:13:44,469 --> 00:13:49,160
You have never questioned the fact that you are rich, right?

155
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:52,066
Haruhiko-san, aren't you a little obsessed with that kind of thing?

156
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,416
That's not the case

157
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,526
I'm sure you think it's natural
that you can eat such a delicious meal

158
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,550
Hey hey, what's that?

159
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:05,060
Dad, there is a girl in our class who is studying
while working part-time as a maid at a soba restaurant

160
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,811
You like that student, no?

161
00:14:10,566 --> 00:14:11,259
Don't get me wrong.

162
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,118
I'm not like that.

163
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:19,565
Are you at the age where you're interested in girls?

164
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,994
Dad, you make fun of me like that

165
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:22,288
Don't get me wrong.

166
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,726
I am happy to see that
you have become so reliable

167
00:14:25,751 --> 00:14:29,060
Please don't make any stupid comments

168
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,640
Haruhiko has completely changed

169
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:34,914
Haruhiko is 18 now

170
00:14:35,506 --> 00:14:38,506
Some girls will be attracted by him

171
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:43,323
Your thought is not pure.

172
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:46,051
Haruhiko

173
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:48,992
it's fine, just leave him alone

174
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,254
Oh I see

175
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,930
It's bad to keep Kawahara waiting.

176
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,088
Setsuko

177
00:15:25,112 --> 00:15:27,100
Wait just a little longer

178
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,109
Just leave her alone.

179
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,235
Have a tea

180
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,012
Let's wait a little longer

181
00:15:39,215 --> 00:15:40,115
It's done!

182
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:43,989
Is it finished?

183
00:15:45,783 --> 00:15:46,472
it's a masterpiece

184
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:47,415
Shall I read it?

185
00:15:47,756 --> 00:15:49,342
Leave that for later

186
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,472
Well, that's fine

187
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,200
Setchan is also a candidate for the Akutagawa Prize this time around

188
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,655
Not so much though

189
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,250
But aren't female writers these days sloppy?

190
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,036
You're right

191
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:02,801
Keep going

192
00:16:02,908 --> 00:16:04,097
Please don't flatter her.

193
00:16:04,913 --> 00:16:06,819
She is easy to get carry away

194
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:09,196
It's like a balloon, blowing up at each other, right?

195
00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:13,856
it's rude to call it a balloon

196
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,646
Kawahara-san, I'm a writer in the future

197
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm scared

198
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,122
Ah, I'm sorry

199
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:25,799
Oh, it's already 7 o'clock

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,712
I have to go.

201
00:16:27,972 --> 00:16:29,445
Where are you going?

202
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,375
I have a group meeting tonight.

203
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Well, we feel bad for Kawahara-san for making him wait until now

204
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:37,831
But wouldn't it be better if I wasn't there?

205
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,323
You're such an idiot.

206
00:16:40,497 --> 00:16:45,250
Kawahara-san and my sister He's the kind of person who doesn't really care if it's his lover's hand or a broom.

207
00:16:45,275 --> 00:16:48,561
Sometimes, I want you to lead her so hard that it makes my sister's heart bleed backwards

208
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,032
Don't say like that.

209
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,566
Even if I just do this,

210
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,788
it's heavenly love, earthly love

211
00:16:55,954 --> 00:16:58,876
I'll go with the flow, eternal love at will.
I'm off.

212
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:03,390
I'm sorry I have time until the last train

213
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,500
I'm sorry she being selfish

214
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:12,199
No, it's fine to be innocent

215
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:19,219
But my hands are better that a broom.

216
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,720
Well, that's true

217
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:24,171
Come on.

218
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:31,503
Welcome.

219
00:17:31,639 --> 00:17:32,257
Yes, hello

220
00:17:32,294 --> 00:17:32,803
He's here?

221
00:17:32,828 --> 00:17:33,310
Yes.

222
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:36,761
Sorry I am late.

223
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:40,028
Give me a second.

224
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:45,207
I got chilling out when I came here

225
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,140
My school friends, the guys are studying hard for exams,

226
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,211
but the girls are so young

227
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,327
That's not worth talking about

228
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,056
How old are you?

229
00:17:57,081 --> 00:17:57,881
17.

230
00:18:00,322 --> 00:18:02,175
What are you so impressed with?

231
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,200
I thought you were about 13.

232
00:18:06,677 --> 00:18:07,697
Don't make fun of me.

233
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:13,090
I'm a little confident, please listen.

234
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,226
Are you going to yawn now?

235
00:18:17,482 --> 00:18:18,535
Everyone, start yawning

236
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,630
I'll read it then because I'll get distracted if I'm in the middle of it

237
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,616
The cosmos flowers have also fallen

238
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,617
Soon, when the chrysanthemums bloom in profusion,

239
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,287
how about a fading art? I absolutely loved it from the start

240
00:18:35,987 --> 00:18:38,987
Hmm, I see, I think so too

241
00:18:47,979 --> 00:18:49,266
Is she here?

242
00:18:50,248 --> 00:18:51,655
I wonder if there's anything interesting to talk about

243
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:52,889
Sorry no.

244
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,413
The snowflakes that began to fall soon disappeared into the pavement

245
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,241
Finally, the light from the window in Room 7 fades into darkness

246
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,576
Wow, this time it looks interesting

247
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,882
Please be quiet

248
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,036
Aoki-san!

249
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:13,228
It's great!

250
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:15,306
Go for it! It's a masterpiece

251
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,155
Wonderful.

252
00:19:16,265 --> 00:19:18,032
How nice it is!

253
00:19:18,669 --> 00:19:21,669
Well, what do you think, Murata-san?

254
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,176
I guess so

255
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,617
What do you think? Murata-san,

256
00:19:26,841 --> 00:19:27,801
well...

257
00:19:27,881 --> 00:19:29,528
I mean....

258
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,039
So It's like mix whiskey with soy sauce

259
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:36,767
What does that mean?

260
00:19:37,716 --> 00:19:38,396
Listen

261
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:42,096
Thinking about your experience and age

262
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,150
Do you really think you can write a love story between a middle-aged man and a widow?

263
00:19:45,886 --> 00:19:48,584
Because girls' novels are so weird

264
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:53,882
I'm talking about how you can mix
whiskey with soy sauce

265
00:19:54,436 --> 00:19:59,677
First of all, it's impossible to write a
novel without any experience in relationships.

266
00:19:59,878 --> 00:20:00,791
That's exactly it!

267
00:20:01,876 --> 00:20:03,519
Okay, I get it

268
00:20:17,158 --> 00:20:18,614
Teacher

269
00:20:19,401 --> 00:20:23,165
What's wrong with you?

270
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,185
Can I come up a little now?

271
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,813
Yes, please, please

272
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,129
Good evening.

273
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,776
That's rare

274
00:20:42,213 --> 00:20:43,944
You want me to read your novel again?

275
00:20:44,026 --> 00:20:44,679
No.

276
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,352
So what is it?

277
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:47,192
Teacher!

278
00:20:48,326 --> 00:20:49,212
Kiss me!

279
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,671
It's a kiss!

280
00:21:02,314 --> 00:21:04,231
You've really changed your mind again.

281
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,536
It's more brilliant than the fake robbery the other day

282
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,965
Because I can't write a novel without experiencing relationships

283
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,234
Idiot, I don't know who accused you of something bad, but basically,

284
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:22,344
It's important for humans not to
overstretch themselves on this bungee

285
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,240
If we follow your logic, then surely more and more great female writers should emerge from the local women and women of that class

286
00:21:29,643 --> 00:21:32,290
So am I a bad person?

287
00:21:33,743 --> 00:21:35,166
You are a good person.

288
00:21:36,881 --> 00:21:37,788
But little...

289
00:21:37,988 --> 00:21:38,908
What?

290
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:41,687
Sometime you act weird

291
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,984
But if it's a fake, then a bad is better than a good.

292
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:48,704
That's what they call the Chewing gum philosophy

293
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:51,600
Oh yeah.

294
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,528
Yes, you should read this book

295
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:56,467
Is this helping me?

296
00:21:57,109 --> 00:21:58,626
I don't know if this will be helpful or not

297
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,846
If you have any other books you'd like to read, feel free to bring them with you

298
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,522
Really?

299
00:22:10,424 --> 00:22:13,176
You took that much?

300
00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:14,578
You won't read all at once

301
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:15,451
It's okay.

302
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,906
Well, I'll just borrow these, see you.

303
00:22:31,606 --> 00:22:32,504
Sorry

304
00:23:07,706 --> 00:23:08,657
Sorry about yesterday

305
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,676
I was the one who was spacing out

306
00:23:11,729 --> 00:23:15,035
But you are amazing, I could never imitate you.

307
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:17,654
There's no need to imitate me

308
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:18,905
I was surprised

309
00:23:20,016 --> 00:23:22,659
From now on, I'll follow your example and become even stronger

310
00:23:25,807 --> 00:23:27,567
Sorry sorry

311
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,360
I've wanted to talk to you for a long time

312
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,413
Me too.

313
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:43,586
because when our eyes meet
you immediately turn away, right?

314
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:46,506
I thought you didn't like me at all

315
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:47,521
Me either.

316
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:51,326
I wish I'd told you that earlier

317
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,926
You can start now

318
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:56,845
We're going on a trip to Kansai soon,
right? I've been there and I know it well

319
00:23:57,418 --> 00:23:59,371
So I'll guide you.

320
00:24:03,674 --> 00:24:05,634
I'm sorry, sorry

321
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:35,711
Are you Mitsuko Tsukimura?

322
00:24:35,736 --> 00:24:36,044
Yes.

323
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:38,226
Professor Fujimoto is calling you

324
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:40,947
Yes.

325
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:46,985
Hello, Tsukimura-san, Setsuko-san's sister has something she'd like to tell you

326
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:49,128
It's about my sister...

327
00:24:49,601 --> 00:24:52,053
She's too much

328
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,330
I'm worried if she goes on the school trip

329
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:59,369
So I just recommended you to be Setsuko's contributor

330
00:25:00,126 --> 00:25:01,545
Unfortunately, I can't go

331
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,932
Because you're exaggerating like that

332
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:10,371
It would be fine if you just go out
with her when they are free to go out

333
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,686
If I left her alone, I don't know what she would do.

334
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:18,326
I'm not going on that
upcoming trip

335
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,238
Huh?

336
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:22,349
Excuse me.

337
00:25:26,033 --> 00:25:28,189
Professor Arikawa,come in

338
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:29,676
It's been a while.

339
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,191
Tsukimura-kun,let's take it.

340
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Tsuji-kun's sister has kindly offered the travel fee.

341
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:44,422
Of course, I'll keep this a secret from Setsuko,

342
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,203
so don't worry about anyone

343
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:58,276
Since the two teachers were so kind as to say so, you should grateful to take it.

344
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:12,175
I'm so glad. Now I feel good for Itsuko and it was worth it to have the teachers come

345
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,423
She is a really outrageous teacher.

346
00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:17,355
She only think of me as a bodyguard or secretary

347
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,926
She's like that.

348
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,463
Teacher, There is another person
who can't go on the trip.

349
00:26:26,009 --> 00:26:26,402
Who is it?

350
00:26:26,984 --> 00:26:28,266
The one in the hospital Hiroko-san

351
00:26:29,677 --> 00:26:33,706
I feel bad because it seems like I'm
the only one doing something good.

352
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,055
I'm going to visit her tomorrow

353
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,445
She's in the hospital in Kurihama?

354
00:26:39,422 --> 00:26:42,422
Okay, I'll go with you

355
00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:02,597
I'm so jealous. Everyone is healthy and on vacation

356
00:27:05,403 --> 00:27:08,915
I wonder when I'll get better?

357
00:27:09,443 --> 00:27:12,179
It's a young person's disease.
You'll be okay.

358
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:12,999
It will heal quickly.

359
00:27:15,506 --> 00:27:16,773
That reminds me.

360
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:19,798
You always go off the rails with the teacher, right?

361
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:22,318
No... that's not true

362
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,696
Actually, during the war
I was on the Okinawa front

363
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,906
You guys probably know that too

364
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:29,546
The Himeyuri Student Unit

365
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:33,348
With those girls I was wandering through a hail of bombs and shells

366
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:40,402
That was the first time I saw a first menstruationa girl

367
00:27:42,774 --> 00:27:43,900
menstruationa?

368
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,559
I don't want to hear that kind of story anymore.

369
00:27:51,373 --> 00:27:53,000
Listen to me.

370
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,630
I actually cried then

371
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:59,176
Oh, that person?

372
00:27:59,201 --> 00:28:01,471
No, it was me

373
00:28:01,802 --> 00:28:02,954
I was the one who cried.

374
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,419
Now I can laugh

375
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:21,463
I were really touched at that time

376
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,746
The power of an individual to grow despite the great violence of war

377
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,002
I felt this

378
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,952
The power of human growth is strong.

379
00:28:37,518 --> 00:28:41,813
Miyashita-kun, you are at an age
where you are growing rapidly,

380
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:44,604
You must have this power too

381
00:28:45,514 --> 00:28:48,514
Come on, cheer up and do your best

382
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:54,416
Teacher, I have confidence

383
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,728
That's right, that's true.

384
00:28:58,488 --> 00:29:00,961
Take care, Mitsuko

385
00:29:01,895 --> 00:29:03,502
I'll be waiting for you to come home

386
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,586
I'll buy you some souvenirs

387
00:29:06,214 --> 00:29:07,108
Please.

388
00:29:44,505 --> 00:29:46,405
This looks great

389
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,916
Everyone's tastes are surprisingly old-fashioned

390
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,726
I'm not interested in that kind of thing

391
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,865
Don't you want to eat?

392
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,690
Anyway,this is how it is

393
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,661
but it's true

394
00:30:00,229 --> 00:30:01,557
This looks delicious.

395
00:30:05,081 --> 00:30:06,730
Tsukimura-kun, there's space over there

396
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:10,333
Yes, I'm fine here

397
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:11,740
I see.

398
00:30:18,498 --> 00:30:21,498
Let's go out for a drink tonight, okay?

399
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:23,733
Hey,
you want to come too, right?

400
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:24,405
I can't.

401
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:25,357
Why?

402
00:30:25,382 --> 00:30:26,871
Taraki is so noisy

403
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:29,649
Hey come on

404
00:30:29,822 --> 00:30:30,871
Shall we go?

405
00:30:31,922 --> 00:30:32,798
which school do you guys go to?

406
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,235
Jonan High School in Tokyo

407
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,196
Is Jonan High School in Asakusa?

408
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,706
No, it's in Komaba

409
00:30:44,249 --> 00:30:45,136
Who the heck is he?

410
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,913
You guys are from Jonan High School in Tokyo?

411
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,079
Tokyo brings back memories.

412
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,696
Oh, you're in Tokyo too?

413
00:31:00,212 --> 00:31:01,838
Yes,
I studied at Keio for a while too

414
00:31:02,339 --> 00:31:04,490
My specialty is ancient Japanese art.

415
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,034
It's quite inconvenient in Tokyo

416
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,586
I changed to a university in Kyoto

417
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:11,610
Oh, so you know a lot about Kyoto?

418
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,226
That's true for most things

419
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,207
but a school trip is just an extension of school,

420
00:31:16,427 --> 00:31:17,940
so we can only see certain places

421
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,008
Then I'll guide you

422
00:31:21,195 --> 00:31:22,308
Please.

423
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,487
Definitely

424
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:28,850
I have to report my findings to the professor today,

425
00:31:31,733 --> 00:31:34,404
so how about we meet at Yasaka Shrine at 8 o'clock tonight?

426
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:35,430
That's fine.

427
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:37,725
Setsuko

428
00:31:38,038 --> 00:31:39,052
What?

429
00:31:41,338 --> 00:31:43,495
Kyoto at night is so romantic

430
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,888
Yes, it's wonderful.

431
00:31:57,382 --> 00:32:00,382
Everybody be quiet, everybody be quiet

432
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,124
Be quiet

433
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,825
and listen to me for a moment

434
00:32:05,068 --> 00:32:08,332
Well, you're free to go out now

435
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:12,459
However, please be sure to return by 10:00.

436
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,225
Anyone who is late will be severely punished

437
00:32:22,472 --> 00:32:23,952
Hold on.

438
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:24,869
Let's go.

439
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,099
It's only 3 hours, so let's go

440
00:32:29,486 --> 00:32:30,760
Hey, hurry up,

441
00:32:30,803 --> 00:32:31,576
Aren't you going?

442
00:32:32,175 --> 00:32:33,082
I'll go later.

443
00:32:33,107 --> 00:32:33,948
What about Risuko?

444
00:32:34,071 --> 00:32:34,804
I'll go later too.

445
00:32:35,693 --> 00:32:37,212
Let's go quickly

446
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,286
Wait a minute!

447
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:46,931
Let's go quickly!

448
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:47,233
Hurry up!

449
00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:49,735
Kyoto isn't uncommon!

450
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,476
Do whatever you want! Idiot!

451
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,233
Setsuko.

452
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:56,342
Are you sure to go?

453
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,752
I'll go! But isn't it a little early?

454
00:32:58,777 --> 00:33:00,179
Maybe it's better not to go.

455
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:00,863
It's okay!

456
00:33:00,888 --> 00:33:02,296
Then I'll go with you too!

457
00:33:02,386 --> 00:33:03,733
You're acting childish.

458
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:05,099
But

459
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,700
I've been thinking about a lot of things about tonight!

460
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,175
It seems like it's going to be really romantic,

461
00:33:10,942 --> 00:33:12,710
but three people would ruin it

462
00:33:12,916 --> 00:33:14,348
Tsukimura-san.

463
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,916
Ooi-san is there.

464
00:33:22,232 --> 00:33:23,226
You were waiting for me

465
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,247
Let's go

466
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,349
But Setsuko...

467
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,766
You promised me so much

468
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,787
Since the beginning of this trip, you've only been walking with Tsuji-kun.

469
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,239
I'm sorry, but...

470
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:36,805
Do you think you can't trust me that much?

471
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,323
No, that's not the case

472
00:33:39,152 --> 00:33:39,758
I get it.

473
00:33:40,158 --> 00:33:42,135
You've been making fun of me from the beginning

474
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:44,015
Oishi-san

475
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:00,678
Setsuko!

476
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:11,345
Grandma, one noodle.

477
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,362
Wait a minute.

478
00:34:18,594 --> 00:34:19,561
No.

479
00:34:19,747 --> 00:34:20,847
Wait a minute.

480
00:34:21,028 --> 00:34:22,015
We can't.

481
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:27,913
OOi-san.

482
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:32,183
I'm in trouble. Setsuko went to see a college student

483
00:34:32,499 --> 00:34:33,505
A college student?

484
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,206
You know, the person he was with on the train from Nara

485
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,230
Ah, he's face student.

486
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:46,624
What do you think?

487
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:48,275
I got drunk

488
00:34:50,265 --> 00:34:51,367
Is this your first time drinking alcohol?

489
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,918
No, I've been there many times, even to cabarets and bars

490
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:57,996
Oh, then let's go to Cabaret

491
00:34:58,913 --> 00:35:00,591
In my imagination?

492
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:06,006
Sometimes I can't tell if it's a dream, fantasy or reality

493
00:35:10,921 --> 00:35:13,686
Setsuko-san and Tsuji-kun

494
00:35:17,262 --> 00:35:18,967
Let's go there.

495
00:35:24,219 --> 00:35:25,092
How's that?

496
00:35:25,117 --> 00:35:28,256
Reality is better than dreams, right?

497
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,515
There.

498
00:35:37,722 --> 00:35:39,522
Aren't you cold?

499
00:35:42,232 --> 00:35:43,319
What are you doing?

500
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:44,510
Let go! No! Let me go!

501
00:35:44,957 --> 00:35:46,353
No! Let me go!

502
00:35:46,691 --> 00:35:48,428
No! Let me go!

503
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:51,163
Be quiet.

504
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:52,272
Get your hands off of me!

505
00:35:52,507 --> 00:35:54,038
Setsuko.

506
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,334
Ooi-san.

507
00:36:06,202 --> 00:36:07,421
What's wrong?

508
00:36:08,256 --> 00:36:10,936
why are you getting in our way?

509
00:36:11,379 --> 00:36:12,819
Let's go

510
00:36:15,069 --> 00:36:16,330
What's with that guy?

511
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,355
No, let's go home now

512
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,016
But what about Tsuji-kun?

513
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,856
it's okay, it's getting late

514
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:22,788
Let's go back early

515
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,077
Hurry up.

516
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,874
You're so noisy.

517
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:39,970
Oh, what's wrong?

518
00:36:44,999 --> 00:36:46,272
What's wrong?

519
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,007
Door is locked.

520
00:36:55,729 --> 00:36:56,983
Please open up

521
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,881
You're late

522
00:37:06,482 --> 00:37:07,378
Has anyone returned yet?

523
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,936
Everyone has returned

524
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:09,811
I'm glad.

525
00:37:09,836 --> 00:37:10,577
Come in.

526
00:37:11,141 --> 00:37:14,141
The teacher might get angry at you.

527
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Young people these days are like this.

528
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:22,811
They're really smart

529
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,811
Where have you been up until now? Huh?

530
00:37:32,944 --> 00:37:35,030
Where have you been up with Ooi until now?

531
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:48,012
Were you with Ooi-san?

532
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,233
Whatever it is, just leave it alone

533
00:37:54,051 --> 00:37:56,456
Hey come on.

534
00:37:56,729 --> 00:38:03,360
Jonan High School Haruhiko
Ooya is currently with a woman

535
00:38:13,936 --> 00:38:17,132
Don't tell anyone what happened tonight.

536
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:33,772
Please be quiet, please. Both players have arrived

537
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:38,256
If you can't name famous male-female pairings from all
over the world, past and present, within 5 seconds,

538
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,983
Well then, ladies first, see?

539
00:38:43,129 --> 00:38:46,129
Romeo and Juliet

540
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:48,585
Come on.

541
00:38:48,905 --> 00:38:50,998
Sicily

542
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:52,921
Onase.

543
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,593
Ukarukanpei

544
00:38:57,483 --> 00:38:59,311
Kanichi Omiya

545
00:39:03,624 --> 00:39:04,991
Takeoka Namiko

546
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,351
Next.

547
00:39:08,772 --> 00:39:10,218
Denge Ishihara

548
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:13,569
2 second

549
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,718
Harujiko Oyam Tsukimura Mitsuko

550
00:39:20,499 --> 00:39:22,147
That's right!

551
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:25,327
You shouldn't say such realistic things.

552
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:43,100
What's wrong?

553
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:53,084
A romantic love story forged in a Kyoto night

554
00:39:54,194 --> 00:39:56,210
It's like a novel Alto

555
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,866
What's that?

556
00:39:58,499 --> 00:39:59,804
Don't you know what Alto is?

557
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:05,889
It's a one-off love story about a young prince who falls in love with a beautiful girl while studying abroad

558
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,146
That's totally fine

559
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:11,170
Oh Kitty, I promise

560
00:40:14,882 --> 00:40:15,882
Don’t do that.

561
00:40:16,413 --> 00:40:17,444
Don't get mad.

562
00:40:19,561 --> 00:40:21,507
We are rooting for you

563
00:40:22,038 --> 00:40:23,186
You bastard!

564
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:26,265
Do you think they will get married?

565
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:29,288
We will support them.

566
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,694
Leave them alone

567
00:40:32,444 --> 00:40:34,483
Does the teacher know about them?

568
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:36,265
If the teacher found out, he would be angry.

569
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:41,452
Teachers have neither imagination nor aesthetic sense.

570
00:40:41,694 --> 00:40:44,718
Teachers are like scrubbing brushes

571
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:56,005
I've heard rumors about them too

572
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:57,967
Teacher, that's nonsense

573
00:40:58,693 --> 00:40:59,975
That's probably true

574
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:07,358
But it's only natural that suspicion would be raised about the two of us sneaking out in the middle of the night, and I want to know why too

575
00:41:13,631 --> 00:41:15,985
There must be some reason you can't tell me

576
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:23,311
You don't have to reply right away, but instead, can you be confident enough to not succumb to rumors?

577
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:29,092
Or have the courage to explain everything
to protect yourself?

578
00:41:30,111 --> 00:41:31,405
I hope it's one of those two.

579
00:41:37,116 --> 00:41:37,780
Got it?

580
00:41:39,835 --> 00:41:40,561
Well, go home

581
00:41:56,511 --> 00:41:59,511
You're treating your students a little too leniently.

582
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:02,991
I choose to trust my students

583
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,320
I see, that sounds good

584
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,800
I think sometimes that word means as an educator

585
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,233
Well, I've already contacted their current families before things get out of hand,

586
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:16,257
Please wait

587
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,406
Have you contacted them yet?

588
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:20,266
Your attitude is a bit confusing

589
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:23,290
But before we even knew the situation

590
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:26,116
I am in trouble

591
00:42:26,467 --> 00:42:29,584
Excuse me.

592
00:42:31,036 --> 00:42:34,178
Yes, please come in

593
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,736
Thank you very much for everything

594
00:42:36,768 --> 00:42:38,952
No, it's my pleasure.

595
00:42:39,554 --> 00:42:40,468
Has Setsuko come back?

596
00:42:40,608 --> 00:42:42,921
Setsuko hasn't come back yet

597
00:42:43,652 --> 00:42:46,225
Please come up and wait, okay?

598
00:42:46,718 --> 00:42:47,577
Excuse me.

599
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,256
Welcome.

600
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,216
I am her uncle

601
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,646
Setsuko always takes care of me

602
00:43:00,670 --> 00:43:02,405
Have a seat.

603
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,530
I was just talking about this now

604
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:10,452
It seems that Setsuko has been doing all sorts of things

605
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:17,444
If she makes a mistake and it becomes a newspaper article, then there will be problems with the marriage.

606
00:43:17,991 --> 00:43:20,006
so I was worried

607
00:43:20,690 --> 00:43:25,584
Mitsuko-san, I guess nothing really happened to that girl on her trip.
Is that true?

608
00:43:31,391 --> 00:43:33,702
She didn't listen to anything we said

609
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,140
I really hope you will continue to do more in the future

610
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:39,764
I also ask

611
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,886
Excuse me

612
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,280
Oh Mitsuko-san?

613
00:43:49,305 --> 00:43:50,511
Please keep staying.

614
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,053
Please keep staying.

615
00:43:53,078 --> 00:43:54,223
Excuse me

616
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:55,444
Mitsuko?

617
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:03,772
How was it?

618
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,670
 No, I can't do anything that would make Setsuko's family unhappy

619
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:15,319
Why is Tsuji's family unhappy? Hey,

620
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,466
tell me the truth

621
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:19,566
We've created a huge misunderstanding

622
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:23,205
But wouldn't that be blown away in an instant if the facts were clearly proven?

623
00:44:23,571 --> 00:44:24,845
Ooi-san, please forgive me

624
00:44:25,176 --> 00:44:28,176
There's something I just can't say right now

625
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:35,500
Well, she's precious children

626
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,840
I'm not saying who is at fault

627
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:44,500
Well, there's nothing we can do about what happened,

628
00:44:46,121 --> 00:44:49,121
but we need to be careful about what happens next

629
00:44:51,283 --> 00:44:52,755
My daughter doesn't do that.

630
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:57,541
So my Haruhiko was the one who seduced her?

631
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,361
that's not what I meant

632
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:04,190
Unfortunately, I couldn't make it to school today,

633
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:07,840
so this was the first time I heard your story

634
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:12,060
When she returns home,

635
00:45:12,169 --> 00:45:14,385
I will listen carefully

636
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:20,072
However, it ended up reaching the ears of the teachers

637
00:45:22,218 --> 00:45:25,218
Of course, I'm not saying that Haruhiko is not responsible,

638
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:28,127
I'm home.

639
00:45:32,244 --> 00:45:33,705
This young lady...?

640
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,744
Ah, I've already spoken to your mother about.

641
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:51,533
Let's make sure you don't have any further contact with our Haruhiko

642
00:45:54,591 --> 00:45:56,969
You're both still students

643
00:45:57,394 --> 00:46:00,394
Now you just need to study

644
00:46:02,254 --> 00:46:05,254
Well then, I'll excuse myself now

645
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:13,525
So please excuse me

646
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,791
I got a letter from the school

647
00:46:29,299 --> 00:46:32,299
That's a lie, we're nothing wrong

648
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,400
Everyone is just making up rumors

649
00:46:41,596 --> 00:46:42,603
Okay.

650
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:45,236
No matter what anyone says

651
00:46:47,034 --> 00:46:51,963
Mom knows you're not that stupid

652
00:46:54,090 --> 00:47:00,572
But the reason the rumors started
was because you were vulnerable

653
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,200
Since when have you been saying that?

654
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:09,776
Don't ask me anything

655
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,541
Believe me

656
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:17,455
Then I won't ask you anything

657
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,111
I believe in you.

658
00:47:22,487 --> 00:47:24,354
Don't cry anymore

659
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,370
Don't let things like this
discourage you and make you hate school

660
00:47:30,886 --> 00:47:34,392
If you have nothing to hide in your heart, then you should be honest about it

661
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,088
Right now, studying is the most important thing for you

662
00:48:09,124 --> 00:48:10,420
Stop it.

663
00:48:14,262 --> 00:48:19,360
you. We are being bothered by strange
rumors being spread about us because of you

664
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,476
If it's just a rumor, leave it alone

665
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,791
I'm actually celebrating your brave actions

666
00:48:26,979 --> 00:48:28,010
Don’t do that.

667
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:31,285
Right now, I'm writing this about my travels

668
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:34,630
Of course, I model myself  and you guys

669
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:35,166
Idiot

670
00:48:35,622 --> 00:48:38,924
I'll listen to your experiences
someday.

671
00:49:08,072 --> 00:49:08,799
I’m sorry.

672
00:49:09,182 --> 00:49:15,448
I heard my mom went to your place yesterday. Sorry

673
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,002
No, it's nothing

674
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,725
Look!
Those two, you said something stupid

675
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,150
Everyone teases them.

676
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:48,865
Because at that time...

677
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:50,175
poor thing

678
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:53,906
Please help them both atone for our sins

679
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:55,404
What should I do?

680
00:50:00,088 --> 00:50:02,025
Oh, hey! Please! Thank you!

681
00:50:03,725 --> 00:50:04,814
Come on! You idiot!

682
00:50:39,283 --> 00:50:40,299
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

683
00:50:40,393 --> 00:50:41,377
What can I do for you?

684
00:50:41,570 --> 00:50:43,361
Why, you said it yourself

685
00:50:43,533 --> 00:50:44,401
But you...

686
00:50:49,085 --> 00:50:52,085
Someone must have played a prank on us.

687
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:01,686
If we remain silent, we will be misunderstood even more.

688
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:03,944
We have to tell them the truth.

689
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:07,530
But Setsuko.....

690
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:08,898
She is the kind of person who doesn't mind things like that

691
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,366
She's laughing out loud

692
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,995
But....

693
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,773
why are you protecting such a person?

694
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,562
I'm sorry

695
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,650
But we haven't done anything shameful

696
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:29,585
I'm sure the misunderstanding will be cleared up soon.

697
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:31,460
That's good, that's good

698
00:51:33,047 --> 00:51:35,533
Don't show it off too much

699
00:51:35,632 --> 00:51:38,468
Dear Haruhiko

700
00:51:40,063 --> 00:51:41,592
Ah, I'm troubled

701
00:51:41,617 --> 00:51:43,624
Stop making fun of her.

702
00:51:47,190 --> 00:51:48,999
Don't be so arrogant.

703
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:55,389
What on earth do you think this place is?

704
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,140
Making love with a girl in a sacred school

705
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,186
We don't

706
00:52:01,627 --> 00:52:04,023
If you don't,Why are you two secretly meeting in a place like this?

707
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:05,326
Because I had business to attend to

708
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:07,241
Are students not allowed to discuss things with each other?

709
00:52:08,335 --> 00:52:09,288
Don't be so arrogant.

710
00:52:12,444 --> 00:52:13,431
There

711
00:52:18,006 --> 00:52:19,875
Hey there! Don't bully them too much, you guys.

712
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:21,420
Shut up.

713
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:23,100
What's the hell?

714
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:26,866
Are you complaining?

715
00:52:29,233 --> 00:52:30,421
Sorry for complaining

716
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,069
What's wrong?

717
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:40,280
You guys are slacking off,

718
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:43,850
You're just students and you're always running after girls

719
00:52:45,237 --> 00:52:48,967
Hey Come Grand, I will train you

720
00:52:48,992 --> 00:52:50,507
What's wrong?

721
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:52,576
What did you do?

722
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,596
What's wrong with
you guys?

723
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:57,296
Why are you silent?

724
00:52:57,321 --> 00:52:58,858
Why don't you say it?

725
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,146
Tetsuko was spoiled

726
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:11,676
I can't stand it anymore

727
00:53:11,746 --> 00:53:14,746
I'll tell the teacher everything

728
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:15,817
Wait, Tetsuko

729
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,264
Please kept that a secret

730
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,840
If they find out about that, I have to quit school

731
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,827
Please! Please

732
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:33,428
You idiot!

733
00:53:37,835 --> 00:53:38,812
Wait.

734
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:42,451
I'm in trouble

735
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:43,336
What should I do?

736
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:45,826
What did you guys do to
avoid this?

737
00:53:45,857 --> 00:53:46,702
That's right

738
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:54,702
Mitsuko!

739
00:54:04,858 --> 00:54:05,866
Mitsuko!

740
00:54:06,763 --> 00:54:08,163
I'm sorry about earlier

741
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:10,492
I did too much

742
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,496
I couldn't forgive their pranks.

743
00:54:14,226 --> 00:54:15,507
Mitsuko!

744
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:18,014
Where are you going?

745
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,093
Hiroko.

746
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,499
Did you come?

747
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:04,858
Ooi too?

748
00:55:06,577 --> 00:55:07,795
How is your health?

749
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:11,251
I'm sorry to wake you up while you're sleeping

750
00:55:18,102 --> 00:55:21,102
I just had a very strange dream

751
00:55:21,843 --> 00:55:26,186
There were hundreds and thousands of candles lit

752
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:32,163
Then suddenly the wind started to blow and they were wiped out one by one, and

753
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,465
 I felt sad

754
00:55:37,090 --> 00:55:40,090
But one thing didn't disappear

755
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,255
It didn't disappear until the very end

756
00:55:46,795 --> 00:55:49,795
Yes, I'm sure Hiroko has hope to live.

757
00:55:51,543 --> 00:55:54,598
Yes, that's right.

758
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,207
I'm starting to feel relieved

759
00:56:07,637 --> 00:56:11,324
But somehow Mitsuko-san, you don't seem to be in good spirits today

760
00:56:12,659 --> 00:56:13,918
What happened?

761
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,426
Something unpleasant happened

762
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:24,715
I thought maybe I would find the courage
to meet Hiroko

763
00:56:27,910 --> 00:56:29,637
But I'm an idiot

764
00:56:30,279 --> 00:56:33,065
On the other hand, I tried to rely on you

765
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:35,387
Yes, it's mutual

766
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,871
When I'm alone and just sleeping,

767
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:44,801
I start to think that it's really beautiful
that people are alive

768
00:56:47,350 --> 00:56:48,777
I wonder if that's true

769
00:56:53,879 --> 00:56:57,519
Hiroko is sick, but your mind is healthier than anyone else's.

770
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:03,012
But I still want to be healthy

771
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,690
Please enjoy true health for me

772
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,470
That's right, Jogashima is right there

773
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:17,027
Have a nice trip together

774
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,710
Have fun for me.

775
00:57:39,707 --> 00:57:41,379
This is the Bronze statue in the daylight

776
00:57:43,956 --> 00:57:45,502
What a great song

777
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:46,058
Did you know?

778
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:49,450
Yes, it was quite popular back in the day

779
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:52,691
Shall we walk there?

780
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:14,793
Yeah, let's go that far

781
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:22,988
Wow

782
00:58:23,013 --> 00:58:24,291
that's amazing!

783
00:58:25,262 --> 00:58:27,098
It's dangerous so be careful

784
00:58:41,916 --> 00:58:43,969
I love the ocean because it's so wide.

785
00:58:43,994 --> 00:58:45,270
I love it too

786
00:58:46,194 --> 00:58:48,879
I want to be a diplomat

787
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,955
If I become, I think I'll be able to see the oceans of the world

788
00:58:52,316 --> 00:58:54,136
Ah, now I understand

789
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,276
I understand why you are so passionate about English.

790
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,027
But the exam is difficult.

791
00:58:58,145 --> 00:58:59,262
Don't worry.

792
00:58:59,651 --> 00:59:01,878
Oi-san will make a great ambassador.

793
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:03,293
Don't be arrogant

794
00:59:03,528 --> 00:59:04,786
I really mean it.

795
00:59:07,372 --> 00:59:11,894
But I need something very important to become a diplomat

796
00:59:11,919 --> 00:59:12,477
What?

797
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:15,551
That's embarrassing

798
00:59:16,309 --> 00:59:18,019
Come on

799
00:59:18,504 --> 00:59:19,293
Tell me.

800
00:59:19,864 --> 00:59:21,262
I tell you.

801
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,200
I need my own wife.

802
00:59:40,864 --> 00:59:42,051
This is cold.

803
00:59:42,707 --> 00:59:43,950
I feel very good...

804
00:59:46,762 --> 00:59:47,418
Let me do it.

805
00:59:49,965 --> 00:59:52,334
It's not cold at all

806
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:54,168
Your cheeks have warmed it up

807
00:59:57,175 --> 00:59:58,332
Give it back.

808
01:00:12,691 --> 01:00:13,543
Did it hurt?

809
01:00:13,911 --> 01:00:14,629
It's okay.

810
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:26,528
Look, today's high school students are so in love.

811
01:00:27,142 --> 01:00:28,543
That's true.

812
01:00:42,024 --> 01:00:45,024
We can't be any closer

813
01:01:00,636 --> 01:01:01,429
Good evening

814
01:01:01,648 --> 01:01:02,346
Welcome.

815
01:01:02,468 --> 01:01:03,238
Aoki-san is here?

816
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:03,731
No

817
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,762
I completed the work

818
01:01:06,067 --> 01:01:06,911
What did you write?

819
01:01:07,073 --> 01:01:09,155
It's a true story
about a high school trip

820
01:01:09,362 --> 01:01:12,187
It's about first love.
Shall we read a story?

821
01:01:12,212 --> 01:01:13,551
Later is fine.

822
01:01:20,470 --> 01:01:22,527
Excuse me., but can you show me?

823
01:01:22,911 --> 01:01:26,340
I'm Komori of the literary world

824
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:32,738
I'm going to do a feature on new teenage talent soon, so I'd like to recommend you

825
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,699
Hey, really?

826
01:01:35,118 --> 01:01:36,035
Please

827
01:01:43,129 --> 01:01:44,270
You are stupid.

828
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:46,277
Did you really believe what that guy said?

829
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:49,012
Have I ever heard of The names of such magazines?

830
01:01:49,121 --> 01:01:50,231
No kidding

831
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:52,410
So why did he take my manuscript?

832
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:55,541
I'm guessing he's trying to blackmail someone?

833
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,620
Well, he's not that kind of person

834
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:02,430
What evidence are you basing this nonsense on?

835
01:02:02,746 --> 01:02:03,465
Nonsense?

836
01:02:07,246 --> 01:02:12,535
Aren't those two students actually
becoming a problem at school?

837
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:15,560
Well, I have solid evidence for all of this

838
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:20,646
What if the school's disgrace
didn't end up in the newspapers...

839
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,736
Well, 50,000 yen is cheap

840
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,105
That's like a threat

841
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:25,863
Even if you say that
if proper procedures are followed,

842
01:02:25,933 --> 01:02:27,569
you will be the one who is punished

843
01:02:27,778 --> 01:02:29,606
I  have the evidence.

844
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,820
What evidence do you have?

845
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,504
Here's the proof

846
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,652
You guys tell the truth

847
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,286
Why did you sneak out of Inn
and do anything?

848
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:47,308
Teacher.

849
01:02:49,942 --> 01:02:51,036
Why didn't you tell us?

850
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:54,690
Nowadays, rumors aren't just a school issue

851
01:02:55,426 --> 01:02:56,621
Your actions have been featured in the newspaper.

852
01:03:00,178 --> 01:03:03,178
Tsukimura-kun, I told you the other day

853
01:03:03,269 --> 01:03:04,769
The courage to defend yourself?

854
01:03:05,830 --> 01:03:07,756
please wait just one more day

855
01:03:08,441 --> 01:03:09,926
We haven't done anything

856
01:03:10,194 --> 01:03:11,340
Please.

857
01:03:47,697 --> 01:03:50,697
I just can't understand what you think.

858
01:03:52,088 --> 01:03:55,064
Why do you defend Tsuji?

859
01:03:57,480 --> 01:03:58,980
I'm sorry

860
01:04:10,131 --> 01:04:18,230
I actually received money from Setsuko's sister for our junior high school trip

861
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:22,160
If that's the kind of money

862
01:04:22,185 --> 01:04:22,856
I have,

863
01:04:23,676 --> 01:04:25,120
I think you should give it back to her.

864
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,646
I can't do that

865
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:27,769
Why?

866
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:33,668
Her sister asked me to make sure
Setsuko didn't make any mistakes

867
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:42,818
But I'm sorry

868
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:45,686
I've caused you so much trouble

869
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:49,777
I don't care about that

870
01:04:53,348 --> 01:04:56,801
Ooi-san, can you please transfer to another school?

871
01:04:58,379 --> 01:04:59,936
Unlike me,

872
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,756
you have to go to university soon,

873
01:05:02,781 --> 01:05:04,301
You can't stay the way you are now

874
01:05:16,077 --> 01:05:17,402
But If you do like this,

875
01:05:17,427 --> 01:05:18,707
you'll end up all alone

876
01:05:18,879 --> 01:05:21,441
It's okay, I have Hiroko

877
01:05:21,614 --> 01:05:22,184
But.

878
01:05:22,232 --> 01:05:25,785
You have a much bigger and more important future ahead of you

879
01:05:27,121 --> 01:05:32,277
Please, forget about the rumors about useless people and study for me

880
01:05:32,557 --> 01:05:33,988
Please

881
01:05:55,817 --> 01:05:57,004
I'll do as you say

882
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,530
But I have just one request

883
01:06:02,920 --> 01:06:07,590
I want to invite you to my house tomorrow as a final farewell

884
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:10,036
so I hope you'll come.

885
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:14,980
But your mother...

886
01:06:15,512 --> 01:06:16,215
Don't worry.

887
01:06:16,570 --> 01:06:18,426
My parents will be out tomorrow

888
01:06:19,147 --> 01:06:21,449
so I'm sure you'll come

889
01:06:24,567 --> 01:06:25,403
Yes.

890
01:06:31,637 --> 01:06:32,348
Welcome.

891
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:41,590
I'll give this back to you

892
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:49,182
Really? Then that's fine

893
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,918
But even if it appears in the newspaper, I don't think anyone will complain later

894
01:06:53,380 --> 01:06:56,380
Stop doing stupid things. If you stop doing such childish things, it will be a big mistake

895
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,121
Before that, I'll sue you for blackmail

896
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:10,902
You got carried away thinking you were going to settle things quietly,

897
01:07:11,707 --> 01:07:12,981
What are you going to do with me?

898
01:07:15,296 --> 01:07:17,215
You bastard!

899
01:07:20,492 --> 01:07:23,019
Go home now! If you ever show up with something like this again,

900
01:07:23,044 --> 01:07:24,520
you'll die!

901
01:07:27,113 --> 01:07:28,160
You'll regret it

902
01:07:33,485 --> 01:07:36,485
I'm sorry,

903
01:07:37,130 --> 01:07:38,629
He's a nasty guy

904
01:07:39,024 --> 01:07:40,473
I was in a good mood

905
01:07:55,496 --> 01:07:57,072
I made this coffee

906
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,106
Ah, I wish I had let you in

907
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:01,762
Oh well, let's do that from the second drink onwards.

908
01:08:03,192 --> 01:08:04,543
Don't be shy.

909
01:08:16,740 --> 01:08:17,696
What's wrong?

910
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,026
Why are you silent?

911
01:08:19,050 --> 01:08:20,816
Say something

912
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:24,730
You look like you did when I first met you

913
01:08:26,668 --> 01:08:27,629
But....

914
01:08:32,269 --> 01:08:34,230
Well, that's right, won't you listen to my piano?

915
01:08:36,281 --> 01:08:37,226
Eh? are you good, right?

916
01:08:37,251 --> 01:08:38,613
I'm not that good,

917
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:40,074
but please listen to me

918
01:08:44,246 --> 01:08:45,223
Don't come over here

919
01:08:45,248 --> 01:08:46,863
Go over there and close your eyes and listen

920
01:09:44,836 --> 01:09:49,137
Tsukimura-san, have you seen this newspaper?

921
01:10:01,028 --> 01:10:03,057
If something like this comes out,

922
01:10:03,082 --> 01:10:05,505
Haruhiko won't be able to go to school

923
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:08,166
He's become a laughing stock of the world

924
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:11,190
and his future is ruined

925
01:10:23,868 --> 01:10:27,613
He should have firmly refused to associate with you

926
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:29,863
Please go home

927
01:10:47,058 --> 01:10:47,965
Where's Mitsuko?

928
01:10:47,990 --> 01:10:50,160
Haruhiko,please take a look at this.

929
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:53,265
Aren't you embarrassed to be written such a thing?

930
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:55,826
And yet you still dated that person

931
01:10:55,850 --> 01:10:58,426
It's a lie, it's nonsense

932
01:10:58,450 --> 01:10:59,126
Even if you say that

933
01:10:59,150 --> 01:10:59,531
It's too late.

934
01:10:59,768 --> 01:11:02,230
Something like this was
written in the newspaper

935
01:11:02,293 --> 01:11:04,326
Who else can you trust?

936
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,350
My mother can't face the world either

937
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:09,176
Mom, why do you say that?

938
01:11:09,690 --> 01:11:12,690
You don't understand my feelings at all

939
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:14,805
What's this newspaper?!

940
01:11:15,557 --> 01:11:17,805
I'll go to school and tell them straight out.

941
01:11:17,830 --> 01:11:18,556
Don’t do that.

942
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:23,246
You should quit school and transfer.

943
01:11:24,514 --> 01:11:27,350
His transfer alone will not restore the school's reputation.

944
01:11:28,390 --> 01:11:29,976
This newspaper wrote an article like this

945
01:11:30,001 --> 01:11:32,254
Of course, Arikawa-kun will be held responsible!

946
01:11:32,869 --> 01:11:37,408
I ask the principal to definitely attend today's meeting.

947
01:11:40,710 --> 01:11:43,152
Where are you going, Haruhiko?

948
01:11:43,472 --> 01:11:44,918
You don't have to deal with me anymore

949
01:11:44,943 --> 01:11:45,738
Haruhiko.

950
01:11:51,864 --> 01:11:52,825
Ooi.

951
01:11:58,412 --> 01:12:01,003
Why are you so panicked?

952
01:12:02,900 --> 01:12:04,363
You must have had a fight with her.

953
01:12:04,905 --> 01:12:06,251
Mitsuko left on the previous train.

954
01:12:06,832 --> 01:12:10,894
Huh? I wonder where she went?

955
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,976
I'm sure she's going to see Hiroko.

956
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,871
She just bought a ticket to Kurihama.

957
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:41,246
Where's Hiroko Miyashita?

958
01:12:41,271 --> 01:12:43,316
That person passed away.

959
01:12:46,970 --> 01:12:47,683
When?

960
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:48,996
Yesterday evening.

961
01:12:49,860 --> 01:12:51,853
So She had it delivered to her house.

962
01:13:23,302 --> 01:13:24,329
Hiroko..

963
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:29,038
She was trying to live as much as she should....

964
01:14:09,790 --> 01:14:12,569
Mitsiko-san!

965
01:14:18,107 --> 01:14:19,280
Mitsiko-san!

966
01:14:24,503 --> 01:14:25,343
Mitsiko-san!

967
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:28,133
Let go! Let go!

968
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:31,061
Mitsiko-san!, you're an idiot!

969
01:14:32,584 --> 01:14:34,538
An idiot! An idiot! An idiot!

970
01:14:36,674 --> 01:14:37,140
An idiot!

971
01:14:49,246 --> 01:14:52,246
You're here after all,Setsuko.

972
01:14:52,999 --> 01:14:54,038
I've been looking around for a long time.

973
01:14:54,359 --> 01:14:55,046
Welcome.

974
01:14:55,310 --> 01:14:56,890
Did something happen?

975
01:14:57,623 --> 01:15:00,623
Aoki-san,you guys are so greedy

976
01:15:00,648 --> 01:15:02,594
Setsuko did something incredible

977
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,011
Setsuko, look at this.

978
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:09,137
You wrote this.

979
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:12,113
You did a terrible things.

980
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:16,166
You helped with this newspaper article.

981
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:17,214
You did something really terrible

982
01:15:17,777 --> 01:15:19,820
You're a big problem at school

983
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:21,615
You have to quit school

984
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:23,167
It's not enough to just drop out

985
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:26,780
What should we say to Ooi-san and Tsukimura-san to apologize?

986
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:33,339
You are idiot! You have to go to school and say it's your fault

987
01:15:43,551 --> 01:15:44,683
You.

988
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:48,297
I don't see Haruhiko

989
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:49,902
What should we do?

990
01:15:51,350 --> 01:15:53,396
What should we do?

991
01:15:53,420 --> 01:15:54,183
Fall down

992
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,466
This is the time to trust Haruhiko

993
01:15:56,490 --> 01:15:57,996
But maybe you...

994
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,626
that's not the case..

995
01:16:00,785 --> 01:16:03,076
If that's your intention, it's too late now

996
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:05,006
If not, he'll be living a good life

997
01:16:05,030 --> 01:16:05,675
But...

998
01:16:05,876 --> 01:16:07,312
We don't need to panic.

999
01:16:08,220 --> 01:16:09,386
That makes me anxious too

1000
01:16:09,410 --> 01:16:11,089
I'm so anxious I can't stay still

1001
01:16:11,438 --> 01:16:16,308
But please think of this as a test for parents, and wait

1002
01:16:19,152 --> 01:16:20,562
Sorry, how was it?

1003
01:16:20,587 --> 01:16:22,253
He's not coming to school

1004
01:16:22,278 --> 01:16:23,375
What on earth happened?

1005
01:16:23,835 --> 01:16:26,992
When I told Arikawa teacher that he left home this morning and didn't go back, he was surprised

1006
01:16:27,815 --> 01:16:28,901
He's in a meeting right now

1007
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,336
He'll come over as soon as the meeting is over

1008
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:33,916
If school is a place to teach social justice,

1009
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:40,280
I believe that those of us who work there need the strength
and courage to not give in to anyone for what is right

1010
01:16:42,315 --> 01:16:47,142
I will definitely take legal action at this point

1011
01:16:47,754 --> 01:16:51,291
Shouldn't we impose strict sanctions on fake newspapers?

1012
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:52,291
Hold on.

1013
01:16:53,689 --> 01:16:55,695
You immediately talk about the law

1014
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:59,010
The key is to quickly restore the school's reputation.

1015
01:16:59,940 --> 01:17:03,867
With graduation looming, it's not the kind
of thing we can take your time with in court

1016
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:09,400
The problem is how much trouble
some bad students cause to other students

1017
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,704
But this is fake.

1018
01:17:13,290 --> 01:17:16,996
So what evidence do you have to prove that those two are innocent?

1019
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,396
I trust those two

1020
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:22,056
Stop messing around

1021
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:24,038
Arikawa-kun, what are you going to do about this?

1022
01:17:24,312 --> 01:17:25,219
Calm down.

1023
01:17:26,131 --> 01:17:29,484
We have to stay without getting too emotional

1024
01:17:29,990 --> 01:17:34,009
It's about how to best protect the school's reputation

1025
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:38,314
Principal, you say that the honor of the school is the honor of the school

1026
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:44,752
Which is more important: school or the life of young students?

1027
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:51,236
I agree with Arikawa Sensei's theory

1028
01:17:51,970 --> 01:17:54,267
Why didn't those two tell the truth?

1029
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:57,088
I think there must be something to this

1030
01:17:57,560 --> 01:18:00,095
If that was the case, why didn't you make it clear?

1031
01:18:01,392 --> 01:18:03,603
It's your responsibility as the person in charge

1032
01:18:03,960 --> 01:18:05,033
That's right

1033
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:09,408
I too would not feel comfortable leaving my
child in the care of a teacher like Arikawa-san

1034
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:14,111
But I.....

1035
01:18:19,043 --> 01:18:22,043
Anyway,Please have the principal respond

1036
01:18:22,654 --> 01:18:24,755
Teacher, Principal...

1037
01:18:24,788 --> 01:18:26,110
We are currently in meeting.

1038
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,246
Leave from here.

1039
01:18:27,270 --> 01:18:31,346
Teacher, Principal, that newspaper article is all nonsense

1040
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:33,486
It's my imagination

1041
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:37,946
I was the reason those two were late returning to the inn

1042
01:18:38,216 --> 01:18:43,028
Teacher, please forgive me, I was stupid

1043
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:45,939
Setsuko,Thank you for saying that

1044
01:19:33,824 --> 01:19:35,368
It's cold isn't it?.

1045
01:19:37,896 --> 01:19:39,650
I'm fine.

1046
01:19:42,525 --> 01:19:43,564
Sorry

1047
01:19:47,140 --> 01:19:48,657
I'm hungry

1048
01:19:50,020 --> 01:19:51,052
Yeah.

1049
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:04,041
Eat this.

1050
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:07,040
What? You didn't eat lunch?

1051
01:20:08,290 --> 01:20:11,290
then, it's fine for me, you just eat

1052
01:20:11,915 --> 01:20:13,447
Don't worry.

1053
01:20:13,984 --> 01:20:16,673
You're hungry, right?

1054
01:20:17,658 --> 01:20:20,377
Let's eat half each

1055
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:22,814
Yes.

1056
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:38,728
Here it is.

1057
01:20:39,029 --> 01:20:40,259
Just a little would be fine.

1058
01:20:40,338 --> 01:20:41,259
Don't worry.

1059
01:20:46,205 --> 01:20:47,142
Here it is.

1060
01:20:55,711 --> 01:20:57,775
Right now, Our family are probably making a big fuss at home

1061
01:20:58,713 --> 01:21:00,595
We're both staying in places like this.

1062
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:03,617
This is a very good case for hoax imagination.

1063
01:21:04,446 --> 01:21:05,360
I'm fine

1064
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,329
I don't care what they say anymore.

1065
01:21:08,130 --> 01:21:10,589
It's much more important to live righteously.

1066
01:21:11,139 --> 01:21:15,432
That's right, It's absurd to defeat oneself.

1067
01:21:19,323 --> 01:21:21,555
Why did I care about dying?

1068
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:27,110
The Grim Reaper got so surprised when I slapped him that he ran away

1069
01:21:28,380 --> 01:21:29,044
Did it hurt?

1070
01:21:30,044 --> 01:21:30,685
No

1071
01:21:39,543 --> 01:21:41,190
It was a good test for us.

1072
01:21:42,830 --> 01:21:44,485
From now on, I won't lose to anything

1073
01:21:46,290 --> 01:21:49,290
That's right, let's both do our best

1074
01:21:50,275 --> 01:21:50,916
Yes.

1075
01:22:03,263 --> 01:22:04,556
Are you okay?

1076
01:22:46,818 --> 01:22:48,794
Ah, dawn has broken

1077
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:51,431
Ah, the storm has completely died down

1078
01:23:01,939 --> 01:23:02,806
Hurry up.

1079
01:23:11,193 --> 01:23:13,091
I feel so good.

1080
01:23:25,387 --> 01:23:26,576
Isn't it Setsuko?

1081
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:33,441
Come on.

1082
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:40,978
Ooi.

1083
01:23:47,842 --> 01:23:50,842
I found them.
Hurry up.

1084
01:23:58,171 --> 01:23:59,825
Ooi.

1085
01:24:05,388 --> 01:24:06,622
He's Arikawa teacher.

1086
01:24:08,741 --> 01:24:10,341
My dad and mom are here too

1087
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:11,927
Oh, my mom too!

1088
01:24:14,842 --> 01:24:15,982
It was just as I said.

1089
01:24:16,230 --> 01:24:18,516
Both of them are strong and not at all discouraged by this

1090
01:24:18,540 --> 01:24:21,540
Sorry, I really did worry you

1091
01:24:27,758 --> 01:24:28,725
Madam.

1092
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:30,954
That was good for us.

1093
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,623
I'm sorry

1094
01:24:38,210 --> 01:24:39,246
That's enough, that's enough

1095
01:24:39,270 --> 01:24:41,552
Rather than that, they must be hungry.

1096
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:44,135
Ah, Sendou-san, will you have a bonfire somewhere?

1097
01:24:47,601 --> 01:24:49,982
Come on, Call them both quickly

1098
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,120
We are going to have a party.

1099
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:03,177
Oh no, what should we do?

1100
01:25:03,839 --> 01:25:05,065
I feel so embarrassed.

1101
01:25:05,218 --> 01:25:06,657
but there's nothing we can do about it

1102
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:08,830
Let's be bold and apologize together

1103
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:11,545
That's right, we ran away from home

1104
01:25:12,580 --> 01:25:14,660
Oh, Setsuko has come

1105
01:25:15,291 --> 01:25:16,338
Mitsuko.

1106
01:25:16,820 --> 01:25:17,785
Oishi-san.

1107
01:25:21,456 --> 01:25:25,708
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1108
01:25:27,322 --> 01:25:28,409
My apologies.

1109
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,686
It's all my fault

1110
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:33,710
Can you please forgive me?

1111
01:25:34,410 --> 01:25:35,810
I'm sorry.

1112
01:25:37,481 --> 01:25:38,395
I'm sorry.

1113
01:25:39,080 --> 01:25:41,567
I'm sorry, sorry

1114
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,908
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1115
01:25:51,848 --> 01:25:53,387
Setsuko,come on, stand up.

1116
01:25:53,412 --> 01:25:54,087
We are not angry anymore.

1117
01:25:54,287 --> 01:25:55,293
Never mind.

1118
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:58,006
I'm glad.

1119
01:26:03,362 --> 01:26:04,162
You're stupid.

1120
01:26:08,740 --> 01:26:09,614
Hold on.

1121
01:26:09,931 --> 01:26:12,777
Hold on, Setsuko and Ooi.

1122
01:26:17,806 --> 01:26:28,780
THE END

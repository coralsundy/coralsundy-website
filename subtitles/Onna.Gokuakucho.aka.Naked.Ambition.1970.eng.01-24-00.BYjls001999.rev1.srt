Naked Ambition / Onna Gokuakucho (1970)

3
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:24,117
Come with me!

4
00:03:45,135 --> 00:03:47,659
It's urgent business!

5
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:50,409
What's wrong?
You are too noisy

6
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,213
Someone snuck into the mansion at dawn and murdered OKugata.

7
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:56,565
What?

8
00:03:56,714 --> 00:03:59,042
Okugata is safe?

9
00:04:00,214 --> 00:04:02,339
She's just got little injury

10
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:06,214
That's good to hear

11
00:04:09,106 --> 00:04:13,973
Please go back to your house

12
00:05:45,973 --> 00:05:48,036
It seems Okugata is safe

13
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:48,715
Yes

14
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:51,122
I will kill her later

15
00:05:52,723 --> 00:05:55,466
Security at their homes will be tight.

16
00:05:55,731 --> 00:05:57,200
I have another plan

17
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:04,036
I worry she gives birth male baby

18
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:08,676
We should kill her before she gives birth.

19
00:06:09,856 --> 00:06:10,333
Sure

20
00:06:14,716 --> 00:06:21,404
My boyfriend,Isogai is waiting in the yard

21
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:28,153
I can finally meet your lover

22
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:29,294
Yes

23
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:33,995
I hear he is as handsome as an actor.

24
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:38,878
What if I fall in love with him?

25
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:45,768
I'm just kidding.
He's your lover

26
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:57,505
Isogai, She's Oheya

27
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:03,372
I'm here to see you

28
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:10,169
We got ready a room for you

29
00:07:12,107 --> 00:07:16,161
We will hire you if you work hard

30
00:07:17,911 --> 00:07:19,021
Put your face up

31
00:07:22,707 --> 00:07:24,004
You're handsome

32
00:07:59,113 --> 00:08:00,535
Are you coming in?

33
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:06,230
I'm Rokusuke from Chugengashira

34
00:08:07,316 --> 00:08:09,136
I'm Isogai from Kamiyashiki

35
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:10,254
Nice to meet you

36
00:08:12,769 --> 00:08:14,902
You are from Kamiyashiki

37
00:08:15,402 --> 00:08:18,660
I know you would say I was left behind.

38
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,332
Kind of

39
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:30,520
KAMIYASHIKI is the front of the Daimyo

40
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:35,538
Here is the opposite of it

41
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,788
There's Okugata at Kamiyashiki

42
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:43,022
Here's his mistress house

43
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:47,483
But there might be chance for your promotion

44
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:51,795
You're still young.
You should get along with them

45
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:59,108
You are too thin.
You are unreliable.

46
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,603
You are overreacting.

47
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:12,400
I cherish these relationships.

48
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,142
I will never forget what you have done for me.

49
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:21,423
Let's work together

50
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:25,064
Then you can get married with him

51
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,197
Thanks

52
00:09:28,493 --> 00:09:38,416
He's 10 years younger than you.
How did you get him?

53
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:45,252
Are you prepared for hardship in the future?

54
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,549
I put my life on the line for this love.

55
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:56,684
It can't be helped.
You are over 30 years old. and this is your first love

56
00:10:13,295 --> 00:10:17,350
hell or high paradise

57
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:37,564
Teruchiyo

58
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:39,736
Welcome

59
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,609
That one is beautiful, isn't it?

60
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:53,227
I'm glad you are a boy.

61
00:10:53,735 --> 00:10:55,423
He's cute

62
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:01,477
he is a tool for women's advancement.
Let's take advantage of this child.

63
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:05,626
Look at that

64
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:11,884
Person called Matajuro Akaza is here to meet you

65
00:11:21,662 --> 00:11:26,396
Even though you couldn't kill her, you have the courage to come to this house again.

66
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,549
I'll try to kill her again

67
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,111
do you do it the same way?

68
00:11:35,136 --> 00:11:36,728
There is also the possibility

69
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:39,252
You should be honest.
You want money,right?

70
00:11:39,775 --> 00:11:41,291
it's natural to get money

71
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,040
I won't forgive your mistakes

72
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,738
Being women are good

73
00:11:57,575 --> 00:12:04,754
The people who lived in Fukagawa Yagurashita lived in a large mansion like this.

74
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:11,028
I would be happy if you could give me a lot of rewards

75
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:15,755
I have added you to my group.

76
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:21,856
But if you were killed in the upper mansion, you wouldn't be here now.

77
00:12:23,024 --> 00:12:32,328


78
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,375
your life ends here

79
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:40,610
give me money for hush money

80
00:12:40,813 --> 00:12:42,766
your life ends here

81
00:12:42,797 --> 00:12:44,453
keep your mouth shut

82
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:52,766
SHINDO's OGIN was originally a geisha from Fukagawa

83
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:56,416
Before that, she is a prostitute of YAGURASHITA

84
00:12:57,814 --> 00:13:01,572
He seduced the master of the Shindo family.

85
00:13:02,502 --> 00:13:09,330
She tried to kill his wife for the sake of his child's career

86
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,144
I will speak your secrets to everyone

87
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:15,081
To where

88
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:17,886
To whom?

89
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:26,162
you're begging for money like a beggar

90
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:28,357
Who can trust what you say

91
00:13:28,382 --> 00:13:29,724
do you think I have no proof?

92
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:38,846
I have to go

93
00:13:39,502 --> 00:13:40,236
Hold on

94
00:13:42,174 --> 00:13:44,002
You'll be honest?

95
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:51,319
I'm not so useless that women worry about me

96
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:25,695
I murdered him for the crime of breaking into this house with the aim of killing your life.

97
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,831
You made it

98
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,205
I paid you a lot

99
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:04,986
I just took some money

100
00:15:06,450 --> 00:15:11,263
I made you feel so good

101
00:15:20,973 --> 00:15:23,434
I'll go to bathroom,Umeno

102
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:42,544
I have a plan

103
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,348
Sure

104
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,747
Let's Add gentaku hosoi to our group

105
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:49,309
That doctor?

106
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:52,082
I’ll get the poison from him

107
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:56,169
let's give it to someone and use that poison to kill her

108
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,419
What do you think about this?

109
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:46,229
Thanks for coming.
It's been a while

110
00:16:55,897 --> 00:16:58,139
What can I do for you?

111
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:03,397
Today you will receive a request from OYAYA

112
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:09,350
I gave him the order firmly

113
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,803
I think it's good that there are many members

114
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:17,678
But I'm worried about GENTAKU's ability to do its job properly.

115
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:21,053
You really think so?

116
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,811
Better to murder the man who tried to kill her who went to the upper house.

117
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,639
I've already killed him

118
00:17:32,249 --> 00:17:34,702
That's good for us

119
00:17:35,764 --> 00:17:41,209
Please relax.
I will have Gentaku wait in another room if he comes

120
00:17:41,552 --> 00:17:42,380
Yes please

121
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:19,369
You're late

122
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,181
We can have fun tomorrow

123
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:25,728
I won't let you go home tonight

124
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:32,288
I worry about Gentaku who are good at flirting

125
00:18:32,992 --> 00:18:34,297
Are you jealous?

126
00:18:36,061 --> 00:18:37,686
You are so play boy

127
00:18:38,865 --> 00:18:39,803
You too

128
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:46,186
I gave my wife to the Daimyo because I have a bad temper

129
00:18:49,932 --> 00:18:51,026
Do you regret?

130
00:18:53,377 --> 00:18:59,752
You and me and Teruchiyo get together later

131
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:06,822
Control Okugata and Lord

132
00:19:08,096 --> 00:19:11,909
After that I will be Teruchiyo guardian

133
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:14,931
I will take over this house

134
00:19:15,783 --> 00:19:17,431
I hope it will happen soon

135
00:19:21,069 --> 00:19:27,062
The only person who knows about our relationship is that doctor named Gentaku.

136
00:19:29,212 --> 00:19:34,173
I don't know your relationship with that doctor.

137
00:19:35,642 --> 00:19:36,954
You are cheeky

138
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:43,158
Oheya let gentaku wait

139
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,057
So are you ready?

140
00:19:56,314 --> 00:19:58,361
I'll leave

141
00:19:58,642 --> 00:20:00,377
I see

142
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:07,372
Please visit me tomorrow night

143
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:49,053
I had a guest.
Come in

144
00:21:03,803 --> 00:21:08,499
Let's relax and talk tonight

145
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:13,981
we are old friends.
Don't hesitate.

146
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,450
It's wasteful

147
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:27,098
Did you read the letter I gave Umeno?

148
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:31,059
Yes I did

149
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:35,411
So I'm here to see you

150
00:21:37,743 --> 00:21:42,797
I'm always bringing with it

151
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:45,110
How about the item I asked?

152
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:53,578
it is currently being arranged

153
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:57,623
Please wait for a while

154
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,826
Gentaku

155
00:22:05,006 --> 00:22:06,576
I'm sorry

156
00:22:11,264 --> 00:22:15,740
We're in bad mood.
Let's have a drink together

157
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:44,306
It's been a long time since I've had a drink with you

158
00:22:44,588 --> 00:22:48,010
You were still young then

159
00:22:52,782 --> 00:22:57,798
I haven't changed but you have changed so much

160
00:22:58,918 --> 00:23:06,457
You are much prettier than before and I am very impressed.

161
00:23:10,172 --> 00:23:15,125
Unlike before, you have so much dignity.

162
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:19,829
I am very happy that you praised me

163
00:23:21,537 --> 00:23:28,131
GOKARO-san's kindness I think you'd like to forget

164
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,049
Yukie?

165
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:36,361
I don't want to think about him

166
00:23:37,752 --> 00:23:42,813
you have a relationship with him

167
00:23:44,117 --> 00:23:52,476
I know everything about you and him

168
00:23:59,883 --> 00:24:04,117
I see.
You might be right

169
00:24:05,906 --> 00:24:10,945
I was threatened by him that I would inform him of my secret.

170
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:16,743
I can't help but I had a little relationship with him

171
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:24,892
How did Makoto etc know about your relationship with GOKARO?

172
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:34,873
Whose child do you think Teruchiyo is?

173
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,126
He's not lord's son

174
00:24:39,493 --> 00:24:43,766
I was wondering about that

175
00:24:45,907 --> 00:24:47,892
He's Gokaro's son

176
00:24:49,142 --> 00:24:50,727
You're free to think about

177
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:58,642
he thinks TERUCHIYO is his son.
He wants to use the son in the future to raise his position.

178
00:24:59,829 --> 00:25:02,243
he gave me a good position

179
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:09,415
To be honest, Teruchiyo is your son

180
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:11,697
No way

181
00:25:15,962 --> 00:25:23,493
Only you know whose child TERUCHIYO is

182
00:25:28,243 --> 00:25:32,751
I am not cynical like you.

183
00:25:33,985 --> 00:25:40,649
Let's kill GOKARO as soon as possible and be happy together, the two of us.

184
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:47,095
I appreciate what you said

185
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:55,782
he can't live long.
you try the effect of that poison

186
00:26:06,876 --> 00:26:10,673
I get it.
I'm looking forward what happens

187
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:19,009
I will definitely give the poison you ask for

188
00:26:19,376 --> 00:26:20,782
Are you sure?

189
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:22,103
Yes

190
00:26:22,751 --> 00:26:23,634
I'm glad

191
00:26:32,767 --> 00:26:35,822
this poison is very effective

192
00:26:37,712 --> 00:26:44,025
If you drink this poison once, your body will become paralyzed and you will die immediately.

193
00:26:45,815 --> 00:26:49,620
Let's kill GOKARO's YUKIE with this potion

194
00:26:50,104 --> 00:26:52,307
I'll take this

195
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,487
Hold on

196
00:26:54,432 --> 00:27:00,471
I was going to give this to you, but it's my duty to kill him.

197
00:27:01,665 --> 00:27:04,743
I'll give you 1 package

198
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:08,290
I'll give you again if you need

199
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:12,556
I'll keep 2 packages

200
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:38,760
This is your reward

201
00:27:39,689 --> 00:27:40,408
Oheya

202
00:27:43,041 --> 00:27:43,978
no..Ogin

203
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:49,244
I want something more than money.

204
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:55,377
What do you want?

205
00:27:57,877 --> 00:28:01,823
You don't need me to tell you that.

206
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,323
You have to please me

207
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,401
what are you talking about?

208
00:28:10,949 --> 00:28:13,035
Don't pretend you don't know

209
00:28:18,729 --> 00:28:19,736
Gentaku

210
00:28:43,579 --> 00:28:49,243
you'd better take it easy

211
00:28:51,983 --> 00:28:58,069
I know your secret, so let's come to the bottom of hell together.

212
00:29:00,863 --> 00:29:03,293
It can't be helped

213
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:05,887
Do whatever you want

214
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:50,817
Ogin

215
00:29:59,218 --> 00:30:03,945
I have never forgotten your body

216
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,283
Treat me nicely

217
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:15,955
You have a nice figure

218
00:30:16,217 --> 00:30:18,592
All men excites about your body

219
00:30:20,842 --> 00:30:28,130
You're using your body as a weapon to seduce men

220
00:30:28,583 --> 00:30:35,786
The lord spends nights with you every day, so he won't live long.

221
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:42,342
Ogin

222
00:30:44,452 --> 00:30:47,420
I thought we were always doing something like this

223
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:50,795
I remember those days

224
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:57,243
I'll make you feel good

225
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,230
I heard the news

226
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,155
you are very suspicious

227
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:20,702
I get to know what you think

228
00:32:21,897 --> 00:32:25,327
Whose child is Teruchiyo?
you tried to poison me

229
00:32:26,592 --> 00:32:28,608
I was going to be deceived by you too

230
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,335
I worried a lot

231
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,465
I'm happy

232
00:32:50,356 --> 00:32:52,161
Hold me tight

233
00:32:55,678 --> 00:33:00,124
I am here because of you.

234
00:33:02,374 --> 00:33:04,389
let's work hard together

235
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:09,702
you can't even make a career out of it

236
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:15,436
I am still of low status.

237
00:33:16,296 --> 00:33:21,155
I don't care about your statues.
I am very happy if you are here

238
00:33:22,621 --> 00:33:27,856
I will go to a senior position in the future

239
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,809
let's work hard together

240
00:33:36,026 --> 00:33:41,096
I worry about our age deference

241
00:33:42,337 --> 00:33:46,266
I'm too old for you

242
00:34:00,075 --> 00:34:03,724
Please keep silent

243
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:30,569
Oyoi

244
00:34:40,354 --> 00:34:43,455
I have no money for you to gamble

245
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:51,000
You don't have to come here to gamble from Kamiyashiki

246
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:53,914
Please

247
00:35:12,793 --> 00:35:14,324
Welcome

248
00:35:16,941 --> 00:35:18,980
I'm counting on you

249
00:35:19,644 --> 00:35:21,410
I'll do my best

250
00:35:22,465 --> 00:35:25,668
we got the poison

251
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,286
who should put the poison?

252
00:35:34,977 --> 00:35:39,922
I have an idea.
There's a person called Chinsai Gokubouzu

253
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,743
He's Coward

254
00:35:44,813 --> 00:35:46,563
I'm not counting on him

255
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,852
I think it's convenient because he is loved by everyone

256
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:57,704
Let's threaten him with a knife.

257
00:35:59,071 --> 00:36:03,383
Do you think that will solve the problem?

258
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:10,446
I think you should try to intimidate him so you can control him.

259
00:36:13,523 --> 00:36:16,890
If we feel risk

260
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:51,764
We should kill her otherwise they will kill you

261
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:55,915
I feel scary

262
00:36:56,689 --> 00:36:59,689
I don't wanna die

263
00:37:21,381 --> 00:37:22,553
Brother

264
00:37:24,477 --> 00:37:28,883
We should tell to Okugata what Oheya plans

265
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:32,336
But..

266
00:37:33,047 --> 00:37:35,359
We should deal with him

267
00:37:36,609 --> 00:37:39,914
We ask him for money

268
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,758
What the hell you are saying

269
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,180
We can be rich

270
00:37:45,484 --> 00:37:47,203
We might be killed before that

271
00:37:48,812 --> 00:37:50,086
You are chicken

272
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:53,398
You always ask me for money

273
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:57,461
You really do it?

274
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,312
Yes I do

275
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:36,795
You have risen in the world, but you should learn more about geisha.

276
00:38:38,295 --> 00:38:42,365
Do you ignore us?

277
00:38:44,357 --> 00:38:46,248
Go back to lower house

278
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:49,810
Go back to lower house

279
00:38:56,629 --> 00:38:57,684
Don't frustrate so much

280
00:38:58,153 --> 00:38:59,145
Because

281
00:39:00,278 --> 00:39:02,723
You should have told them you were going to get back at them.

282
00:39:04,004 --> 00:39:08,449
Your life is just beginning.

283
00:39:14,091 --> 00:39:17,177
Actually,Lord is interesting in you

284
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,630
Me?

285
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:22,977
You'll be promoted

286
00:39:27,923 --> 00:39:28,813
Really?

287
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:30,391
Yeah

288
00:39:31,913 --> 00:39:35,523
I can promote myself

289
00:39:37,085 --> 00:39:41,671
And my reputation will be on the line.

290
00:39:43,427 --> 00:39:46,912
Am I your tool for your promotion?

291
00:39:47,779 --> 00:39:51,083
I might be your tool

292
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,576
I see.
I will take a revenge to them

293
00:40:04,148 --> 00:40:07,015
But be careful. lord might know who you were before

294
00:40:10,187 --> 00:40:15,015
From now on, we can carry on our relation

295
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:13,545
Look at this,Teruchiyo

296
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:30,104
Teruchiyo

297
00:41:52,567 --> 00:41:53,457
I tell you

298
00:41:56,230 --> 00:42:03,019
Hachiro Sugauma and Ujiie are here to see you

299
00:42:21,218 --> 00:42:24,054
Jodai ask me to do that?

300
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:25,757
Lord

301
00:42:27,522 --> 00:42:29,538
I don't wanna hear from you

302
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:33,218
I'm sorry but we should take care of Jodai

303
00:42:36,006 --> 00:42:39,139
Jodai is more important than I?

304
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,428
I'm sorry

305
00:42:44,553 --> 00:42:52,163
If you continue this behavior, we will have no more patience.

306
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:53,957
What the hell?

307
00:42:54,308 --> 00:43:00,425
You are killing innocents every day.

308
00:43:01,916 --> 00:43:04,791
Are you making fun of me?
Get out!

309
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:07,776
We hope you understand

310
00:43:09,127 --> 00:43:11,408
Anyone here?

311
00:43:11,471 --> 00:43:13,033
Lord

312
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:53,280
Lord

313
00:43:54,678 --> 00:43:57,717
Lord,calm down

314
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,509
Oheya and us are worried about you

315
00:44:05,962 --> 00:44:07,541
Shut up!

316
00:44:17,715 --> 00:44:20,801
Are they not working now?

317
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:26,527
Please do not hit them

318
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:34,830
If you settle with them, JODAI complains.
and they don't worry about die

319
00:44:36,588 --> 00:44:38,830
Bring Sake

320
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:53,268
Are you trying to settle with me?

321
00:44:54,227 --> 00:44:58,626
I am making calculations and taking action.

322
00:44:58,813 --> 00:45:03,235
I hear you have some weapon

323
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:12,552
Even vassals change their positions in various ways.

324
00:45:14,043 --> 00:45:18,528
Lord is too moody.
It's hard to calculation and taking action.

325
00:45:19,012 --> 00:45:28,519
I know.
We need to get Lord into retirement as soon as possible.

326
00:45:30,103 --> 00:45:32,924
Or we might get problem

327
00:45:35,134 --> 00:45:39,072
We may be destroyed.

328
00:45:39,424 --> 00:45:46,572
We are nothing if we perish.

329
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,618
We'll hold out until the next generation.

330
00:45:55,336 --> 00:46:00,969
We work according to JODAI

331
00:46:01,164 --> 00:46:11,140
I hope that lord will give in to our threats and become more mature.

332
00:46:14,641 --> 00:46:17,391
The future heir has already been chosen.

333
00:46:17,915 --> 00:46:23,930
Generation after generation, Lord's life will not be long

334
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:38,613
Hold on

335
00:46:39,128 --> 00:46:40,566
Do it right away

336
00:46:40,894 --> 00:46:42,870
You appeal to them

337
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:44,620
You can do it yourself

338
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:49,019
That's your duty

339
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,120
You get money from him

340
00:46:53,152 --> 00:46:55,167
Do it right away

341
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,074
I'll be killed

342
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:00,560
You say same again

343
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:03,959
You do or don't?

344
00:47:04,811 --> 00:47:05,647
Hold on

345
00:47:06,178 --> 00:47:06,951
You're man

346
00:47:07,678 --> 00:47:13,193
We can start business after you get money

347
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:19,303
I don't wanna die

348
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:10,351
Chinsai

349
00:48:11,476 --> 00:48:17,515
Traitor goes like this.
see how your sister dies

350
00:48:57,772 --> 00:48:59,038
You escaped

351
00:49:29,774 --> 00:49:34,157
Why you visit me again!

352
00:49:35,321 --> 00:49:38,539
I'm sorry but We need to ask you a favor

353
00:49:40,947 --> 00:49:41,658
Tell me

354
00:49:42,455 --> 00:49:46,049
she's trying to kill you with poison

355
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:49,525
we would like to dispose of Oheya

356
00:49:49,775 --> 00:49:50,314
What?

357
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:54,775
You kill us or you protect her

358
00:49:55,634 --> 00:49:58,150
Please choose

359
00:49:58,408 --> 00:50:01,377
You are too rude

360
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,306
Please listen to us

361
00:50:03,392 --> 00:50:04,470
Shut up

362
00:50:06,008 --> 00:50:11,250
If you want to kill me, kill me anytime

363
00:50:11,477 --> 00:50:16,703
I’m not afraid to die

364
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:27,187
I am not afraid to die, but I am afraid for lord because of my relationship with my lord.

365
00:50:27,485 --> 00:50:29,750
you are using him

366
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:31,055
Bring her

367
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:34,539
I feel sorry about you

368
00:50:53,849 --> 00:50:58,599
They want to kill me so we have to kill them quickly

369
00:50:59,847 --> 00:51:01,707
Use Chinsai

370
00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:11,543
I didn't try to tell her secret

371
00:51:11,823 --> 00:51:13,729
We have to kill you

372
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:15,690
Sorry

373
00:51:17,558 --> 00:51:18,190
Help me

374
00:51:18,215 --> 00:51:19,354
Stay down

375
00:51:21,724 --> 00:51:22,528
hold on

376
00:51:23,357 --> 00:51:24,435
It can't be helped

377
00:51:25,474 --> 00:51:32,036
I'll do anything please don't kill me

378
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:37,859
We're not counting on you

379
00:51:39,007 --> 00:51:41,507
You're useless

380
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:49,529
Don't get me wrong.
I'll do my best

381
00:51:52,427 --> 00:51:56,326
it's better than being killed

382
00:51:57,869 --> 00:52:02,799
I'll do anything please don't kill me

383
00:52:03,283 --> 00:52:04,744
please

384
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,002
What do you think?

385
00:52:08,471 --> 00:52:09,885
Well

386
00:52:11,931 --> 00:52:16,806
Okugara likes him.
so we can use him

387
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,665
You think so?

388
00:52:20,618 --> 00:52:25,173
Rusty scissors can be cut depending on how you use them

389
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:28,447
So we can use him in any way

390
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:33,798
It's better to kill him,Umeno

391
00:52:44,738 --> 00:52:48,918
Kill Okugata or you'll be killed.
Which one?

392
00:52:49,887 --> 00:52:54,637
I want to go for a long time, even one or two days

393
00:52:55,185 --> 00:52:57,615
I'll definitely kill Okugata

394
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:18,843
Use this

395
00:53:20,342 --> 00:53:21,217
Thanks

396
00:53:24,029 --> 00:53:25,037
Thanks

397
00:53:26,017 --> 00:53:30,446
I will never forget your kindness

398
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:37,502
Cut it out!
Don't get carried away

399
00:53:52,026 --> 00:53:54,112
Stop it

400
00:53:56,167 --> 00:53:59,339
They are arguing about Oheya's life

401
00:54:02,438 --> 00:54:05,954
are you going to commit suicide after that

402
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:12,898
are you ready for that?

403
00:54:14,632 --> 00:54:20,132
If you're a suicide corpse, we'll prepare for it

404
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:24,726
I'm not going to sell you flattery

405
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,220
It's not your business

406
00:54:27,025 --> 00:54:29,322
Get your hands off

407
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:33,166
Excuse me

408
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,236
I understand your situation

409
00:54:39,411 --> 00:54:43,067
I really want to fight with them

410
00:54:46,565 --> 00:54:47,526
What's your name?

411
00:54:47,886 --> 00:54:51,323
I'm Isogai

412
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:55,081
He's still boy.
Ok fight with them

413
00:55:25,084 --> 00:55:28,318
Kid, I'll kill you

414
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:19,925
He lost!

415
00:56:20,847 --> 00:56:25,698
You're interesting.
Let's have a drink

416
00:56:27,783 --> 00:56:30,689
Come here

417
00:56:33,314 --> 00:56:34,540
Take this

418
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:38,493
Hey

419
00:57:12,947 --> 00:57:13,462
Umeno

420
00:57:15,009 --> 00:57:15,439
Yes

421
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:21,150
I heard you are good at using swords

422
00:57:25,736 --> 00:57:27,986
Fight with him

423
00:57:33,144 --> 00:57:33,972
But Oheya...

424
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:35,073
This is my order

425
00:57:47,057 --> 00:57:47,690
Iyori

426
00:57:51,948 --> 00:57:53,065
I won't

427
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:54,798
Iyori

428
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:57,104
Sorry

429
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,379
Please forgive me

430
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:06,551
You must fight

431
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:18,890
Let's fight

432
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:05,113
Are you sure?
You're nasty man

433
00:59:18,207 --> 00:59:21,567
start now.
Everyone is looking forward to it!

434
00:59:24,004 --> 00:59:27,840
kill that woman,Iyori

435
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:59,122
I'll tell everything

436
01:00:42,602 --> 01:00:43,618
Iyori

437
01:00:45,243 --> 01:00:47,282
It worked well

438
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:55,495
Umeno wanna be your wife

439
01:00:57,104 --> 01:01:00,995
I really feel bad for her

440
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:09,499
she was very persistent for her career

441
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:15,612
I was frustrated about her

442
01:01:22,419 --> 01:01:30,341
Please treat me nice,Iyori

443
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:32,584
Ogin

444
01:03:35,587 --> 01:03:36,266
Lord!

445
01:03:38,977 --> 01:03:41,102
It's urgent business

446
01:03:41,579 --> 01:03:42,423
What's wrong?

447
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:45,969
Okugata at the Kamiyashiki died

448
01:03:48,126 --> 01:03:48,837
What?

449
01:03:48,926 --> 01:03:55,606
he was poisoned and vomited blood to death

450
01:03:57,033 --> 01:03:57,846
Who did it?

451
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:02,103
We don't know but Chinsai has run away

452
01:04:02,181 --> 01:04:02,861
Chinsai?

453
01:04:03,033 --> 01:04:05,838
Please go there

454
01:05:29,287 --> 01:05:34,303
Damn it!!!!

455
01:06:24,633 --> 01:06:27,906
That coward Chinsai did good job

456
01:06:32,383 --> 01:06:40,046
In the upper house, he must have slipped the poison in there, bypassing GOKARO's surveillance.

457
01:06:40,611 --> 01:06:46,924
Chinsai's role is over.
I hope Gokaro caught and kill him

458
01:06:50,487 --> 01:06:52,940
Gokato is just left

459
01:06:54,557 --> 01:06:56,276
How shall we kill him?

460
01:06:57,629 --> 01:06:59,520
you don't hate him,right?

461
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:05,137
he used me to raise his status

462
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:09,987
he sold me
I have no regrets against him

463
01:07:10,096 --> 01:07:12,432
If you say so

464
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:18,437
You are still young but good at teasing women

465
01:07:19,765 --> 01:07:23,218
Gokaro is useless comparing with you

466
01:07:24,448 --> 01:07:28,597
He's stingy and useless

467
01:07:34,246 --> 01:07:36,223
I'll kill you

468
01:07:38,264 --> 01:07:40,553
I had a feeling about it.
That's what I thought

469
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:45,756
I mist kill you

470
01:07:48,123 --> 01:07:52,053
Then I use Teruchiyo to control Shundo house

471
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:17,317
Help me!

472
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:20,770
Forgive me!

473
01:09:35,598 --> 01:09:39,004
If you kill me, you will be killed

474
01:09:40,059 --> 01:09:40,739
What?

475
01:09:41,637 --> 01:09:44,231
What do you plan?

476
01:09:51,055 --> 01:10:00,203
If I do not return within three days, they will receive a letter containing your secret.

477
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:02,976
You made a good idea

478
01:10:03,616 --> 01:10:05,007
I don't wanna die

479
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:10,677
We have no choice but to add him to our group

480
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:33,756
Thank you very much

481
01:10:34,404 --> 01:10:35,177
Chinsai

482
01:10:36,756 --> 01:10:40,029
If I do not return within three days,

483
01:10:57,181 --> 01:10:59,603
If I do not return within three days,

484
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:09,865
Thank you very much

485
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:40,781
You've all been cheating on me.

486
01:11:41,648 --> 01:11:43,351
I was watching you guys

487
01:11:46,523 --> 01:11:48,507
So what?

488
01:11:49,835 --> 01:11:50,428
what?

489
01:11:55,485 --> 01:11:59,282
life has hell and paradise

490
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:15,942
Damn it.
Kill him

491
01:12:20,707 --> 01:12:22,098
Kill him!

492
01:12:23,793 --> 01:12:24,848
Kill him!

493
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:26,793
Kill him!

494
01:12:30,878 --> 01:12:32,221
Kill him!

495
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:40,738
Kill him!

496
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:51,910
Kill him!

497
01:13:20,658 --> 01:13:21,674
Iyori

498
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:27,639
Gokaro yukie disobeyed your orders

499
01:14:28,756 --> 01:14:38,560
He confronted the lord, ready to be punished, and they died in combat.

500
01:14:41,294 --> 01:14:47,223
I think that would be a problem if the higher-ups found out about it.

501
01:14:48,106 --> 01:14:50,786
I think they will punish us

502
01:14:52,591 --> 01:14:57,005
Think hard about what happened

503
01:14:59,169 --> 01:15:05,052
don't tell anyone about what happened

504
01:15:13,143 --> 01:15:20,424
There is no choice but to make TERUCHIYO the lord as the successor to the Shundo family.

505
01:15:44,018 --> 01:15:45,643
TERUCHIYO

506
01:15:47,510 --> 01:15:50,658
You made Tatami dirty

507
01:15:58,403 --> 01:16:00,356
I'll clean up

508
01:16:12,743 --> 01:16:14,501
Let's play outside

509
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:17,259
TERUCHIYO

510
01:16:51,275 --> 01:16:52,182
Iyori

511
01:16:54,486 --> 01:16:56,267
You got your hopes up.

512
01:16:58,978 --> 01:17:04,291
I used Teruchiyo to control this house

513
01:17:06,619 --> 01:17:10,994
Can I ask who is his dad?

514
01:17:13,542 --> 01:17:17,824
Do you think you are his dad?

515
01:17:21,795 --> 01:17:22,748
I'm not?

516
01:17:23,982 --> 01:17:28,349
I don't even know who is it

517
01:17:57,704 --> 01:18:02,025
You tried to kill me too

518
01:18:13,683 --> 01:18:14,589
Iyori

519
01:18:15,602 --> 01:18:18,673
Don't get me wrong

520
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:23,415
Iyori

521
01:18:25,441 --> 01:18:26,683
Don't get me wrong

522
01:18:31,425 --> 01:18:32,573
Don't get me wrong

523
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,857
Don't get me wrong

524
01:18:52,523 --> 01:18:53,460
Iyori

525
01:19:04,114 --> 01:19:05,388
Iyori

526
01:19:43,343 --> 01:19:44,233
Iyori

527
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,435
Oheya

528
01:20:11,646 --> 01:20:12,357
Oheya

529
01:20:12,826 --> 01:20:13,748
Oheya

530
01:21:54,456 --> 01:21:55,464
I tell you

531
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,042
Okugata is alive

532
01:22:00,964 --> 01:22:05,948
It's not true that Chinsai put poison at him

533
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:08,417
You are loser

534
01:22:18,989 --> 01:22:21,294
I feel scary

535
01:22:26,598 --> 01:22:28,958
I was saved.

536
01:22:30,409 --> 01:22:35,948
They all have their desires.
Life is the most important thing.I'm the winner

537
01:23:37,439 --> 01:23:44,516
THE END

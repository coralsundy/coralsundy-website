Mountains and Rivers of Wounds
(A Public Benefactor/The Tycoon) (1964)

3
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,259
Hello?

4
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,861
Oh, it's me

5
00:00:58,017 --> 00:00:58,666
Yes

6
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,072
Is everything OK?

7
00:01:00,283 --> 00:01:01,822
Yes everything is Ok

8
00:01:02,017 --> 00:01:03,525
I'll be there around 5 pm

9
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:05,259
I'll wait for you

10
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:34,967
I will wait at 7:30

11
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:20,326
The bath is ready

12
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:30,029
Is Ikuo here?

13
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,342
Ikuo?

14
00:02:34,694 --> 00:02:36,061
You are strange

15
00:02:36,397 --> 00:02:37,787
He is Takeo,Not Ikuo

16
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,936
Oh yes, Takeo

17
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,334
Is he here?

18
00:02:43,647 --> 00:02:45,147
He is still in the school

19
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,373
You don't even remember your child's name

20
00:02:50,162 --> 00:02:51,990
You are such a cold father

21
00:04:59,031 --> 00:04:59,844
Hello?

22
00:05:00,227 --> 00:05:01,633
Yes..Ah

23
00:05:02,414 --> 00:05:03,680
I will call him

24
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:13,102
Yes. it's me

25
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,203
Are you chairman?
I'm Iwabuchi

26
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:16,844
I'm sorry to disturb you

27
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:20,469
I have two consultations, so please give me instructions.

28
00:05:20,664 --> 00:05:21,571
Ok, what is it?

29
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,352
One is about the apartment under construction

30
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,266
What happened to the apartment?

31
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:30,508
A representative of the anti-construction group wants to come to your house tomorrow morning between 9:00 and 10:00.

32
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:34,344
Who is running that opposition

33
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,508
Because when the building is completed, sunlight will not come in.

34
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:41,563
Residents from the north to the west are protesting

35
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:42,906
How many people all together?

36
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,836
49 people

37
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,601
Is it a house or a store?

38
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:47,360
Most of them are houses and stores.

39
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,203
Some of them are like boarding houses

40
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:52,844
In short,they want money

41
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,149
They say they wants money?

42
00:05:58,242 --> 00:05:59,531
Do they want us to stop the construction?

43
00:05:59,914 --> 00:06:01,828
It is a request to stop the construction

44
00:06:02,211 --> 00:06:02,703
I see

45
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:05,500
Ok, I will meet them

46
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,688
Tell them to come to my house at 9am tomorrow morning

47
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:09,953
Umm

48
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,203
What is the other?

49
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:15,500
The other is about Shigeya Ikeuchi

50
00:06:16,078 --> 00:06:18,633
He wants us to build a new train line,right?

51
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:19,578
Umm

52
00:06:20,508 --> 00:06:22,305
Let him meet Ryutaro first

53
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,805
Let's study our company for the time being

54
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,289
Let's do various things

55
00:06:29,227 --> 00:06:31,914
Ok,You can give him 10,000 yen just in case

56
00:06:32,696 --> 00:06:33,227
OK

57
00:06:33,953 --> 00:06:34,281
See you

58
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,649
He is coming back soon, right?

59
00:06:37,992 --> 00:06:38,477
Yes

60
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:44,860
Welcome back home

61
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,227
What did you do without turning on the light?

62
00:06:48,563 --> 00:06:49,922
Your father is here

63
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,047
Let's go say hello to him

64
00:06:55,563 --> 00:06:57,344
Tell him I have a headache

65
00:06:57,836 --> 00:07:00,297
Don't be too selfish

66
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:01,367
Let's go

67
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:03,672
A little is okay

68
00:07:04,024 --> 00:07:04,531
Ok?

69
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,031
Your father will feel bad if you don't go and say hello.

70
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:10,852
So please

71
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:18,422
Is school hard?

72
00:07:18,602 --> 00:07:20,196
It's not big deal

73
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:23,367
I see.
You are in the second year of college,right Ikuo?

74
00:07:24,563 --> 00:07:26,985
You also made a mistake in the child's name

75
00:07:28,078 --> 00:07:29,531
Oh, he is Takeo

76
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:33,727
What are you studying at university?

77
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:37,305
You asked the same question 3 months ago

78
00:07:38,352 --> 00:07:40,735
You don't even know what I study

79
00:07:41,735 --> 00:07:44,461
You named me when I was born, right?

80
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:47,461
Yes you are right

81
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:51,328
I do a lot of work every day so

82
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:53,203
I'm too busy to remember

83
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:58,211
I leave my wife to take care of your things

84
00:07:58,906 --> 00:08:00,961
Why are you always busy with work?

85
00:08:01,922 --> 00:08:04,117
Because I want to do the work myself.

86
00:08:04,633 --> 00:08:06,985
I think you don't have to make so much money

87
00:08:07,469 --> 00:08:09,289
I know You have a lot of property

88
00:08:10,242 --> 00:08:12,336
I don't work for money.

89
00:08:12,578 --> 00:08:13,860
So for what?

90
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:19,328
Generally, businessmen are doing business to make money

91
00:08:19,726 --> 00:08:21,468
So they fail in business

92
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:25,266
I am doing business for society

93
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:28,617
Therefore Society supports me

94
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:30,227
That's why I get my money without any effort.

95
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,797
The money I earn will also invest in new businesses

96
00:08:36,547 --> 00:08:37,336
Does it make sense?

97
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,867
What will you do after you graduate from college?

98
00:08:43,328 --> 00:08:44,805
I'm thinking of writing something

99
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:45,797
Writing?

100
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,914
How can you make a living with a job like that?

101
00:08:49,313 --> 00:08:50,203
I can't

102
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:52,196
Do you like drinking?

103
00:08:52,414 --> 00:08:52,992
I like

104
00:08:53,258 --> 00:08:54,156
So Let's drink

105
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,227
No thank you for now

106
00:08:57,156 --> 00:08:58,852
You should drink with him

107
00:09:00,586 --> 00:09:02,828
Are you happy,Dad

108
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:09,125
I've never wondered if I'm happy these days

109
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:10,063
Right?

110
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:15,446
You have lost the power to think about

111
00:09:16,274 --> 00:09:17,946
the important issues of human well-being

112
00:09:23,649 --> 00:09:24,930
So what the hell?

113
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,821
Have you ever thought about your wife's happiness?

114
00:09:27,906 --> 00:09:28,383
Takeo

115
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,094
Don't worry

116
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:32,641
Have you ever thought of my happiness?

117
00:09:33,313 --> 00:09:35,664
You just gave me and my mother money

118
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,360
My mother is a woman

119
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:41,641
You only come home once or twice a month

120
00:09:42,601 --> 00:09:43,828
My mother has been waiting for you

121
00:09:45,656 --> 00:09:49,664
Have you ever thought of her loneliness?

122
00:09:49,742 --> 00:09:51,086
Stop it,Takeo

123
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:53,313
I am a illegitimate child

124
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,297
Your name was not on the paperwork when I took the college entrance exam.

125
00:09:58,453 --> 00:10:00,891
I've grown up with a very narrow shoulders.

126
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:07,541
My mother hides your shoes as soon as you get home

127
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,572
She'd be embarrassed if anyone saw it.

128
00:10:11,877 --> 00:10:15,510
You have no idea how unhappy she is.

129
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,963
Business for society is good

130
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,736
I think it's good to build apartments

131
00:10:20,064 --> 00:10:21,338
It ’s also good to develop train routes.

132
00:10:22,361 --> 00:10:22,822
But

133
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,845
I have a favor of you

134
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,486
Please make my mother happy.

135
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:36,252
Mom

136
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,994
Will you break up with that father when I graduate from college?

137
00:10:40,697 --> 00:10:42,455
I'll get a job and provide for you.

138
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:47,900
You are still young.
You can find someone better

139
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:54,228
You just serve that guy now

140
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,369
He was laughing after you went downstairs

141
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,080
He says you are a strong and very funny guy

142
00:11:05,814 --> 00:11:07,494
He gave you some pocket money

143
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,791
He told me you go on a trip with this money

144
00:11:13,135 --> 00:11:15,119
Mom..I'm sorry

145
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,033
Oh, good morning

146
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:18,627
Good morning

147
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,072
It's bit cold in this morning

148
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,728
I think so

149
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,916
Snow was piled up on Mt. Fuji

150
00:12:33,588 --> 00:12:37,103
I slept on a new duvet last night

151
00:12:37,642 --> 00:12:39,095
Oh You received it

152
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:40,024
How was it?

153
00:12:41,306 --> 00:12:44,502
It was warm and I sweated

154
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,072
Warmer is better.
Did you stop coughing?

155
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:49,306
Yes

156
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:58,236
It tastes good

157
00:13:07,213 --> 00:13:08,252
Good morning

158
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:09,260
Good morning

159
00:13:11,212 --> 00:13:13,595
Did you give the pickles that arrived from Kyoto to my wife?

160
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,181
Yes

161
00:13:15,814 --> 00:13:16,806
What is Akihiko doing?

162
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:20,619
He gets up early this morning and eats with his wife

163
00:13:20,644 --> 00:13:21,166
I see

164
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:33,525
How is golf?
Is it fun?

165
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,150
Yes

166
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:39,939
It feels good on a large field and sunny days.

167
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:43,510
Would you like to go once?

168
00:13:49,135 --> 00:13:51,267
I don't wanna go

169
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:55,861
Our chairman has come

170
00:13:56,572 --> 00:13:58,306
Hello?
Take your seat

171
00:13:59,392 --> 00:14:01,572
I saw your opinion

172
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,010
I understand why you are against building an apartment

173
00:14:06,408 --> 00:14:09,314
I want to ask you something

174
00:14:09,931 --> 00:14:14,642
We announced 10 months ago that we would build an apartment with 1 basement floor and 7 floors above ground.

175
00:14:14,908 --> 00:14:17,025
You all knew that, right?

176
00:14:17,072 --> 00:14:18,463
We know that

177
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,541
So why are you guys protesting now?

178
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,908
Underground construction has already been completed

179
00:14:24,376 --> 00:14:27,735
If we stop the construction here, we will lose 50 million yen.

180
00:14:27,978 --> 00:14:30,213
What do you guys think about this

181
00:14:30,345 --> 00:14:33,744
You say it's a big loss if you stop the construction but

182
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,494
We don't mean that you stop all the construction

183
00:14:38,431 --> 00:14:41,064
We are OK if it is a 3 story building

184
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:44,908
If it's a 7 story apartment we disagree with it

185
00:14:45,213 --> 00:14:48,892
It ’s a little problem because it does not get sunlight.

186
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,775
Do you guys understand the current situation in Tokyo?

187
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,525
Tokyo's population is already over 10 million

188
00:14:55,752 --> 00:14:58,885
Furthermore, the population is increasing by 280,000 every year.

189
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:04,041
Tokyo makes a lot of metropolitan housing but

190
00:15:04,611 --> 00:15:07,845
The housing problem is becoming more acute.

191
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:15,040
So Our company is building a building for the people of Tokyo to move into.

192
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,947
Anyway, the next plan is one of them.

193
00:15:18,322 --> 00:15:19,361
But

194
00:15:19,946 --> 00:15:23,204
It's true that Our house will be in the shade

195
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,908
We can't accept it

196
00:15:27,099 --> 00:15:31,920
If you are going to build the apartment, I want to make sure you don't cause any trouble.

197
00:15:33,131 --> 00:15:35,670
See New York Paris London

198
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,982
The center of their city is all skyscrapers

199
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,099
Here is a big city with a population of 10 million.
Not suitable for sunlight

200
00:15:44,428 --> 00:15:46,911
You think it's common case?

201
00:15:46,998 --> 00:15:50,803
If you think so we will fight in court

202
00:15:52,756 --> 00:15:57,584
We are weak poor people, not powerful people like you

203
00:15:58,623 --> 00:16:00,881
But at least we will claim damages

204
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,318
You say you'll all be damaged

205
00:16:04,568 --> 00:16:07,021
But Did you calculate the profit?

206
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:10,607
When that apartment is completed, the number of rooms will be 312

207
00:16:10,998 --> 00:16:13,959
624 people if two people live

208
00:16:14,217 --> 00:16:17,474
The number of customers in your shopping district will increase

209
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:19,599
You can also raise the price of the product

210
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,107
You guys can make more money

211
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:27,572
If we pay for the damages

212
00:16:27,597 --> 00:16:32,127
Will you share your profits?

213
00:16:37,783 --> 00:16:38,416
We have prepared

214
00:16:38,486 --> 00:16:39,213
Thanks

215
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,088
It's been a whole

216
00:16:45,643 --> 00:16:46,760
Sorry for keeping you wait

217
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,635
This is a greeting from Arima

218
00:16:51,283 --> 00:16:51,768
Please

219
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:54,353
Please take this

220
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,635
We don't want this

221
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,033
Please take this for the time being

222
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,011
Please

223
00:17:00,222 --> 00:17:00,730
Please

224
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:03,480
This is just greeting

225
00:17:05,011 --> 00:17:05,628
Please

226
00:17:46,777 --> 00:17:47,332
Chairman

227
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:49,925
Our company is doing well.

228
00:17:51,168 --> 00:17:53,238
Everything is as planned

229
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:53,878
Yes

230
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,277
It's double compared to 3,4 years ago

231
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,753
Because the number of people living in the suburbs has increased

232
00:17:59,207 --> 00:18:01,339
It ’s because Tokyo got a fire in the war.

233
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:03,207
By the way

234
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:05,832
How is the construction of the apartment going?

235
00:19:30,793 --> 00:19:31,285
Managing Director

236
00:19:31,793 --> 00:19:32,988
Our chairman has come

237
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:34,175
I see

238
00:19:35,511 --> 00:19:38,925
It was close..then excuse me

239
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,058
Good morning, sir

240
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:43,894
Good morning

241
00:19:44,332 --> 00:19:46,722
There is a bus route change meeting at 1 o'clock, right?

242
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:50,269
Yes,The road plan for Tokyo has changed

243
00:19:50,691 --> 00:19:54,332
We applied for a change in our bus route

244
00:19:55,691 --> 00:19:56,457
Where is Ryutaro?

245
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:02,339
The president will meet with a man named Suguya Ikeuchi about the case you said in the phone

246
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:03,996
Yes

247
00:20:18,402 --> 00:20:19,011
Kazuo

248
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:19,707
What?

249
00:20:20,597 --> 00:20:21,394
Who was the woman?

250
00:20:22,128 --> 00:20:25,121
She is a clerk organizing the boardroom

251
00:20:25,402 --> 00:20:27,324
You don't have to worry

252
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,277
What is called?

253
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:30,527
Her name?

254
00:20:31,738 --> 00:20:33,964
Let me see... I think she is called Fukumura

255
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,026
You

256
00:20:35,253 --> 00:20:35,660
Yes

257
00:20:36,035 --> 00:20:38,316
Tell her to serve me another tea

258
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,097
Yes

259
00:21:27,527 --> 00:21:30,183
Will you organize the tools?

260
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:33,019
Do you have any work recently?

261
00:21:33,691 --> 00:21:34,972
any work?

262
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,003
I don't know

263
00:21:37,113 --> 00:21:39,269
You have some secret,right?

264
00:21:39,933 --> 00:21:41,464
I have no idea

265
00:21:41,746 --> 00:21:42,948
A strange person has come

266
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:45,464
I was asked a lot of strange things

267
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,074
What were you asked?

268
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:48,871
The business card is there,right

269
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:52,191
It's a detective station

270
00:21:52,682 --> 00:21:54,323
Whether we are officially married

271
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,316
How many years have we lived together

272
00:21:56,964 --> 00:21:59,019
How much my income

273
00:21:59,667 --> 00:22:00,691
I was asked something like that

274
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:05,519
He didn't ask about me

275
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:07,527
I was asked about you too

276
00:22:08,753 --> 00:22:10,472
What kind of person was your mistress before

277
00:22:12,175 --> 00:22:14,339
Who is your recent mistress

278
00:22:17,988 --> 00:22:19,683
Why did they come to find out?

279
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:23,785
They were asked to investigate by someone

280
00:22:23,949 --> 00:22:25,621
I wonder who asked

281
00:22:25,988 --> 00:22:29,956
Anyway, you're doing something suspicious

282
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,910
I have no idea

283
00:22:31,816 --> 00:22:33,519
Is it okay with cold rice?

284
00:22:37,449 --> 00:22:39,816
After all Those who came back from France are great

285
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,371
This painting is wonderful

286
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:43,972
Did you want to go too?

287
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:46,839
Is it ironic?

288
00:22:47,863 --> 00:22:48,816
Is there whiskey?

289
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,433
Of course no

290
00:22:56,863 --> 00:22:57,964
What are you doing?

291
00:22:59,394 --> 00:23:00,738
I will buy whiskey

292
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:07,605
Your friend Mr. Kanbayashi, Mr. Hakamatsu, all support their family

293
00:23:08,941 --> 00:23:10,363
Why don't your paintings sell at all?

294
00:23:11,996 --> 00:23:13,496
They are not artists

295
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:15,628
I don't imitate them

296
00:23:16,652 --> 00:23:18,019
Are you dissatisfied?

297
00:23:18,956 --> 00:23:19,871
I am dissatisfied

298
00:23:24,449 --> 00:23:25,058
I get it

299
00:23:51,941 --> 00:23:54,433
Did you meet Shigeya Ikeuchi?

300
00:23:54,644 --> 00:23:55,699
Yes I met him

301
00:23:59,222 --> 00:24:02,167
He said he wanted to meet the chairman in person and tell a secret story

302
00:24:02,738 --> 00:24:05,847
In short He wants you to make a new train line

303
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,605
I see, whereabouts?

304
00:24:07,855 --> 00:24:09,308
Oh but it's not good

305
00:24:10,136 --> 00:24:13,699
Our company looked it up 6 or 7 years ago,right?

306
00:24:13,724 --> 00:24:14,316
Oh

307
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:15,199
That's it

308
00:24:15,424 --> 00:24:16,838
Is there still a US military base?

309
00:24:17,191 --> 00:24:17,816
There is

310
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:18,581
I see

311
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:23,199
We made this small hot spring town the last station, right?

312
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:26,238
Oh I see

313
00:24:26,824 --> 00:24:29,519
This is a plan to connect to the railroad tracks of the Japanese National Railways

314
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:31,972
This is interesting to me

315
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:33,121
Ryutaro

316
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,206
Can you look it up in secret?

317
00:24:35,386 --> 00:24:35,949
Yes

318
00:24:36,605 --> 00:24:37,871
Don't tell him.

319
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:41,480
Get a new map along this line

320
00:24:41,761 --> 00:24:42,878
And look up the population

321
00:24:43,206 --> 00:24:44,761
What kind of factory is there

322
00:24:45,167 --> 00:24:47,503
Investigate the power situation and water situation

323
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:59,425
I heard your route plan from my son

324
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:02,027
That plan does not work

325
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:08,776
Our company made the same plan seven years ago and did a lot of research.

326
00:25:09,886 --> 00:25:13,331
In the end it didn't work and we abandoned it.

327
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:15,785
Why my plan does not work?

328
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,292
The train runs with passengers

329
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,316
Make money with it

330
00:25:20,996 --> 00:25:22,519
But how about this line?

331
00:25:23,371 --> 00:25:25,167
Rice field field forest wilderness

332
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:28,316
And there is a small town and a US military base

333
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:31,917
With this, even if we make a train, we only pay for electricity

334
00:25:32,628 --> 00:25:36,003
Carrying radishes and pumpkins does not make a business

335
00:25:36,816 --> 00:25:39,214
Oh..I see

336
00:25:41,214 --> 00:25:44,621
Why did you plan a train route?

337
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:47,339
Does it have something to do to you?

338
00:25:47,511 --> 00:25:48,042
Yes

339
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:52,956
I just want my land to be bought high

340
00:25:53,503 --> 00:25:55,152
And I want to retire

341
00:25:56,011 --> 00:25:59,878
So I thought it would be nice to have a train.

342
00:26:00,449 --> 00:26:02,644
I see, I get it

343
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:07,214
We can buy the land if it is cheap

344
00:26:07,675 --> 00:26:10,331
Because we are doing various businesses

345
00:26:11,144 --> 00:26:12,160
How many you have?

346
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,472
There is about 20,000 tsubo

347
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:15,417
There is a highland of 10,000 tsubo

348
00:26:15,706 --> 00:26:18,136
The rest is grassland

349
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:22,808
Will you buy it for 1000 yen per tsubo in total?

350
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:26,660
Let our real estate company visit the site once

351
00:26:27,308 --> 00:26:28,972
Please consult with him

352
00:26:29,011 --> 00:26:29,824
Yes

353
00:26:33,691 --> 00:26:35,027
Real Estate Managing Office

354
00:26:35,769 --> 00:26:36,456
Yamaguchi-kun?

355
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:40,167
Oh Shokichi

356
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:41,308
Can you come here?

357
00:26:43,581 --> 00:26:45,277
I want to hold an executive meeting tomorrow

358
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:46,074
Can you gather?

359
00:26:46,199 --> 00:26:46,714
Yes

360
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:49,167
Bus real estate train apartment all?

361
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:50,394
Yes All of them

362
00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:50,683
Yes

363
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:58,527
Please buy this man's 20,000 tsubo land as soon as possible

364
00:26:58,706 --> 00:27:01,019
He says he sells for 1000 yen per tsubo

365
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:03,019
Dad,Are you planning a route?

366
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:04,917
I don't know for now

367
00:27:05,394 --> 00:27:06,488
Please keep it secret

368
00:27:06,699 --> 00:27:07,230
Yes

369
00:27:08,136 --> 00:27:13,097
That line was investigated by us 7 year ago.

370
00:27:14,456 --> 00:27:15,035
However

371
00:27:15,363 --> 00:27:18,433
At that time, the development officer in charge

372
00:27:18,753 --> 00:27:22,199
Jinzo Sanuki, was planning the same route.

373
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:24,214
For our company

374
00:27:24,706 --> 00:27:30,292
We abandoned it because the route is unprofitable and has no future

375
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:34,480
Sanuki also abandoned it because he thought it had no future.

376
00:27:34,505 --> 00:27:37,347
How can I say...This is a problematic route

377
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:42,472
But our chairman reconsiders it again

378
00:27:42,497 --> 00:27:46,800
I think he has some new ideas.

379
00:27:47,253 --> 00:27:49,488
Please explain it

380
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:52,542
You're not learning enough.

381
00:27:53,042 --> 00:27:54,988
Things are different now and 7 years ago

382
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:58,316
Tokyo has a large population

383
00:27:58,964 --> 00:28:01,378
There are few places for humans to live

384
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:03,855
Moreover, the price of land is rising steadily.

385
00:28:04,292 --> 00:28:08,058
Office workers can't buy a house no matter how much they save money

386
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:09,761
So What should we do then?

387
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:13,769
It ’s also a political issue and

388
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:16,089
The life of the citizens of Tokyo is also a problem

389
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:17,542
Does it make sense?

390
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:23,066
So things are different on this train line than they were seven years ago.

391
00:28:24,324 --> 00:28:26,378
There's nothing on this train line.

392
00:28:26,613 --> 00:28:29,105
There are only rice fields, fields, forests, and a small town.

393
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:33,261
I think there is a future because there is nothing

394
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:35,996
Ok guys, listen

395
00:28:36,699 --> 00:28:40,949
There are many passengers in hot spring towns such as Atami and Ito

396
00:28:41,394 --> 00:28:43,886
But Who is really profitable?

397
00:28:44,605 --> 00:28:45,855
It's a hot spring inn, isn't it?

398
00:28:46,769 --> 00:28:49,542
Trains should not make a profit on their own

399
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:54,292
We have to make a comprehensive development plan centered on trains

400
00:28:56,464 --> 00:28:59,683
We can get to Shinjuku from here in less than an hour,right?

401
00:28:59,949 --> 00:29:01,464
Here is in the commuting area

402
00:29:01,886 --> 00:29:04,214
Build apartment complexes, build supermarkets, etc.

403
00:29:04,636 --> 00:29:06,996
Playgrounds and baseball fields are also good

404
00:29:07,324 --> 00:29:09,519
Orchard ,Natural Zoo

405
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:11,566
It is also good to make a golf course

406
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:12,503
In short

407
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,886
Passengers who once got on the train

408
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,015
No matter where they go or what they do

409
00:29:19,085 --> 00:29:23,351
Keep customers out of all our related businesses

410
00:29:25,468 --> 00:29:29,140
This looks like a trendy oil refinery

411
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:30,062
In short

412
00:29:30,554 --> 00:29:32,882
This is a refinery of everyday life

413
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,733
It would be great if this could be achieved

414
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,538
What about the funds?

415
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:44,944
Borrowing money from a bank or an insurance company is a great way to lose money.

416
00:29:46,398 --> 00:29:49,569
I'd like to discuss it with you guys today.

417
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,648
Each companies

418
00:29:51,765 --> 00:29:52,913
Or individual

419
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:56,671
Find out how much money we can raise right now.

420
00:29:57,007 --> 00:29:57,593
In short

421
00:29:58,226 --> 00:30:01,335
Suppose we raised 3 billion yen

422
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:07,124
I will buy up the land on this planned route with that money

423
00:30:07,437 --> 00:30:11,007
Buy 3 million tsubo for 1000 yen per tsubo

424
00:30:11,788 --> 00:30:14,085
Then the train route plan will be announced

425
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:17,702
If we get the green light from Tokyo, the land will triple in value.

426
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:21,827
So if we sell half of 1.5 million tsubo

427
00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:24,132
4.5 billion yen will be income

428
00:30:24,812 --> 00:30:26,765
This will fund the route plan.

429
00:30:49,678 --> 00:30:51,686
Are you Ms.Fukumura,right?

430
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:53,796
Yes

431
00:30:54,671 --> 00:30:56,069
I have something to do with you

432
00:30:56,094 --> 00:30:57,374
Can you come with me?

433
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:58,366
To where?

434
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:00,046
To upstairs

435
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:05,546
I brought her

436
00:31:12,226 --> 00:31:13,210
Take your seat

437
00:31:25,163 --> 00:31:26,233
Are you 28 years old?

438
00:31:26,437 --> 00:31:27,023
Yes

439
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,116
Do you enjoy your work?

440
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:34,819
It's not an interesting job.

441
00:31:34,844 --> 00:31:36,366
I'm just organizing the paperwork

442
00:31:36,843 --> 00:31:38,702
It's not hard

443
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,140
How much is the monthly salary?

444
00:31:41,108 --> 00:31:42,468
22000yen

445
00:31:42,765 --> 00:31:44,640
There are some other overtime allowances

446
00:31:45,015 --> 00:31:46,116
How much money do you have saved?

447
00:31:47,046 --> 00:31:48,921
5000 yen or 6000yen

448
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:51,687
Then life is hard

449
00:31:52,296 --> 00:31:53,327
Sometime I feel hard

450
00:31:53,866 --> 00:31:55,780
Your husband is Yoshiharu Sakai?

451
00:31:56,515 --> 00:31:56,866
Yes

452
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,132
Is he a painter?

453
00:31:59,702 --> 00:32:03,382
You and he are not officially married

454
00:32:04,663 --> 00:32:05,257
Yes

455
00:32:06,147 --> 00:32:07,381
You're not registered?

456
00:32:07,741 --> 00:32:08,101
No

457
00:32:09,257 --> 00:32:10,530
Why is that?

458
00:32:10,812 --> 00:32:12,882
It does not have any special meaning

459
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:15,304
You don't have any kids?

460
00:32:15,882 --> 00:32:16,976
Not yet

461
00:32:17,851 --> 00:32:18,694
Are you unhealthy?

462
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:20,804
I am healthy

463
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:22,358
Um

464
00:32:23,671 --> 00:32:26,608
How many years have you been working?

465
00:32:27,132 --> 00:32:28,648
It's been 8 years

466
00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:31,624
I hear the paintings he drew don't sell very well

467
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:33,148
True

468
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,499
I hear he wants to go to France

469
00:32:37,601 --> 00:32:38,280
Yes

470
00:32:38,835 --> 00:32:43,155
He says he'll get an evaluation after three years in France.

471
00:32:44,023 --> 00:32:47,210
He can't go because he don't have money

472
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:49,983
Shall I buy his painting?

473
00:32:51,358 --> 00:32:52,812
Are you buying?

474
00:32:54,546 --> 00:32:55,944
I'm glad but

475
00:32:56,726 --> 00:32:59,101
You haven't seen his painting yet

476
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:04,038
I have an idea like this

477
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:07,257
You are poor now

478
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,827
You are poor and support the man

479
00:33:10,804 --> 00:33:12,398
No one buy his painting

480
00:33:12,937 --> 00:33:15,249
If you keep doing this, you two will fail

481
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:19,827
You get tired and he loses confidence

482
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,280
By the way

483
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,741
To be honest

484
00:33:26,827 --> 00:33:31,835
I came up with this because I liked you

485
00:33:33,905 --> 00:33:34,562
Listen

486
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:37,679
I hired a detective to investigate you

487
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:46,030
You're happily married, and I have no say in the matter.

488
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:50,843
I hate making people unhappy

489
00:33:53,218 --> 00:33:55,843
You are in great trouble now

490
00:33:56,312 --> 00:33:58,398
But there is a possibility of breakthrough

491
00:34:00,062 --> 00:34:04,155
You and he will be separated for the next three years

492
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:05,335
In short

493
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:09,483
He goes to France for 3 years as he wishes

494
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:13,202
And he returns home as a wonderful painter

495
00:34:13,983 --> 00:34:15,702
I will buy his painting for the travel fund

496
00:34:16,523 --> 00:34:19,976
I will pay 150,000 yen a month for his stay in France

497
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:25,601
I will take care of you while he is away

498
00:34:26,757 --> 00:34:29,757
You could buy a much nicer apartment.

499
00:34:31,866 --> 00:34:35,546
We will be separated when he returns

500
00:34:36,335 --> 00:34:40,788
If he's in great shape, you're in good hands.

501
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,335
I'm sorry but I refuse

502
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:52,351
It's ok if you don't like

503
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:58,507
You should talk to him

504
00:35:00,444 --> 00:35:02,913
You want to make him a top painter, right?

505
00:35:03,765 --> 00:35:05,937
That is your number one wish, isn't it?

506
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,038
You have to sacrifice something for that

507
00:35:13,937 --> 00:35:16,124
This is a kind of deal.

508
00:35:16,632 --> 00:35:20,046
Moreover It ’s a deal that I ’m going to lose a lot.

509
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:25,421
This is something small

510
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:28,608
You have worked hard for many years

511
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:30,804
This is the reward for it

512
00:35:31,804 --> 00:35:33,304
Don't worry,take it

513
00:35:34,116 --> 00:35:36,694
There is no deep meaning to this.

514
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:08,312
Katsuhei Arima Buy my painting and let me study abroad in Paris

515
00:36:09,108 --> 00:36:11,632
He sends me 150,000 yen every month to France where I am

516
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:14,241
I think there are some exchange conditions

517
00:36:14,937 --> 00:36:16,312
I was so upset

518
00:36:17,171 --> 00:36:19,601
He said he would take care of me while you were away

519
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:22,163
That's why I thought

520
00:36:22,304 --> 00:36:23,937
I refused properly

521
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,741
Ok so This story is over.

522
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,616
I don't have to ask such a person to buy my painting

523
00:36:31,843 --> 00:36:32,483
True

524
00:36:34,398 --> 00:36:36,601
But I worry our life

525
00:36:36,976 --> 00:36:37,882
What are you talking about?

526
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:43,437
You can't afford to go to France

527
00:36:43,624 --> 00:36:45,069
There is no choice

528
00:36:45,429 --> 00:36:47,366
Take it seriously

529
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,663
I don't want to live in poverty anymore

530
00:36:52,546 --> 00:36:54,077
I think you are a luxury

531
00:36:55,015 --> 00:37:00,015
You are only thinking about going to Paris without thinking about making money

532
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:02,882
That ’s why you're often ridiculed by other people.

533
00:37:03,312 --> 00:37:05,163
I don't care what other person think

534
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:08,296
What do you think about me?

535
00:37:10,085 --> 00:37:11,523
I think you are lazy

536
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:15,483
I work hard but

537
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:18,546
You are being just lazy

538
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:22,030
If you go to Paris, I don't think you'll succeed.

539
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:23,968
You think so?

540
00:37:25,069 --> 00:37:27,062
Do you look down on me so much?

541
00:37:28,343 --> 00:37:31,444
You really want to be Arima's mistress, don't you?

542
00:37:32,358 --> 00:37:35,132
Then you don't have to live in poverty

543
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:38,390
Did you get money from him?

544
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:39,944
I got it

545
00:37:40,718 --> 00:37:43,023
But it's a reward for years of service.

546
00:37:43,827 --> 00:37:45,741
That's an excuse

547
00:37:47,546 --> 00:37:48,476
How much he gave you?

548
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:10,023
You want to study abroad in France,right?

549
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:13,850
Yes,I heard you were going to buy my painting for that.

550
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:14,983
I'm glad for that

551
00:38:15,351 --> 00:38:18,898
I brought 3 paintings today

552
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:22,358
Wait wait,I will see your painting later

553
00:38:22,851 --> 00:38:24,538
So..that woman

554
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:26,398
She is Fukumura,right?

555
00:38:26,423 --> 00:38:26,898
Yes

556
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:31,374
I talked to her the other day but she didn't agree

557
00:38:32,171 --> 00:38:36,648
I think you should talk to her again soon

558
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,366
Because I can't give an opinion

559
00:38:41,913 --> 00:38:45,749
My principle does something that benefits that person

560
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:49,765
I want to do something that benefits that person

561
00:38:50,218 --> 00:38:53,194
I want to make such a relationship

562
00:38:54,671 --> 00:38:57,733
Actually, I've been thinking about it for the last three days

563
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,679
Sometimes I was angry with you

564
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:03,718
But this is a divisive idea.

565
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:07,640
I felt that I needed a rational way of thinking that gave up my emotions

566
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,898
You're a big businessman, so you're thinking about things thoroughly.

567
00:39:13,093 --> 00:39:14,976
I'm so impressed

568
00:39:22,218 --> 00:39:26,171
We can't do anything even if we make a train line here

569
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:29,968
We can buy here cheaply because there is nothing

570
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:33,108
Business is to make a profit from nothing

571
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:36,280
A train is built in this town and an apartment stands

572
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:38,398
And here will be a cultural city

573
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:52,483
What, Kaszuki?

574
00:39:52,843 --> 00:39:54,023
chairman,Kazuki is here

575
00:39:54,874 --> 00:39:56,171
You sure? see carefully

576
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:59,062
I can't see it well because of the dust but

577
00:39:59,087 --> 00:40:01,398
I'm sure he is Kazuki

578
00:40:01,624 --> 00:40:02,678
I'm sure he is Kazuki

579
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,163
Why he is here..

580
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:05,796
He has a train line plan

581
00:40:06,023 --> 00:40:07,858
I know he can't miss this chance

582
00:40:08,413 --> 00:40:10,702
Only me and him can take this train line

583
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:13,358
There is no choice.
We will be competing with him

584
00:40:14,437 --> 00:40:18,265
If you want to compete, we have to buy land first

585
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,280
The license for the route is OK later

586
00:40:20,429 --> 00:40:22,960
It ’s important to buy up the land

587
00:40:24,562 --> 00:40:27,796
First, let's do a survey to form a specialized department

588
00:40:36,194 --> 00:40:38,093
Ah..welcome

589
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,679
Please

590
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,882
Sister, chairman is here

591
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:45,687
Yes

592
00:40:47,788 --> 00:40:48,351
welcome

593
00:40:50,749 --> 00:40:53,929
We were ready when you called.

594
00:41:00,233 --> 00:41:01,093
The bath is ready?

595
00:41:01,118 --> 00:41:02,561
I will check now

596
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:03,640
Take care of my cloth

597
00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:04,437
Yes

598
00:41:26,757 --> 00:41:27,702
Good evening

599
00:41:28,226 --> 00:41:30,530
It's rare you come alone

600
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:32,874
or someone will come later?

601
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:34,866
Yes one person will come later

602
00:41:35,538 --> 00:41:36,296
A woman

603
00:41:36,515 --> 00:41:38,382
Oh your lover?

604
00:41:39,429 --> 00:41:40,405
That's right

605
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,757
No way

606
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:42,991
That's true

607
00:41:43,507 --> 00:41:44,546
Who is she?

608
00:41:45,249 --> 00:41:46,687
That's not good

609
00:41:47,921 --> 00:41:49,452
Is Tomiko fine?

610
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:50,929
She is fine

611
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:54,398
My son is a college student.
He is very cheeky

612
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,398
But he is fine

613
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,405
I will check the bath

614
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:05,038
I know the Chairman better than anyone.

615
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,999
It doesn't matter if you're rude, but please tell me the truth

616
00:42:11,038 --> 00:42:15,796
The Chairman likes women who say things clearly.

617
00:42:16,928 --> 00:42:22,616
That's why the chairman loves the most selfish women

618
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,976
He is a mysterious man

619
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:48,733
Why did you call me here?

620
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,304
Well...I want to hear your story while eating

621
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:56,952
The food here is very delicious

622
00:42:58,093 --> 00:42:59,241
Do you drink?

623
00:43:00,038 --> 00:43:01,163
I can drink little

624
00:43:01,624 --> 00:43:02,546
I don't drink tonight

625
00:43:03,976 --> 00:43:05,452
Are you on the lookout for me?

626
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:06,656
Yes

627
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:09,617
You don't have to do it

628
00:43:10,062 --> 00:43:11,851
I don't do anything weird

629
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:15,578
Sakai visited me the other day

630
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:20,414
I don't know much about painting, but he's a good Yong person

631
00:43:21,335 --> 00:43:25,859
I told him that I would pay the travel expenses whenever the procedure for foreign travel was completed.

632
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,460
You bought him

633
00:43:31,085 --> 00:43:34,632
I think it's despicable to bribe person with money.

634
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:36,093
I don't think so

635
00:43:37,398 --> 00:43:40,007
I showed him the conditions and consulted

636
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,031
He promised to be happy with my conditions

637
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:46,109
This is a deal between us

638
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:51,187
I know I will lose, but I showed him the conditions

639
00:43:51,859 --> 00:43:53,234
Because I like you

640
00:43:54,898 --> 00:43:56,945
I want to buy you too

641
00:43:58,437 --> 00:43:59,999
You can always quit if you don't like it

642
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:04,398
I'm not going to fire you even if I quit

643
00:44:05,757 --> 00:44:10,812
You came here because you were also interested

644
00:44:11,906 --> 00:44:12,921
Why you came here?

645
00:44:13,515 --> 00:44:14,320
Tell me

646
00:44:16,117 --> 00:44:17,242
I just want money

647
00:44:18,046 --> 00:44:20,664
Ok..anyway come here

648
00:44:25,882 --> 00:44:27,710
What do you use the money for?

649
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:32,773
I don't like poor life

650
00:44:34,101 --> 00:44:36,062
I don't understand how I feel

651
00:44:37,484 --> 00:44:41,601
I sometime do not understand why I am alive

652
00:44:42,804 --> 00:44:45,171
It ’s like I ’m fighting poverty

653
00:44:46,796 --> 00:44:49,023
Even with cavities I can't go to the dentist.

654
00:44:50,093 --> 00:44:52,804
Even in winter, I'm cold because I can't afford a coat.

655
00:44:54,484 --> 00:45:00,328
It ’s not fun, but I just have to work to live.

656
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:05,320
I don't come here if I have enough money

657
00:45:07,718 --> 00:45:09,296
The rent of our apartment is also delinquent

658
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:12,968
I can't give birth even if I want a child

659
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:16,273
If I have a child, the three of us must starve to death.

660
00:45:18,367 --> 00:45:23,109
You know we don't have any money, so you bribe us.

661
00:45:24,679 --> 00:45:27,085
I think it's despicable to bribe person with money.

662
00:45:27,492 --> 00:45:28,226
That's too bad

663
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:31,046
I understand how you feel

664
00:45:31,476 --> 00:45:33,374
It ’s not good to overdo each other

665
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,148
I feel sorry you are poor now

666
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,203
But There are many poor people all over Japan

667
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:46,195
I'm just trying to make you happy

668
00:45:47,226 --> 00:45:50,343
Does my act look bad?

669
00:45:50,812 --> 00:45:53,031
If so, there is no choice

670
00:45:54,445 --> 00:45:57,968
Ok, then forget this deal

671
00:45:59,999 --> 00:46:03,796
Why did you bring me here?

672
00:46:05,101 --> 00:46:06,374
Is it bad to bring you?

673
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:10,093
You brought me here to buy me,right?

674
00:46:10,328 --> 00:46:11,257
That's right

675
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:14,156
Is it problem?

676
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:17,007
Then you gave up the idea?

677
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,398
Because you don't agree

678
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:23,187
Anyway there is no choice

679
00:46:23,609 --> 00:46:24,640
I see

680
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:29,203
Then it was no use for me to come here

681
00:46:29,812 --> 00:46:31,148
Yes it was no use

682
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:36,304
I came here because I wanted money

683
00:46:37,218 --> 00:46:38,960
I don't want to live in poverty any longer.

684
00:46:39,609 --> 00:46:40,804
I should die

685
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:45,054
Why do you stop this deal suddenly?

686
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,562
I understand

687
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:51,476
I won't do you bad, so leave it to me

688
00:46:52,796 --> 00:46:56,374
I will make you happier than ever.

689
00:46:58,406 --> 00:47:02,781
I have three mistresses besides my wife

690
00:47:04,218 --> 00:47:05,671
The two have been mistresses for over 20 years

691
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:07,468
and another have been 16 years old

692
00:47:08,179 --> 00:47:10,046
I gave them each a home.

693
00:47:10,304 --> 00:47:11,703
These women live an ordinary life.

694
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:16,195
People say it's bad to have a mistress

695
00:47:16,827 --> 00:47:21,359
But If it makes the woman happy, that's fine in my opinion.

696
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:27,265
I was very poor when I was young

697
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:29,695
Poverty is evil

698
00:47:30,406 --> 00:47:33,265
Most criminals in the world are poor

699
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:36,101
The world today is never good

700
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,202
The gap between rich and poor is too big in today's world

701
00:47:38,832 --> 00:47:41,004
A really good world is

702
00:47:41,933 --> 00:47:46,816
Even people without money can live a normal life.

703
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:57,285
My heart aches when I see young, beautiful women living in poverty.

704
00:48:01,785 --> 00:48:04,629
I feel like drinking

705
00:48:11,011 --> 00:48:14,331
He is Asao Hisayama, who was appointed as the land manager from the materials section manager.

706
00:48:15,598 --> 00:48:16,277
Thank you for your hard work

707
00:48:16,473 --> 00:48:16,981
Not at all

708
00:48:17,816 --> 00:48:19,770
Build a residential area by laying train tracks

709
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:25,176
We must first buy the land to develop it

710
00:48:25,731 --> 00:48:27,793
You are in charge of it

711
00:48:28,348 --> 00:48:30,871
It's the most important work right now

712
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:32,152
Does it make sense?

713
00:48:32,606 --> 00:48:34,160
Yes I get it

714
00:49:01,652 --> 00:49:02,340
Yes I get it

715
00:49:02,894 --> 00:49:03,527
Yes

716
00:49:06,418 --> 00:49:07,832
Toshihara-town 2012

717
00:49:08,902 --> 00:49:09,496
Here it is

718
00:49:29,981 --> 00:49:31,910
I'm sure you have 20,000 tsubo

719
00:49:32,246 --> 00:49:34,785
I have about that much

720
00:49:35,426 --> 00:49:37,910
Will you sell the land to us?

721
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:43,082
Around that hill

722
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:47,691
By the way, Can you really do train routes?

723
00:49:48,668 --> 00:49:49,481
Train?

724
00:49:50,098 --> 00:49:52,191
I've heard nothing

725
00:49:53,402 --> 00:49:55,574
That's not something we talk about in the company.

726
00:49:56,723 --> 00:50:01,074
I did a survey before and stopped because it wasn't profitable

727
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,082
I see

728
00:50:05,191 --> 00:50:06,863
Someone asked you about that?

729
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:11,684
I thought Mr. Arima would make a train route

730
00:50:13,316 --> 00:50:14,996
By the way, about the price of land

731
00:50:15,606 --> 00:50:19,152
You talked with Chairman Arima for 1000 yen per tsubo.

732
00:50:19,441 --> 00:50:20,020
Yes

733
00:50:20,582 --> 00:50:22,848
But was it a little too cheap?

734
00:50:23,262 --> 00:50:24,879
I think that's fine

735
00:50:25,012 --> 00:50:26,910
There is other buyer

736
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:29,856
He says he will buy it for 1200 yen per tsubo

737
00:50:30,949 --> 00:50:32,137
Is he Shinzo Kazuki?

738
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:35,668
I think Kazuki wants to buy

739
00:50:36,629 --> 00:50:38,066
Yes...well...

740
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,840
He seemed to want to buy

741
00:50:42,387 --> 00:50:44,871
So He has plan to build a train route here

742
00:50:45,363 --> 00:50:48,777
I don't know about it

743
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:53,496
But He often investigated the train

744
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:16,887
About buying your land.

745
00:51:17,004 --> 00:51:17,621
Yes

746
00:51:18,527 --> 00:51:20,652
He said he wanted to buy

747
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:25,973
So He said How much?

748
00:51:26,324 --> 00:51:26,785
Well...

749
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,879
Take your seat

750
00:51:30,777 --> 00:51:32,699
He said he can buy at 1200yen per tsubo

751
00:51:34,660 --> 00:51:35,527
I see

752
00:51:36,434 --> 00:51:38,582
You made 200 yen.

753
00:51:38,856 --> 00:51:41,566
Since it is 20,000 tsubo, it will be 4 million yen.

754
00:51:41,746 --> 00:51:43,293
Yes, thanks to you

755
00:51:43,318 --> 00:51:45,996
Sell it, he will be glad

756
00:51:46,551 --> 00:51:47,035
Yes

757
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:51,574
So he wants to build a train route?

758
00:51:52,043 --> 00:51:55,840
No,Arima wants to buy land because he wants to run a farm.

759
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:58,910
I see, he wants to run a farm

760
00:51:59,379 --> 00:52:00,457
That's interesting

761
00:52:00,621 --> 00:52:02,168
What kind of seed does he sow

762
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,481
So did you tell him I have a plan for building a train route?

763
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:07,176
Yes

764
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:10,762
He said the train business has a deficit

765
00:52:12,465 --> 00:52:16,270
He said having a train would be good for the farm business

766
00:52:17,598 --> 00:52:18,613
He is cheeky

767
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,059
Sorry I was away

768
00:53:28,277 --> 00:53:29,910
Where have you been?

769
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:31,043
To Haneda

770
00:53:31,223 --> 00:53:32,637
I went see him off

771
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:33,715
I see

772
00:53:34,574 --> 00:53:35,449
He has gone

773
00:53:37,129 --> 00:53:40,613
It's foolish for him to let go of such a beautiful woman for three years

774
00:53:42,832 --> 00:53:44,332
In a capitalist society

775
00:53:44,606 --> 00:53:50,262
Politicians are on the side of capitalists in every world

776
00:53:50,981 --> 00:53:51,559
In short

777
00:53:51,652 --> 00:53:55,652
It is the rich, not the poor, who support politics

778
00:53:56,074 --> 00:53:58,223
Japanese politicians have been so since the Meiji era

779
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:04,730
Japan's fiscal and monetary policy depends on large corporations

780
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:08,137
There is a tendency for capital concentration

781
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:10,332
Therefore, large companies and small companies

782
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:15,113
There is an inevitable gap between large retailers and micro retailers

783
00:54:15,613 --> 00:54:20,176
This disparity will increase as the nation grows.

784
00:54:20,879 --> 00:54:25,441
Here's a good example of the relationship between department stores and retailers

785
00:54:26,231 --> 00:54:30,215
In the case of eihoku department store, it was founded in March 1957.

786
00:54:31,004 --> 00:54:33,215
The president is the famous katsuhei Arima

787
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:38,223
Seihoku Department Store was founded in the spring of the following year after the department store law was enacted.

788
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,941
Of course there was opposition to local retailers

789
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:47,066
They launched a tremendous opposition to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and the Department Store Council.

790
00:54:48,082 --> 00:54:51,293
Department store law is a law for the government to protect small and medium-sized enterprises

791
00:54:51,746 --> 00:54:54,410
The government must deliberate nominally

792
00:54:55,004 --> 00:55:00,332
Of course, local ward councilors supported them

793
00:55:01,027 --> 00:55:06,129
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry did not have the courage to overwhelm the opposition movement and grant Arima approval

794
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:11,731
So the Ministry of International Trade and Industry called Arima and asked him to withdraw it temporarily.

795
00:55:13,145 --> 00:55:15,981
Arima got a week's grace and left.

796
00:55:16,606 --> 00:55:21,653
Then he interviewed seven retailers individually.

797
00:55:22,622 --> 00:55:25,528
He succeeded in removing them from the opposition movement

798
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:31,536
It was speculated that there were various black transactions

799
00:55:32,075 --> 00:55:37,973
Arima said it couldn't be extended once the two-year contract with the retailer expired

800
00:55:38,137 --> 00:55:40,442
And Arima demanded they leave.

801
00:55:41,426 --> 00:55:44,708
Arima controlled the protest well

802
00:55:45,176 --> 00:55:46,879
Arima successfully deceived them

803
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:54,020
Teacher, he is the son of Arima

804
00:55:54,161 --> 00:55:55,309
He is Yokota,right?

805
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:58,286
Heijiro Yokota's father is Katsuhei Arima

806
00:56:23,598 --> 00:56:24,309
Yokota

807
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:27,676
I hear you are the son of Arima Katsuhei, Is it true?

808
00:56:29,582 --> 00:56:31,043
What's wrong with it?

809
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,543
I am also his son

810
00:56:36,152 --> 00:56:38,371
So you may be a brother

811
00:56:38,402 --> 00:56:39,645
What's wrong with it?

812
00:56:40,613 --> 00:56:41,473
It's nothing

813
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:43,496
You think so?
I don't think so

814
00:56:43,731 --> 00:56:45,371
What are you asking me for that?

815
00:56:46,809 --> 00:56:47,926
There is no particular meaning

816
00:56:48,606 --> 00:56:52,707
We are in a common position

817
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,020
That's why I wanted to talk to you about things.

818
00:56:55,293 --> 00:56:56,613
There is nothing I talk about with you

819
00:56:58,184 --> 00:57:01,207
I just know you are the son of him

820
00:57:01,551 --> 00:57:03,957
I'm unhappy to hear it

821
00:57:05,332 --> 00:57:10,254
You just let me know my father play around woman a lot

822
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:15,910
I like my father, It can't help...

823
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:18,238
I also hate my father

824
00:57:18,879 --> 00:57:21,629
I don't want to hate my father anymore

825
00:57:21,887 --> 00:57:25,113
I want to talk with you more

826
00:57:25,902 --> 00:57:28,598
You seem to be escapist

827
00:57:29,442 --> 00:57:34,270
I can't talk here so can you come my home?

828
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:35,332
No

829
00:57:36,918 --> 00:57:39,262
My mother is his mistress

830
00:57:40,137 --> 00:57:42,723
I'm angry with him when I see my mom

831
00:57:43,371 --> 00:57:47,738
I don't want to see his other mistress

832
00:57:48,129 --> 00:57:49,098
I have to leave

833
00:57:49,223 --> 00:57:51,293
Do you know Seizo Hashizume?

834
00:57:51,481 --> 00:57:52,262
No

835
00:57:52,473 --> 00:57:54,559
He ran a bag shop in the Seihoku department store

836
00:57:54,707 --> 00:57:56,785
I see, I can't remember well

837
00:57:56,856 --> 00:58:01,395
In 1934, the Seihoku department store launched a retail store,right?

838
00:58:01,488 --> 00:58:05,371
The contract expired so I asked them to go out

839
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:07,621
Seizo Hashizume is one of them

840
00:58:07,965 --> 00:58:08,809
I see

841
00:58:09,231 --> 00:58:10,684
He committed suicide by train last night

842
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:14,613
The reason was that he couldn't open the store because he was kicked out of the department store.

843
00:58:14,934 --> 00:58:17,262
He suffered and became mentally ill

844
00:58:17,621 --> 00:58:18,574
Do you have any thoughts?

845
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:19,715
What do you mean?

846
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,895
I think his suicide is your responsibility

847
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:29,168
We work under the department store law created by the government

848
00:58:29,770 --> 00:58:32,910
I think the responsibility for that lies with the government.

849
00:58:33,817 --> 00:58:36,965
For example, do brokerage firms take responsibility when a stock crashes?

850
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:43,027
Will the bicycle promotion association take responsibility for those who commit suicide after losing a bicycle race?

851
00:58:43,246 --> 00:58:45,293
But morally I think you are responsible

852
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:49,809
Excellent products from the United States may enter Japan and Japanese manufacturers may go bankrupt

853
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,699
The business world is very competitive.

854
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,434
Do you go to his funeral?

855
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,285
I won't go

856
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,934
Do you want to send someone else to do it?

857
00:58:57,996 --> 00:58:58,926
No

858
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:30,379
Oh you, it's a problem!

859
00:59:30,404 --> 00:59:32,613
Akihiko goes crazy after evening

860
00:59:32,638 --> 00:59:34,012
Kazuo is here now

861
00:59:34,770 --> 00:59:36,215
Is it his usual illness again?

862
00:59:37,871 --> 00:59:39,731
Just leave it, It's not big deal

863
00:59:43,957 --> 00:59:47,442
Don't you love him at all?

864
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:49,238
Don't ask me stupid things

865
00:59:50,199 --> 00:59:54,106
I like Ryutaro,Junko,Setsuko and Akihiko

866
00:59:55,012 --> 00:59:58,847
Then think about Akihiko a little more

867
00:59:59,348 --> 01:00:00,488
He is no use

868
01:00:01,434 --> 01:00:04,410
Isn't your useless son adorable?

869
01:00:05,027 --> 01:00:09,582
You said you like him but I think you forsake him

870
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:14,925
He is amnestic.
He can't work properly

871
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,605
It's just a random job.
There's work he can do.

872
01:00:20,121 --> 01:00:25,402
He is amnestic because you got him to work in a department store for a responsible job

873
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,152
You ruin humans

874
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:32,449
He has a weak spirit so he can't do any work

875
01:00:33,136 --> 01:00:34,535
You are no use too

876
01:00:35,066 --> 01:00:37,871
It ’s your fault that he ’s not good.

877
01:00:45,496 --> 01:00:46,918
Kazuo brother

878
01:00:48,423 --> 01:00:51,469
Can I burn incense from now on?

879
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:55,126
I should buy flowers

880
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:58,563
I know you liked white flower

881
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:01,618
Is red flower bad?

882
01:01:02,602 --> 01:01:03,469
Is that right?

883
01:01:05,751 --> 01:01:06,977
white flower

884
01:01:08,532 --> 01:01:09,688
What would you like?

885
01:01:13,157 --> 01:01:13,907
Akihiko-kun

886
01:01:14,977 --> 01:01:16,087
It's not your fault

887
01:01:19,118 --> 01:01:23,016
You were the eviction clerk at that time

888
01:01:24,024 --> 01:01:24,829
It was very terrible

889
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:31,290
If the war is a mass murder by the state, it's a legal fraud

890
01:01:33,899 --> 01:01:36,594
You are much purer than us

891
01:01:38,258 --> 01:01:40,727
Brother...white flower

892
01:01:41,837 --> 01:01:42,891
What is better?

893
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:46,016
Actually There is a serious incident

894
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,227
I think I should talk to you directly

895
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:53,383
I think the order is different.
But Please consider

896
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,610
Ok tell me

897
01:01:57,337 --> 01:02:00,477
My college friend works for the Ministry of Transport

898
01:02:01,274 --> 01:02:03,243
He contacted me secretly

899
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:07,618
Regarding the train license from Takiyama Station to Mategi Station

900
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:10,852
Kazuki Shizo seems to have applied for a license to the transportation office.

901
01:02:11,329 --> 01:02:16,110
You've been waiting for me since the morning to make that report me?

902
01:02:16,626 --> 01:02:18,860
Yes, I thought it is very important issue

903
01:02:19,141 --> 01:02:20,751
You are the land manager,right?

904
01:02:20,907 --> 01:02:21,313
Yes

905
01:02:21,626 --> 01:02:23,782
What is the land manager's work?

906
01:02:24,196 --> 01:02:24,743
Yes

907
01:02:25,454 --> 01:02:28,462
What about land acquisition? I heard that it is not progressing

908
01:02:29,304 --> 01:02:29,711
Sorry

909
01:02:31,501 --> 01:02:35,149
I know he submitted the application since yesterday morning

910
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:36,368
What?

911
01:02:36,516 --> 01:02:37,719
You go to the site!

912
01:02:38,641 --> 01:02:40,462
Only one contact person should be at the head office

913
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,868
You may stay there to buy the land

914
01:02:44,337 --> 01:02:44,860
Understand?

915
01:02:45,712 --> 01:02:46,641
Buy 1 million tsubo

916
01:02:47,165 --> 01:02:47,508
Yes

917
01:03:14,368 --> 01:03:16,329
Hey,Please call the chairman as soon as possible

918
01:03:16,383 --> 01:03:21,102
I know how you feel but Half of your land is thickets and the rest are fields

919
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:24,376
Excuse me, but how much is your annual income?

920
01:03:24,532 --> 01:03:27,626
If you sell that 5000 tsubo for 2000 yen, it will be 10 million yen.

921
01:03:27,907 --> 01:03:30,516
Even if you manage 10 million yen at 6% per year, it is 600,000 yen.

922
01:03:30,594 --> 01:03:31,633
You make a profit of 50,000 yen every month

923
01:03:32,032 --> 01:03:34,946
The monthly income of 50,000 yen is big

924
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:36,985
Hello? Is that chairman?

925
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:39,977
This is Hisayama speaking.
A lot of land brokers in Tokyo came

926
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,813
Landlords are getting bullish

927
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:44,837
Give them something

928
01:03:45,438 --> 01:03:49,079
If they like alcohol, bring 10 foreign whiskeys

929
01:03:49,727 --> 01:03:52,696
Give his wife a kimono or something

930
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,430
Give a present that makes his wife happy

931
01:03:56,844 --> 01:04:01,282
If we can get a lot of land at once, it's a cheap cost

932
01:04:01,454 --> 01:04:03,251
Yes, I'll try

933
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:07,344
Takeyama site office

934
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,235
Wait a min

935
01:04:09,618 --> 01:04:11,118
Department cheif, phone call for you

936
01:04:13,165 --> 01:04:14,235
Hello? What can I do for you?

937
01:04:14,469 --> 01:04:16,915
Can you go home now?

938
01:04:17,032 --> 01:04:18,110
What's wrong?

939
01:04:18,844 --> 01:04:23,445
I don't want to be with my mother anymore

940
01:04:25,352 --> 01:04:27,110
I will take my child back to my hometown

941
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:31,586
There is only one Yuichi at home so please go home early

942
01:04:31,813 --> 01:04:33,196
I don't know what are you talking about

943
01:04:34,032 --> 01:04:35,337
Did you fight with our mother?

944
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:39,493
You know what your mother looks like

945
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,501
Have you stopped renting other apartments?

946
01:04:42,923 --> 01:04:44,540
I'm too busy now

947
01:04:44,837 --> 01:04:46,696
I'll be back in 3 days so please wait

948
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,805
Then I will go home

949
01:04:50,282 --> 01:04:51,798
I'm looking for an apartment now

950
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,813
I try to separate to live from my mom when I'm done with my work

951
01:04:56,258 --> 01:04:59,196
You think I'm wrong?

952
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:01,907
You think your mother is right?

953
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,493
I understand!

954
01:05:53,923 --> 01:05:57,212
In other words, payment is postponed and money is made

955
01:05:57,673 --> 01:05:59,977
And Use another payment for it

956
01:06:00,477 --> 01:06:02,743
And fill it with another payment

957
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:06,243
This way you will be forever profitable

958
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:08,946
That's how you buy and sell land

959
01:06:09,243 --> 01:06:12,469
This makes money without bothering anyone

960
01:06:12,993 --> 01:06:14,743
You can buy an apartment right away

961
01:06:15,602 --> 01:06:19,204
You are busy.
You have a hard time with a house problem

962
01:06:21,087 --> 01:06:24,657
I can talk to Mr.Kazuki if you are interested

963
01:06:25,555 --> 01:06:28,274
But I want half the profit

964
01:06:37,298 --> 01:06:39,579
(Buddhist sutra)

965
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:19,081
I'm sorry.
Our chairman worry about you

966
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,948
Thank you for your concern

967
01:07:21,511 --> 01:07:25,565
You were too busy to take care of your house

968
01:07:26,401 --> 01:07:27,901
I also feel responsible

969
01:07:28,050 --> 01:07:29,589
You don't have to

970
01:07:30,769 --> 01:07:34,464
You should do another job for a while

971
01:07:35,331 --> 01:07:37,073
I know you've been through a lot.

972
01:07:37,581 --> 01:07:39,003
I'll be fine

973
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:41,659
I'm alone now, so I can work hard

974
01:07:43,276 --> 01:07:45,065
He said he is alone now, so he can work hard

975
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,284
That's not good,Let him other work

976
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:49,995
There are many bad conditions

977
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,800
His family is not good.

978
01:07:52,347 --> 01:07:56,136
Let him other work and bring young worker from estate department

979
01:07:56,245 --> 01:07:58,456
The last one or two months are important

980
01:08:00,456 --> 01:08:03,292
You have been transferred to the labor department

981
01:08:04,097 --> 01:08:05,956
I can't accept it

982
01:08:06,269 --> 01:08:08,058
It has been decided

983
01:08:09,675 --> 01:08:13,620
Work is still in progress.
No one understand my work

984
01:08:14,362 --> 01:08:18,229
I have various promises.
It won't work if I leave

985
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:21,894
We already have a replacement in the field.

986
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:24,315
Has it been decided?

987
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:30,347
I want to go to the labor department after taking over the office work

988
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:33,237
I wish I could have money...

989
01:08:34,159 --> 01:08:38,769
I could control my company's money and buy the land you bought...

990
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:42,948
I have invested all my money in the land

991
01:08:46,112 --> 01:08:49,925
In a few days I have to pay back 2 million yen to the company or there will be a hole in the books.

992
01:08:50,987 --> 01:08:54,144
Ikeyoshi-san
Can you ask Mr.kazuki to take care of my issue?

993
01:08:54,854 --> 01:08:55,761
Please

994
01:08:56,222 --> 01:08:59,940
I don't have to buy these small lands

995
01:09:00,276 --> 01:09:00,831
I see

996
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:04,698
There is something wrong with this land

997
01:09:05,229 --> 01:09:05,675
Yes

998
01:09:06,878 --> 01:09:10,222
Mr. Arita's land manager is eager to sell.

999
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:11,378
I won't buy

1000
01:09:11,995 --> 01:09:14,784
I don't want to be seen by Arima with strange eyes

1001
01:09:45,987 --> 01:09:46,964
Ah, are you chairman?

1002
01:09:47,612 --> 01:09:51,948
He was debilitated because his wife committed suicide a week ago.

1003
01:09:52,612 --> 01:09:55,776
He was chasing after

1004
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:57,808
I reported to the police that way

1005
01:09:58,104 --> 01:10:01,847
Ok,Watch out for newspaper reporters

1006
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,159
2 million yen is just like a retirement allowance

1007
01:10:06,184 --> 01:10:08,409
What about the funeral?

1008
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:11,261
Anyway, go as an incumbent manager

1009
01:10:12,112 --> 01:10:15,487
Use the company's money to pay for his funeral.
It looks good

1010
01:10:20,292 --> 01:10:23,456
Hey,Please bring some snacks

1011
01:10:23,972 --> 01:10:26,003
Is there anything you can eat?

1012
01:10:26,425 --> 01:10:28,136
Look inside the fridge

1013
01:10:36,159 --> 01:10:38,378
There is only milk and orange in the fridge

1014
01:10:38,612 --> 01:10:39,792
Oh I see

1015
01:10:42,370 --> 01:10:44,862
I don't know about people who drinks

1016
01:10:48,261 --> 01:10:50,198
You should buy anything for me

1017
01:10:51,909 --> 01:10:53,464
What would you like?

1018
01:10:53,933 --> 01:10:57,112
It's common foods

1019
01:10:58,737 --> 01:11:00,362
What do you do outside every day?

1020
01:11:02,448 --> 01:11:04,120
I'm learning driving now

1021
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:05,769
It's interesting

1022
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:10,448
Can you buy a car for me if I got the car license?

1023
01:11:10,769 --> 01:11:12,386
There is a garage near here

1024
01:11:12,558 --> 01:11:13,917
What do you do when I buy a car?

1025
01:11:13,942 --> 01:11:14,995
I can go to play golf

1026
01:11:15,214 --> 01:11:17,745
Sometimes I also drive with you

1027
01:11:17,886 --> 01:11:19,487
Are you sure there is no snack?

1028
01:11:20,456 --> 01:11:21,847
We have chocolate.

1029
01:11:23,284 --> 01:11:24,878
You are bad girl

1030
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:48,081
Can I see Yokota-kun?

1031
01:11:48,526 --> 01:11:50,589
Yes, can I ask who are you?

1032
01:11:51,112 --> 01:11:52,878
I'm Katayama, can you call him?

1033
01:11:53,050 --> 01:11:55,690
Are you his school friend?

1034
01:11:55,948 --> 01:11:56,690
Yes I am

1035
01:11:57,081 --> 01:11:59,480
Please wait a min, I will ask him

1036
01:12:00,745 --> 01:12:02,659
Heijiro! Heijiro!

1037
01:12:02,684 --> 01:12:05,159
Yes...Um

1038
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,206
What's wrong?

1039
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:08,112
I'm here to play with you

1040
01:12:09,167 --> 01:12:10,058
Anyway come in

1041
01:12:14,151 --> 01:12:14,909
Excuse me

1042
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:29,972
Bring me a tobacco

1043
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:30,800
Yes

1044
01:12:31,456 --> 01:12:33,495
Your house is the same as my house

1045
01:12:33,769 --> 01:12:35,355
I see, he likes this

1046
01:12:36,034 --> 01:12:36,870
Take your seat

1047
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:40,058
Serve us tea

1048
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:40,706
Yes

1049
01:12:45,831 --> 01:12:47,526
You smoke nice tobacco

1050
01:12:48,269 --> 01:12:50,370
I smoke by Arima's money

1051
01:12:53,464 --> 01:12:56,339
What do you think of Katsuhei Arima?

1052
01:12:57,565 --> 01:13:02,917
Does he have to be the same as you think he is as I think he is?

1053
01:13:04,401 --> 01:13:09,480
I and you are brother-in-law, but you don't have to worry about our father

1054
01:13:09,917 --> 01:13:12,276
It ’s okay because our mother is different

1055
01:13:13,339 --> 01:13:15,425
She is my mother

1056
01:13:16,245 --> 01:13:20,003
Her name is Kaneko Yokota.
In short she is his mistress

1057
01:13:20,972 --> 01:13:24,761
She is not ashamed that she is his mistress

1058
01:13:25,808 --> 01:13:27,714
I look down on her

1059
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:31,722
It can't help that I'm her child

1060
01:13:32,558 --> 01:13:33,730
Take your time

1061
01:13:38,933 --> 01:13:42,808
It ’s not good to blame your mother.
You should blame your father.

1062
01:13:43,792 --> 01:13:46,026
I looked up Arima's business yesterday

1063
01:13:47,003 --> 01:13:48,901
There are two suicides this year

1064
01:13:49,839 --> 01:13:51,292
But His business is growing

1065
01:13:52,605 --> 01:13:53,862
In short, he is bad person

1066
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:59,245
He's a bad guy. He can do big business.
Good guys can't do.

1067
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:04,495
Big business is done by bad people for their own benefit.

1068
01:14:05,003 --> 01:14:06,933
He doesn't care about the suicides

1069
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:11,339
Do you approve of his methods?

1070
01:14:11,901 --> 01:14:12,378
Yes

1071
01:14:13,253 --> 01:14:15,081
I'm not humanist

1072
01:14:16,105 --> 01:14:18,855
The world today is not a place for old-fashioned thinking.

1073
01:14:19,433 --> 01:14:23,675
So do you approve he has 3 mistresses?

1074
01:14:24,839 --> 01:14:26,308
I hear now he has 4 mistresses

1075
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:29,558
I hear she has husband

1076
01:14:31,151 --> 01:14:34,675
He gives money and let him to study in France, and get her

1077
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:39,784
He thinks she will be happy

1078
01:14:42,675 --> 01:14:44,730
Even if his mistress is happy, her son is not happy

1079
01:14:46,026 --> 01:14:46,948
Women are stupid

1080
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,253
My mother is also a fool Your mother is also a fool

1081
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:54,706
I'm going to get rid of my father when I get a job

1082
01:14:55,487 --> 01:14:58,120
So I told her to separate with him later

1083
01:14:58,620 --> 01:14:59,987
What did your mother say?

1084
01:15:01,019 --> 01:15:02,253
She can't separate with him

1085
01:15:03,323 --> 01:15:04,409
I was surprised

1086
01:15:06,315 --> 01:15:08,526
I will join my father's company when I graduate

1087
01:15:09,362 --> 01:15:13,714
Arima's son holds an executive position at Arima's company

1088
01:15:14,909 --> 01:15:16,862
Even a mistress's child is a son

1089
01:15:17,206 --> 01:15:19,964
I'll make up for my life there

1090
01:15:20,714 --> 01:15:23,096
What if he doesn't get you into the company?

1091
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:26,948
If so, I set fire to my father's company

1092
01:15:28,370 --> 01:15:31,690
Earlier you said you looked down on your mother

1093
01:15:32,526 --> 01:15:34,034
I love my mother

1094
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:36,878
I think my mother is also a victim

1095
01:15:37,362 --> 01:15:40,354
She knew I was a illegitimate child when I was born

1096
01:15:40,557 --> 01:15:44,346
He did nothing during her ten-month gestation

1097
01:15:44,604 --> 01:15:46,221
I can't forgive it

1098
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:50,089
What do you think about your mother?

1099
01:15:51,698 --> 01:15:52,909
I think it was last spring

1100
01:15:54,057 --> 01:15:55,854
I had a quarrel with my mother about it

1101
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:57,846
I choked my mother.

1102
01:15:59,136 --> 01:16:00,557
I really tried to kill her

1103
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:06,026
But my mother didn't resist anything at that time

1104
01:16:06,051 --> 01:16:07,261
So I couldn't kill her

1105
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:50,251
Let me play

1106
01:16:50,876 --> 01:16:51,399
Yes

1107
01:16:59,844 --> 01:17:01,477
Wow! nice shot

1108
01:17:02,391 --> 01:17:03,438
Try it

1109
01:17:08,102 --> 01:17:09,282
With your right elbow

1110
01:17:09,915 --> 01:17:11,743
Extend your left elbow softly

1111
01:17:11,891 --> 01:17:12,391
Yes

1112
01:17:15,196 --> 01:17:16,157
I did it!

1113
01:17:16,188 --> 01:17:17,063
nice shot

1114
01:17:17,657 --> 01:17:18,673
Try again

1115
01:17:18,868 --> 01:17:19,501
Yes

1116
01:17:23,563 --> 01:17:28,805
Residents of Koshiya-gun, Takeya-cho have been hoping for the opening of the railway for many years.

1117
01:17:28,830 --> 01:17:31,821
since we, Seihoku Electric Railway, applied for the route

1118
01:17:32,290 --> 01:17:35,813
Cooperation promotion is being deliberated in the local village council

1119
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:39,635
Our company acquired about 820,000 tsubo of land along the line

1120
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:43,276
We are seriously hoping for the completion of this business.

1121
01:17:43,682 --> 01:17:48,315
Please give us approval as soon as possible.

1122
01:17:48,799 --> 01:17:52,455
We investigated the land acquired by Seihoku Electric Railway

1123
01:17:52,862 --> 01:17:56,049
They are buying two parallel lands in one place

1124
01:17:56,291 --> 01:17:59,549
The two lands are more than 1 km apart

1125
01:17:59,798 --> 01:18:01,290
This is really weird.

1126
01:18:01,658 --> 01:18:06,815
In other words, Seihoku Electric Railway is acquiring land for other businesses, not for the train business.

1127
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:09,994
We have a variety of businesses

1128
01:18:10,190 --> 01:18:13,838
We run housing and entertainment facilities

1129
01:18:14,213 --> 01:18:19,635
More than that, the Kanto development company is not ready to open the train

1130
01:18:19,948 --> 01:18:23,213
They bought 500,000 tsubo of land along the same line

1131
01:18:23,604 --> 01:18:26,713
They have no intention of doing business

1132
01:18:27,158 --> 01:18:33,049
They are profiting from manipulating the price of land.

1133
01:18:33,729 --> 01:18:34,924
What do you think about this point?

1134
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:38,971
I've improved since you taught me golf

1135
01:18:39,729 --> 01:18:40,666
I'm glad

1136
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:43,823
You will improve your golf because you are honest

1137
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:46,588
You think so?
I want to play good soon

1138
01:18:49,119 --> 01:18:49,908
I have to go

1139
01:19:05,901 --> 01:19:08,448
Nakamura-san.
Is he working here?

1140
01:19:08,549 --> 01:19:10,151
He is a trainee called Arima

1141
01:19:10,176 --> 01:19:10,760
Arima-san?

1142
01:19:10,785 --> 01:19:13,698
Do you know the Seihoku Electric Railway's chairman called Katsuhei Arima?

1143
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:16,377
He is the son of him

1144
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,346
Oh I see

1145
01:19:18,893 --> 01:19:19,963
Why he is here?

1146
01:19:19,994 --> 01:19:22,987
They have plans to build a golf course along the line

1147
01:19:23,682 --> 01:19:26,221
So Arima has sent him to study about it

1148
01:19:29,393 --> 01:19:32,588
Promotional movement for Seihoku Electric Railway is taking place

1149
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:35,854
The promotion federation has also been formed

1150
01:19:36,408 --> 01:19:39,346
However, according to the results of our research

1151
01:19:39,815 --> 01:19:44,448
Seihoku Electric Railway acquired residents living along the railway line for money

1152
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:46,963
And made them start this promotion movement

1153
01:19:47,221 --> 01:19:49,401
They gave the prefectural assembly members 200,000 yen

1154
01:19:49,557 --> 01:19:51,088
They gave the mayor 50,000 yen

1155
01:19:51,330 --> 01:19:54,307
They also gave the town councilor 50,000 yen

1156
01:19:54,979 --> 01:19:58,893
Regarding that matter, land acquisition was very difficult

1157
01:19:59,143 --> 01:20:02,713
I persuaded the locals to buy it

1158
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,119
It's not corruption

1159
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,815
I want to ask you another things

1160
01:20:06,090 --> 01:20:10,765
Chairman Arima of Seihoku Electric
Railway meets with the chairman of the

1161
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:17,441
Japanese National Railways and Ministry of Transport bureaucratsonce in February and once in April at a restaurant.

1162
01:20:17,941 --> 01:20:21,480
I think this is an acquisition.
What do you think?

1163
01:20:21,543 --> 01:20:24,004
Well...There may have been such a fact

1164
01:20:24,496 --> 01:20:27,488
But it's just a round-table conference

1165
01:20:28,207 --> 01:20:33,308
I hear that Mr. Kazuki of Kanto Development holds such a meeting every month.

1166
01:20:33,941 --> 01:20:35,214
Isn't it true?

1167
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:39,426
I heard they meet at a restaurant called Harutake in Akasaka

1168
01:20:45,113 --> 01:20:47,090
You look around a lot of golf courses,right?

1169
01:20:47,918 --> 01:20:49,316
I don't go much now

1170
01:20:49,754 --> 01:20:52,629
I used to go around golf clubs in the Kanto region.

1171
01:20:53,035 --> 01:20:54,090
Which is the best?

1172
01:20:54,972 --> 01:20:58,457
Well.. I like Sakuragaoka golf club most

1173
01:20:58,715 --> 01:21:00,504
Can you bring me there when you are free?

1174
01:21:00,629 --> 01:21:02,043
Yes sure

1175
01:21:03,105 --> 01:21:06,105
I want to go far like Atami and Ito

1176
01:21:06,465 --> 01:21:08,652
You don't have to take care of your house?

1177
01:21:09,394 --> 01:21:11,043
I am Mitsuko Fukumura

1178
01:21:11,277 --> 01:21:12,418
I am Akihiko Arima

1179
01:21:13,746 --> 01:21:15,457
I'm free

1180
01:21:16,816 --> 01:21:17,558
Do you have husband?

1181
01:21:18,621 --> 01:21:20,340
I'm alone

1182
01:21:21,379 --> 01:21:24,121
In areas where there are no plans to build a train

1183
01:21:24,394 --> 01:21:27,926
They were advertising that the train would pass there

1184
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:30,808
In addition, they were promoting malicious lies

1185
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:33,621
So the people of the area,they fought to buy and fight for the land.

1186
01:21:34,012 --> 01:21:38,363
They plan to sell the land waiting for the land price to soar

1187
01:21:38,707 --> 01:21:41,316
They are planning to make huge profits with it

1188
01:21:41,894 --> 01:21:46,402
Do you think this is a legitimate business for Seihoku Electric Railway?

1189
01:21:47,113 --> 01:21:48,887
To be honest

1190
01:21:49,628 --> 01:21:54,683
The area for which Seihoku Electric Railway is applying for approval is between the town of Rose and Koshibara.

1191
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:59,394
It will be extended to Oyamada-cho, another 8 km away.

1192
01:21:59,824 --> 01:22:02,410
This is scheduled for the second phase of construction

1193
01:22:02,644 --> 01:22:05,926
This has also been applied for approval by the Ministry of Transport

1194
01:22:06,488 --> 01:22:09,230
This is the fake information from the inside of Seihoku Electric Railway

1195
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,355
Don't bullshit!

1196
01:22:14,005 --> 01:22:18,779
As you know,Tsuchida of Kanto Development said something strange at the principals' meeting yesterday

1197
01:22:18,964 --> 01:22:23,522
In short,he said we're just waiting for land prices to skyrocket through our hoax,right?

1198
01:22:23,832 --> 01:22:25,957
If true, that's important

1199
01:22:26,293 --> 01:22:27,801
It's Involved in my honor

1200
01:22:28,418 --> 01:22:31,566
I think some real estate agent planned it

1201
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:34,324
We have to deal with it properly

1202
01:22:35,137 --> 01:22:39,629
If it was a real estate agent, let's catch the culprit and have them run an apology ad.

1203
01:22:40,597 --> 01:22:40,988
I get it

1204
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:44,285
So...

1205
01:22:45,379 --> 01:22:49,676
It's not a big deal so you should investigate it

1206
01:22:49,808 --> 01:22:52,722
It may take a few days, so please go to the site

1207
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:54,480
Yes, I understand

1208
01:22:59,316 --> 01:23:01,543
Hey, come here

1209
01:23:06,246 --> 01:23:08,543
You don't want a child?

1210
01:23:08,597 --> 01:23:09,683
I don't want

1211
01:23:10,379 --> 01:23:13,246
I promise to break up with you after 3 years

1212
01:23:13,652 --> 01:23:15,129
What if I had a child?

1213
01:23:15,426 --> 01:23:18,176
I will pay you child support.
And I can share my assets with you

1214
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:21,902
You and your child will never have a problem in life

1215
01:23:22,972 --> 01:23:24,847
That's not fair

1216
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:30,019
You're going to keep me forever,right?

1217
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:31,043
You don't want?

1218
01:23:31,832 --> 01:23:32,488
I don't want

1219
01:23:38,863 --> 01:23:39,879
Hello?

1220
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:42,097
From Mr.Iwabuchi

1221
01:23:44,621 --> 01:23:45,246
Hello?

1222
01:23:45,816 --> 01:23:47,472
About the case...

1223
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:51,426
As far as I research,I got an unexpected result

1224
01:23:52,058 --> 01:23:52,887
I'm in trouble

1225
01:23:53,238 --> 01:23:55,980
You don't have to be in trouble.
Tell me

1226
01:23:56,410 --> 01:23:59,918
Actually I contacted those real estate agents

1227
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:05,168
But They all said that Seihoku Electric Railway is starting to buy up

1228
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,090
They told me to go to the registry office

1229
01:24:07,730 --> 01:24:09,793
Then I went there

1230
01:24:10,105 --> 01:24:10,754
There are?

1231
01:24:11,113 --> 01:24:11,777
Yes

1232
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:13,676
Who is the name?

1233
01:24:13,847 --> 01:24:15,988
Although it is not officially registered

1234
01:24:16,887 --> 01:24:18,535
It's 7500 tsubo

1235
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:22,496
The name is Masanori Arima

1236
01:24:22,894 --> 01:24:23,613
Masanori?

1237
01:24:24,058 --> 01:24:25,090
In the name of my grandson

1238
01:24:26,363 --> 01:24:26,918
Um

1239
01:24:27,754 --> 01:24:29,355
So Kazuo has bought the land

1240
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:36,910
He has come here

1241
01:24:37,551 --> 01:24:38,379
Hello

1242
01:24:39,090 --> 01:24:40,480
It's getting warmer

1243
01:24:41,285 --> 01:24:42,214
What can I do for you?

1244
01:24:44,215 --> 01:24:45,215
Will you treat me a meal?

1245
01:24:46,801 --> 01:24:48,926
What is a consultation with me?

1246
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:52,847
You within the last 2 months

1247
01:24:53,144 --> 01:24:55,105
Between Koshibara and Koyamada-city

1248
01:24:55,832 --> 01:25:00,168
You have bought 7500 tsubo land by your child name

1249
01:25:01,113 --> 01:25:02,972
I know it's registered

1250
01:25:03,301 --> 01:25:05,004
I know how much you paid the contract

1251
01:25:05,621 --> 01:25:06,457
Is it true?

1252
01:25:10,933 --> 01:25:11,418
Yes

1253
01:25:12,426 --> 01:25:16,121
No matter how much land you buy, it doesn't matter to me

1254
01:25:18,152 --> 01:25:24,558
Are you the one who spread the rumor
that the Northwest Electric Railway will

1255
01:25:24,582 --> 01:25:28,336
extend its line to Oyamada and made
a plan to increase the price of land?

1256
01:25:29,438 --> 01:25:30,344
I want to ask you about it

1257
01:25:36,461 --> 01:25:38,563
I didn't know it was you.

1258
01:25:41,156 --> 01:25:42,188
I wanted money

1259
01:25:43,375 --> 01:25:44,078
I'm sorry

1260
01:25:45,211 --> 01:25:47,141
You are not poor

1261
01:25:47,672 --> 01:25:47,938
Right

1262
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,055
I'm not poor

1263
01:25:51,852 --> 01:25:55,860
But All the property of my house is yours

1264
01:25:57,039 --> 01:25:57,938
and my wife's

1265
01:25:59,945 --> 01:26:01,758
It's not an asset I have at my disposal.

1266
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,977
I studied literature

1267
01:26:06,508 --> 01:26:08,367
I want to study German literature

1268
01:26:09,610 --> 01:26:12,922
To be honest I don't want to work with you

1269
01:26:14,625 --> 01:26:17,524
I want to make money on my own

1270
01:26:18,297 --> 01:26:23,914
I want to make you, my brother, and my wife proud.

1271
01:26:25,164 --> 01:26:29,719
I don't mind being poor, I just want to go somewhere far away

1272
01:26:31,211 --> 01:26:33,227
with my family

1273
01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:37,492
I know how you feel but

1274
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,774
Did you think of my position?

1275
01:26:41,047 --> 01:26:43,531
We had no plans to build a train, but you lied to them.

1276
01:26:44,047 --> 01:26:46,289
That is, if it came from the Arima clan.

1277
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:51,625
I'll be the one in charge of that.

1278
01:26:53,227 --> 01:26:54,797
We have to apologize to the world

1279
01:26:55,930 --> 01:26:57,477
As you wish

1280
01:26:58,078 --> 01:27:01,102
Let's break our ties today

1281
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:13,937
There are two ways to decide where to locate the station.

1282
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:18,586
One is to build a station in a place where there are many people living.

1283
01:27:18,906 --> 01:27:20,711
There are many passengers

1284
01:27:21,031 --> 01:27:25,867
But it costs a lot of money to acquire land for the station.

1285
01:27:26,398 --> 01:27:30,242
I don't build a station where there is already a town

1286
01:27:31,156 --> 01:27:34,164
I build a new city around a new station

1287
01:27:35,258 --> 01:27:38,476
Acquire about 50,000 tsubo at the place to build a new station

1288
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:39,984
Build a new station in it

1289
01:27:40,437 --> 01:27:42,734
And there will be a shopping street around the station

1290
01:27:43,148 --> 01:27:44,648
Land prices will gradually increase

1291
01:27:46,687 --> 01:27:51,656
Even if we build a station in the grassland, it will become a town in 5 or 6 years.

1292
01:27:52,969 --> 01:27:53,648
Does it make sense?

1293
01:27:54,836 --> 01:27:56,453
This is my opinion

1294
01:27:57,070 --> 01:27:58,711
Do you have any other opinions?

1295
01:27:59,070 --> 01:28:04,125
I think people along the line will oppose us

1296
01:28:04,469 --> 01:28:05,516
What is the opposite?

1297
01:28:05,703 --> 01:28:08,703
It means that even if the train opens, it will not be convenient.

1298
01:28:09,359 --> 01:28:11,476
I think it's good for the development of the region

1299
01:28:11,664 --> 01:28:16,695
Then I think the people of the supporters are dissatisfied

1300
01:28:16,805 --> 01:28:18,328
It can't help

1301
01:28:18,672 --> 01:28:22,945
Train line development is also a public project

1302
01:28:23,297 --> 01:28:28,078
It's not something we do for the small benefit of their residents.

1303
01:28:28,273 --> 01:28:31,781
Regarding the acquisition of the railway land currently planned

1304
01:28:32,297 --> 01:28:34,414
6000 tsubo on the hill near the NOMI river

1305
01:28:34,609 --> 01:28:40,242
Kanto Kaihatsu has acquired about 16,000 tsubo of land between NOMI
 River and KASHIJIMA

1306
01:28:40,312 --> 01:28:43,320
They do not accept the acquisition of our railroad land

1307
01:28:43,905 --> 01:28:48,929
Kazuki said he'd take care of the registration process later after the sales contract.

1308
01:28:48,969 --> 01:28:51,922
That's why we couldn't find it in the registration search.

1309
01:28:52,805 --> 01:28:56,624
There are many other lands like this

1310
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:58,430
Change the planned location of the route

1311
01:28:58,812 --> 01:29:00,359
Divert them away from Kazuki's land.

1312
01:29:02,883 --> 01:29:04,828
Is their planned route area changed?

1313
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:10,070
Arima is strong but not a businessman

1314
01:29:10,250 --> 01:29:11,734
This is an amateur's idea

1315
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:15,312
We are not thinking about creating a new route from the beginning

1316
01:29:16,391 --> 01:29:19,351
Our land is getting more and more expensive because they are making noise

1317
01:29:19,961 --> 01:29:21,711
Thanks to Arima

1318
01:29:22,101 --> 01:29:25,344
We should keep the land.
Don't sell to the last minute

1319
01:29:25,820 --> 01:29:27,766
Let's wait for his action

1320
01:29:28,500 --> 01:29:30,789
Where are they going to build the station?

1321
01:29:31,101 --> 01:29:32,555
They don't build stations in town

1322
01:29:32,828 --> 01:29:34,719
They build a station 1 km away

1323
01:29:35,141 --> 01:29:36,773
Something will go wrong

1324
01:29:37,054 --> 01:29:41,507
Okozuki-kun,
Contact Yoshida on Tonejima and see what he can do.

1325
01:29:41,656 --> 01:29:42,266
Yes

1326
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:57,321
We have doubts about your way

1327
01:29:57,946 --> 01:29:58,602
Listen

1328
01:29:59,266 --> 01:30:02,188
You say that the train is a public works project. So sell the land.

1329
01:30:02,797 --> 01:30:04,790
So we sold the land cheaply

1330
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:06,243
But

1331
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:09,758
You bought up a million tsubo of land unrelated to the train

1332
01:30:10,227 --> 01:30:11,641
They are trying to raise the price of land

1333
01:30:11,898 --> 01:30:13,055
We are just farmer

1334
01:30:13,805 --> 01:30:15,758
We can't live without a field

1335
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,430
Every land is 2 to 3 times more expensive

1336
01:30:20,258 --> 01:30:21,930
Because you bought the land!

1337
01:30:21,955 --> 01:30:22,281
True!

1338
01:30:22,539 --> 01:30:25,664
I heard that the station will be built far away

1339
01:30:25,742 --> 01:30:27,188
Is that true?

1340
01:30:27,930 --> 01:30:32,867
If that's true, it's a scam using public utilities.

1341
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:36,758
In some cases, we will all sue Seihoku Electric Railway.

1342
01:30:37,906 --> 01:30:41,039
We understand.
We are investigating immediately

1343
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:44,609
We have negotiated sales with many people

1344
01:30:45,188 --> 01:30:49,297
So there may have been a misunderstanding or lack of explanation

1345
01:30:49,578 --> 01:30:52,078
We apologize for that.

1346
01:30:52,414 --> 01:30:53,555
Wait!

1347
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,242
Bring chairman!

1348
01:31:01,602 --> 01:31:04,141
Find out what kind of person they are

1349
01:31:05,008 --> 01:31:07,891
Find out what they are making noise for

1350
01:31:08,523 --> 01:31:11,445
Kazuki may be supporting them behind the scenes

1351
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:15,563
The chairman of that group is an innovator named Fujita.

1352
01:31:16,086 --> 01:31:18,578
In short, the price of land will rise steadily

1353
01:31:18,961 --> 01:31:21,680
He supported the farmers and local people

1354
01:31:21,875 --> 01:31:23,523
His plan is to consolidate the ground.

1355
01:31:23,664 --> 01:31:27,391
Is the Conservative Party still the main force in Matéki and Tone Island?

1356
01:31:27,516 --> 01:31:28,664
Yes mostly

1357
01:31:29,211 --> 01:31:32,117
That whole area is Conservative territory.

1358
01:31:32,335 --> 01:31:33,265
I see

1359
01:31:33,414 --> 01:31:35,117
Then let's leave it for a while

1360
01:31:35,422 --> 01:31:37,695
The problem will resolve itself over time

1361
01:31:37,945 --> 01:31:40,102
Are you talking to the police?

1362
01:31:40,352 --> 01:31:43,422
We are greeting for route approval

1363
01:31:43,680 --> 01:31:45,226
I think that would be fine

1364
01:31:46,094 --> 01:31:46,656
Hi

1365
01:31:47,188 --> 01:31:47,797
Chairman

1366
01:31:49,266 --> 01:31:51,453
This person wants to meet you

1367
01:31:52,703 --> 01:31:53,945
Koichi Makita?

1368
01:31:54,164 --> 01:31:57,375
He is a local representative and conservative on the new line

1369
01:31:58,266 --> 01:31:59,750
About the problem with the new route

1370
01:32:00,375 --> 01:32:01,938
As you may know

1371
01:32:02,414 --> 01:32:06,375
Residents along the line are dissatisfied

1372
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:09,898
If you leave it alone, public opinion will be very noisy.

1373
01:32:10,492 --> 01:32:12,453
It's not good for your business either.

1374
01:32:12,945 --> 01:32:16,297
Fujita, a convinced town councilor, is a problem

1375
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:19,844
He is a very good politician

1376
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:23,664
I just worry about this

1377
01:32:24,094 --> 01:32:26,313
I have a strong relationship with the locals

1378
01:32:26,531 --> 01:32:30,656
I'm going to do something about it while I still can.

1379
01:32:31,086 --> 01:32:34,133
So I came here today to hear your opinion

1380
01:32:36,227 --> 01:32:38,664
There are many types of protests

1381
01:32:39,375 --> 01:32:42,070
The opposition movement of the left wing system is the most dangerous

1382
01:32:42,672 --> 01:32:44,781
They have an ideological foundation

1383
01:32:45,336 --> 01:32:48,930
They're campaigning against something they believe in.

1384
01:32:49,844 --> 01:32:52,070
In this case it is difficult to buy up

1385
01:32:52,195 --> 01:32:54,430
It will be difficult if an investigation comes in from the police

1386
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,672
I think you don't have to worry about that

1387
01:33:00,141 --> 01:33:04,766
Conservatives are town councilors and leaders

1388
01:33:05,438 --> 01:33:07,297
They are under your control

1389
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:14,617
It's rude to say but They act according to their interests.

1390
01:33:15,125 --> 01:33:17,406
So it's easy to buy

1391
01:33:17,445 --> 01:33:18,367
It's wrong

1392
01:33:18,438 --> 01:33:20,523
Never mind

1393
01:33:21,094 --> 01:33:21,898
Anyway

1394
01:33:22,508 --> 01:33:26,414
You are the best leader in that area

1395
01:33:27,453 --> 01:33:33,117
Therefore, I would like to continue to use your help

1396
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,202
Nice on

1397
01:34:24,658 --> 01:34:26,393
I get burned

1398
01:34:26,418 --> 01:34:28,908
Stop it, I don't like, stop it

1399
01:34:29,330 --> 01:34:30,002
Where is my pajama?

1400
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:31,182
In bedroom

1401
01:34:31,549 --> 01:34:32,135
Give it to me

1402
01:34:32,236 --> 01:34:33,650
I'm cooking now

1403
01:34:33,713 --> 01:34:35,314
Help yourself

1404
01:35:08,665 --> 01:35:10,540
What did you do today?

1405
01:35:11,634 --> 01:35:13,220
You might get bored

1406
01:35:13,345 --> 01:35:15,118
I'm not bored but busy

1407
01:35:15,243 --> 01:35:16,470
What did you do this morning?

1408
01:35:16,837 --> 01:35:18,360
I went to beauty salon

1409
01:35:18,845 --> 01:35:20,540
What did you eat for lunch?

1410
01:35:21,126 --> 01:35:22,392
Why you ask me?

1411
01:35:24,017 --> 01:35:26,899
I worry you are bored everyday

1412
01:35:27,540 --> 01:35:29,532
Never mind.
I enjoy my life

1413
01:35:29,774 --> 01:35:30,978
Where did you go in the afternoon

1414
01:35:31,431 --> 01:35:33,095
In the afternoon..today

1415
01:35:34,056 --> 01:35:35,165
Today is Wednesday, right?

1416
01:35:35,517 --> 01:35:36,251
Cooking school

1417
01:35:37,368 --> 01:35:38,407
You go there

1418
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,509
I'm good girl,right?

1419
01:35:40,329 --> 01:35:41,431
What time did you get home?

1420
01:35:41,938 --> 01:35:43,251
Around 4 pm

1421
01:35:43,587 --> 01:35:44,212
Why?

1422
01:35:45,079 --> 01:35:46,508
Someone visited here?

1423
01:35:49,774 --> 01:35:51,142
No one visited

1424
01:35:53,173 --> 01:35:54,196
A man

1425
01:35:55,462 --> 01:35:56,993
It's strange

1426
01:35:57,556 --> 01:35:59,540
I never see man visitor

1427
01:36:00,610 --> 01:36:04,337
He sat here and smoked with you

1428
01:36:05,188 --> 01:36:07,024
One cigarette has lipstick

1429
01:36:07,967 --> 01:36:09,700
Another cigarette doesn't have lipstick

1430
01:36:10,462 --> 01:36:11,728
This is a cigarette that a man smoked

1431
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:13,110
You are strange

1432
01:36:13,251 --> 01:36:14,579
Do you doubt me?

1433
01:36:14,696 --> 01:36:15,782
Speak honestly

1434
01:36:16,345 --> 01:36:16,876
Who?

1435
01:36:17,173 --> 01:36:18,399
Not a man

1436
01:36:20,157 --> 01:36:20,954
A woman

1437
01:36:21,157 --> 01:36:22,923
A woman came to sew clothes

1438
01:36:23,431 --> 01:36:26,001
Why her cigarette doesn't have lipstick?

1439
01:36:26,290 --> 01:36:27,204
I have no idea

1440
01:36:28,087 --> 01:36:30,220
She probably wore high-end lipstick

1441
01:36:30,876 --> 01:36:32,798
How long he stayed here?

1442
01:36:33,063 --> 01:36:35,056
You doubt me so much

1443
01:36:35,946 --> 01:36:37,282
About 30 mins

1444
01:36:37,353 --> 01:36:38,837
I see

1445
01:36:39,188 --> 01:36:40,915
I think you are lying

1446
01:36:41,399 --> 01:36:45,306
I don't think women who can work have time to smoke

1447
01:36:45,571 --> 01:36:49,665
There are about 10 cigarettes that the person smoked here

1448
01:36:50,118 --> 01:36:51,876
Did she smoke one cigarette every 3 minutes?

1449
01:36:53,837 --> 01:36:55,970
This person is definitely a man

1450
01:37:13,782 --> 01:37:15,001
Can I stop by here?

1451
01:37:15,556 --> 01:37:18,196
No? I'm sorry

1452
01:37:18,829 --> 01:37:19,978
Maybe next time

1453
01:37:23,024 --> 01:37:24,938
I don't want to put you in this room

1454
01:37:25,712 --> 01:37:27,345
My life is a secret

1455
01:37:28,704 --> 01:37:31,688
Find out my identity.
It's interesting

1456
01:37:32,306 --> 01:37:35,360
You can't understand my way of life

1457
01:37:42,767 --> 01:37:47,376
I couldn't keep up with my dad's thoughts and dropped out of life

1458
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:50,149
I was studying theater when I was a student

1459
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:54,399
I fell in love with an actress and was scolded by my father

1460
01:37:55,392 --> 01:37:59,587
I've been fine since I met you

1461
01:38:00,376 --> 01:38:03,149
Will you meet me everyday,Mitsuko?

1462
01:38:16,298 --> 01:38:17,610
What are you thinking?

1463
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:24,196
If I keep living like this, I'm going to get worse and worse.

1464
01:38:25,071 --> 01:38:26,634
What's wrong with you?

1465
01:38:26,954 --> 01:38:28,595
I don't know what I'm doing.

1466
01:38:29,368 --> 01:38:30,821
I don't know what I'm living for.

1467
01:38:30,915 --> 01:38:33,141
You just have to do what you like

1468
01:38:33,166 --> 01:38:34,321
I don't mean that

1469
01:38:35,782 --> 01:38:37,524
I'm wrong as expected

1470
01:38:38,728 --> 01:38:41,626
So Shall I bring Sakai back from Paris?

1471
01:38:41,970 --> 01:38:43,962
I don't want to see him anymore

1472
01:38:46,938 --> 01:38:49,118
So, that man

1473
01:38:51,282 --> 01:38:53,509
You don't fool a man too much.

1474
01:38:54,181 --> 01:38:57,860
You are too attractive for men

1475
01:38:59,118 --> 01:39:00,618
I need nothing

1476
01:39:01,446 --> 01:39:02,665
Can you separate with me?

1477
01:39:03,196 --> 01:39:04,188
Separate?

1478
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:08,009
That man knows me?

1479
01:39:14,392 --> 01:39:16,251
He must be foolish

1480
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:50,235
Oh here

1481
01:39:51,282 --> 01:39:52,399
I don't want to go

1482
01:39:52,853 --> 01:39:53,759
You can go alone

1483
01:39:53,938 --> 01:39:55,509
Let's go together

1484
01:39:55,853 --> 01:39:57,618
You have the same problem as me

1485
01:39:58,220 --> 01:39:59,712
My father told me to come here

1486
01:40:00,321 --> 01:40:01,634
He will treat me a meal

1487
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:04,353
Why you afraid?

1488
01:40:06,587 --> 01:40:07,493
Hello?

1489
01:40:07,837 --> 01:40:09,368
One more customer

1490
01:40:09,782 --> 01:40:11,040
More dishes, please.

1491
01:40:11,181 --> 01:40:12,407
Certainly

1492
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,196
When do you guys graduate?

1493
01:40:17,415 --> 01:40:18,298
The year after next.

1494
01:40:18,938 --> 01:40:20,618
I came to talk to you about that

1495
01:40:20,643 --> 01:40:21,337
I see

1496
01:40:21,524 --> 01:40:23,063
Can I work at your company?

1497
01:40:23,282 --> 01:40:26,009
I have a lot of companies.
Which one?

1498
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,962
Your main business is the train business,right?

1499
01:40:29,751 --> 01:40:30,845
I want to work for the train company

1500
01:40:30,892 --> 01:40:33,063
Then take the entrance exam

1501
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,860
I need to take entrance exam?

1502
01:40:35,103 --> 01:40:38,165
Of course.
Everyone take the entrance exam.

1503
01:40:38,681 --> 01:40:39,485
That's strange

1504
01:40:40,478 --> 01:40:42,532
Did Ryutaro Arima take the exam?

1505
01:40:43,938 --> 01:40:45,321
He didn't

1506
01:40:45,673 --> 01:40:46,181
Why?

1507
01:40:46,462 --> 01:40:48,329
He's my successor.

1508
01:40:48,563 --> 01:40:51,517
But Son-in-law Sokichi took the exam

1509
01:40:51,806 --> 01:40:54,376
He became a son-in-law after joining the company

1510
01:40:55,103 --> 01:40:59,251
It's more profitable to have a son-in-law than to have a daughter-in-law.

1511
01:41:00,423 --> 01:41:02,204
We are your son

1512
01:41:02,579 --> 01:41:06,970
You made Ryutaro the president.
We also want to be an executive

1513
01:41:07,829 --> 01:41:09,454
We are all your son

1514
01:41:09,665 --> 01:41:10,720
There is a distinction

1515
01:41:11,329 --> 01:41:12,767
Do you mean your wife and mistress?

1516
01:41:13,485 --> 01:41:14,657
It might be so

1517
01:41:14,970 --> 01:41:17,282
We are the child you gave birth to

1518
01:41:20,251 --> 01:41:21,579
You are logical

1519
01:41:22,915 --> 01:41:24,212
Do you agree with him,Takeo?

1520
01:41:25,243 --> 01:41:27,532
In principle I agree with his opinion

1521
01:41:28,212 --> 01:41:30,392
But I don't expect anything from you

1522
01:41:30,978 --> 01:41:33,860
To be honest I don't want to see you

1523
01:41:34,798 --> 01:41:38,204
After graduating from college, I will part with my mother and live alone

1524
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:41,829
He is trying to escape reality

1525
01:41:42,587 --> 01:41:44,360
I think it's defeatism

1526
01:41:44,884 --> 01:41:46,196
I want to use you

1527
01:41:46,821 --> 01:41:50,235
I want to take advantage of your social status and wealth

1528
01:41:50,923 --> 01:41:53,188
You have a duty to help us

1529
01:41:53,540 --> 01:41:57,009
A corporation is a business entity

1530
01:41:57,649 --> 01:42:04,087
We will cooperate and manage for the development of business

1531
01:42:05,063 --> 01:42:07,782
Your way of thinking is fundamentally wrong

1532
01:42:08,970 --> 01:42:13,868
You are thinking of using the company for your own benefit

1533
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:18,688
We don't need such a person in the company

1534
01:42:19,274 --> 01:42:23,798
I'm explaining to you as the person in charge of the company, not your father

1535
01:42:25,103 --> 01:42:26,970
So you won't let me join your company

1536
01:42:27,188 --> 01:42:27,860
Right

1537
01:42:30,235 --> 01:42:35,142
So,Please recognize as your child because it will be a problem when I join another company

1538
01:42:36,337 --> 01:42:38,665
People who are ambiguous about their fathers don't get into good companies.

1539
01:42:39,079 --> 01:42:40,133
I disagree with it

1540
01:42:40,438 --> 01:42:44,438
Do you know what it means legally to recognize a child?

1541
01:42:44,868 --> 01:42:45,727
I know

1542
01:42:45,993 --> 01:42:47,657
I read and memorized the entire Six Laws.

1543
01:42:48,540 --> 01:42:50,532
There are problems with the Family Register Act and the Inheritance Act

1544
01:42:51,329 --> 01:42:55,391
Under the Family Register Act, if you acknowledge, I've been your child since I was born

1545
01:42:56,376 --> 01:42:59,907
Under inheritance law, I'll get billions after you die.

1546
01:43:00,915 --> 01:43:04,141
I am Shoko's child so I get half of them

1547
01:43:05,219 --> 01:43:07,766
I will probably get 300 million yen or 500 million yen

1548
01:43:09,329 --> 01:43:10,118
I see

1549
01:43:11,712 --> 01:43:13,829
You want my legacy

1550
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:17,454
You're black-heart-ed.

1551
01:43:18,352 --> 01:43:19,016
Go home

1552
01:44:11,202 --> 01:44:15,929
Tonejima-cho stop position change request meeting

1553
01:44:16,625 --> 01:44:22,804
Seihoku Electric Railway is a for-profit business, not a public project

1554
01:44:23,914 --> 01:44:27,766
We have cooperated with the construction of a new line for Seihoku Electric Railway

1555
01:44:28,656 --> 01:44:33,539
Because We thought that transportation would be convenient and that it would be beneficial to our lives.

1556
01:44:33,625 --> 01:44:35,281
That's right

1557
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:42,406
But Seihoku Electric Railway ignored our request

1558
01:44:42,797 --> 01:44:46,274
They say they will build a station 1 km away from the city

1559
01:44:50,813 --> 01:44:57,196
1.Pay cooperation money to farmers whose land has been forcibly expropriated.

1560
01:44:58,485 --> 01:45:07,304
2.Land not used for railroads should be returned to its original owners.

1561
01:45:08,539 --> 01:45:15,430
3.Build the station in the center of the station as the local people want.

1562
01:45:15,836 --> 01:45:17,039
That's right

1563
01:45:19,649 --> 01:45:23,680
I'm working 30 years into the future.

1564
01:45:24,086 --> 01:45:28,352
The Protesters aren't thinking about the future

1565
01:45:29,274 --> 01:45:35,625
Those people should be forcibly bribed or something.

1566
01:45:37,274 --> 01:45:40,586
The people are all selfish

1567
01:45:41,094 --> 01:45:42,813
Their opposition does not last long

1568
01:45:43,086 --> 01:45:45,672
I think their opposition will last a couple of months at most.

1569
01:45:46,110 --> 01:45:51,938
Even if the train station is built far, they will be happy to go to take the train.

1570
01:45:54,711 --> 01:45:58,594
A lot of people who are planning to oppose the new route are coming to the company right now.

1571
01:45:59,024 --> 01:46:00,985
They are protesting and ask us to meet you

1572
01:46:17,703 --> 01:46:19,024
Makita is not here?

1573
01:46:19,406 --> 01:46:20,641
Makita deputy?

1574
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:22,578
He is not here

1575
01:46:23,922 --> 01:46:25,789
He is no use

1576
01:46:26,140 --> 01:46:27,296
What shall we do?

1577
01:46:32,649 --> 01:46:34,860
Hello? wait a min

1578
01:46:35,367 --> 01:46:37,703
Phone call from Makita deputy

1579
01:46:38,758 --> 01:46:39,774
Hello? This is Arima speaking

1580
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:41,758
Hello? This is Makita speaking

1581
01:46:41,844 --> 01:46:44,649
I heard that the residents of Takeyama Town went to protest there.

1582
01:46:44,742 --> 01:46:46,641
Yes, It's very lively

1583
01:46:47,133 --> 01:46:49,461
Would you like to come here too?

1584
01:46:51,633 --> 01:46:54,039
I thought you would come

1585
01:46:54,414 --> 01:46:55,789
But I don't see you

1586
01:46:55,938 --> 01:46:57,688
I was wondering what happened to you

1587
01:46:59,047 --> 01:47:00,391
Then I'll be waiting for you

1588
01:47:01,727 --> 01:47:02,485
Kikukawa-kun

1589
01:47:02,735 --> 01:47:03,110
Yes

1590
01:47:03,469 --> 01:47:06,313
Only representatives of protests should enter the room.
Bring others to the roof

1591
01:47:06,617 --> 01:47:09,703
Tell them to wait a while while you review the request at the board meeting.

1592
01:47:12,044 --> 01:47:14,864
(Opposition movement song)

1593
01:47:22,926 --> 01:47:27,192
I've asked you to do this before, and this is the result.

1594
01:47:27,653 --> 01:47:30,020
So you didn't do anything

1595
01:47:31,856 --> 01:47:35,590
It can't be helped if you make an effort

1596
01:47:36,520 --> 01:47:39,067
You are not trusted from them at all

1597
01:47:39,879 --> 01:47:41,754
Or you don't have power

1598
01:47:42,668 --> 01:47:43,348
Tell me

1599
01:47:44,129 --> 01:47:46,231
Please tell me your opinion

1600
01:47:46,348 --> 01:47:47,535
Don't misunderstand

1601
01:47:47,785 --> 01:47:50,754
I've just been inconveniently busy.

1602
01:47:51,246 --> 01:47:54,871
I was careful but it didn't work

1603
01:47:55,653 --> 01:47:58,238
I was very busy in the Diet

1604
01:47:58,263 --> 01:47:59,559
Stop making excuses

1605
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:05,129
I'm building a train line, so it's important to have a relationship with that community.

1606
01:48:05,684 --> 01:48:08,973
So I have to have a relationship with the political leaders in the area

1607
01:48:09,293 --> 01:48:12,332
So I was going to work with you

1608
01:48:13,207 --> 01:48:18,043
If you don't cooperate with me I have to find another person

1609
01:48:18,762 --> 01:48:24,020
Then I will help another person instead of you in the next election

1610
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:29,489
I support that person and I think about our business development

1611
01:48:31,418 --> 01:48:32,801
I think like that

1612
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:34,707
Does it make sense?

1613
01:48:35,410 --> 01:48:36,848
Are you threatening me?

1614
01:48:38,465 --> 01:48:40,981
If it's to your detriment, it's blackmail.

1615
01:48:41,207 --> 01:48:44,824
It's not blackmail if it's in your best interest.

1616
01:48:48,137 --> 01:48:50,153
I don't mind either

1617
01:48:51,098 --> 01:48:53,692
Many people are coming to protest today

1618
01:48:53,973 --> 01:48:55,090
How do you control them?

1619
01:48:55,965 --> 01:49:00,309
If you do nothing I will do something

1620
01:49:00,334 --> 01:49:02,098
Wait, I will take care of it

1621
01:49:02,262 --> 01:49:04,121
They are my locals

1622
01:49:04,535 --> 01:49:06,403
If I talk them, it will be solved gracefully

1623
01:49:19,535 --> 01:49:21,403
Cheif, Our chairman is calling you

1624
01:49:22,012 --> 01:49:27,098
For example, when a station is built, a shop is needed in the waiting room.

1625
01:49:27,574 --> 01:49:31,582
Or We need more kiosks on train platforms to sell newspapers and cigarettes.

1626
01:49:32,137 --> 01:49:34,457
about running a concession stand

1627
01:49:34,746 --> 01:49:39,543
We recruit from residents along the railway line and give them business rights

1628
01:49:40,027 --> 01:49:41,770
We will announce like that

1629
01:49:41,795 --> 01:49:44,238
If I do this,Among the protesters

1630
01:49:44,410 --> 01:49:48,606
People who want to make money will apply for it.

1631
01:49:49,152 --> 01:49:52,152
Then those who are protesting will lose.

1632
01:49:53,863 --> 01:49:56,152
There are many small advantages like this

1633
01:49:56,606 --> 01:49:59,223
We're going to make things work like this.

1634
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:02,621
That's nice idea

1635
01:50:03,363 --> 01:50:05,973
You're very resourceful.

1636
01:50:06,824 --> 01:50:09,059
You should be a politician

1637
01:50:16,918 --> 01:50:18,410
Are you planning to build a school?

1638
01:50:18,566 --> 01:50:21,793
Yes,We're going to have a groundbreaking ceremony soon.

1639
01:50:22,285 --> 01:50:26,441
It is a science-based four-year vocational school named Seihoku Gakuen.

1640
01:50:27,426 --> 01:50:29,684
I will make it in the kosihara-city of Takihara

1641
01:50:30,535 --> 01:50:37,425
I would be grateful if you could take over as a director and get involved in school management.

1642
01:50:37,582 --> 01:50:38,925
I'm very grateful.

1643
01:50:38,950 --> 01:50:40,145
Good evening

1644
01:50:40,170 --> 01:50:40,894
Hi,Papa

1645
01:50:40,919 --> 01:50:41,902
Hi

1646
01:50:43,199 --> 01:50:45,113
It's been a while since you've been here.

1647
01:50:45,309 --> 01:50:47,207
You seem to live with a beautiful woman

1648
01:50:47,723 --> 01:50:50,770
There's a rumor going around here.

1649
01:50:55,699 --> 01:50:57,176
I think I will marry

1650
01:50:57,660 --> 01:50:59,387
Did you find anyone nice?

1651
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:01,746
Yes kind of

1652
01:51:03,348 --> 01:51:05,332
I agree with you to get married

1653
01:51:06,207 --> 01:51:08,590
You look happy lately and I'm glad

1654
01:51:10,184 --> 01:51:11,395
How old is she?

1655
01:51:12,129 --> 01:51:13,160
I don't know well

1656
01:51:13,871 --> 01:51:15,066
She is not so young

1657
01:51:15,152 --> 01:51:16,121
Around the same age with me

1658
01:51:16,324 --> 01:51:17,809
She has never married before?

1659
01:51:18,691 --> 01:51:20,090
I think so

1660
01:51:20,441 --> 01:51:21,637
I don't know well

1661
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:24,223
You should check it carefully

1662
01:51:24,762 --> 01:51:26,191
Where did you meet her?

1663
01:51:26,465 --> 01:51:27,973
At golf club

1664
01:51:28,996 --> 01:51:32,090
You should know her background

1665
01:51:32,324 --> 01:51:33,449
I don't care about her background

1666
01:51:34,316 --> 01:51:36,543
I also had a time at a mental hospital

1667
01:51:45,777 --> 01:51:46,770
Good evening

1668
01:51:47,051 --> 01:51:49,106
I want to talk to you a little

1669
01:51:49,152 --> 01:51:50,973
I have a visitor now

1670
01:51:51,309 --> 01:51:51,793
Sorry

1671
01:51:52,426 --> 01:51:53,863
Then I'll wait for a whole outside

1672
01:51:53,888 --> 01:51:55,090
Can you come tomorrow?

1673
01:51:55,152 --> 01:51:56,145
Just little OK

1674
01:51:56,457 --> 01:51:58,004
I told my mother about you

1675
01:51:58,215 --> 01:51:58,816
About that

1676
01:51:59,043 --> 01:52:00,363
I'm inconvenient today

1677
01:52:01,582 --> 01:52:02,473
Anyone is here?

1678
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:03,910
I have a visitor now

1679
01:52:04,793 --> 01:52:05,660
Who is the visitor?

1680
01:52:06,262 --> 01:52:07,988
Please go home now

1681
01:52:08,926 --> 01:52:10,043
Akihiko-san

1682
01:52:20,551 --> 01:52:23,020
I can see what your father is doing here.

1683
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:25,426
You came here to break our marriage

1684
01:52:25,668 --> 01:52:28,043
But I'll say it clearly

1685
01:52:28,535 --> 01:52:29,691
I'm already 28 years old

1686
01:52:29,996 --> 01:52:31,684
I can decide my life on my own

1687
01:52:33,684 --> 01:52:37,465
I'm leaving home.
I'm not going to be your watch

1688
01:52:38,543 --> 01:52:41,832
I will do my best with her no matter how poor

1689
01:52:42,613 --> 01:52:43,856
So Please go home!

1690
01:52:49,785 --> 01:52:52,840
You seem to want to marry her.

1691
01:52:53,895 --> 01:52:55,176
But You can't

1692
01:52:55,684 --> 01:52:57,082
There is a reason

1693
01:52:57,426 --> 01:52:59,121
There is no such a reason

1694
01:52:59,840 --> 01:53:02,770
Don't get involved with us anyway

1695
01:53:03,551 --> 01:53:04,332
Please go home!

1696
01:53:05,895 --> 01:53:07,512
You know nothing

1697
01:53:08,754 --> 01:53:10,270
She has a husband

1698
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:13,316
He is Sakai Yoshiharu, a painter

1699
01:53:13,746 --> 01:53:15,504
He is in Paris now

1700
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:24,129
Mitsuko-san

1701
01:53:25,160 --> 01:53:27,215
Is it true what he said?

1702
01:53:30,066 --> 01:53:31,238
Is it true ?

1703
01:53:32,652 --> 01:53:33,684
It's true

1704
01:53:36,848 --> 01:53:42,129
And I am your father's mistress

1705
01:53:47,535 --> 01:53:48,668
Dad

1706
01:53:49,926 --> 01:53:50,824
Is it true ?

1707
01:54:13,824 --> 01:54:16,504
Are you trying to take revenge on me?

1708
01:54:16,723 --> 01:54:18,332
No at all!

1709
01:54:20,598 --> 01:54:21,566
No!

1710
01:54:21,621 --> 01:54:23,121
No!No!

1711
01:54:30,895 --> 01:54:33,668
Akihiko tried to commit suicide

1712
01:54:33,762 --> 01:54:34,199
What?

1713
01:54:34,574 --> 01:54:36,059
He took a tablet

1714
01:54:36,520 --> 01:54:37,238
What he took?

1715
01:54:37,801 --> 01:54:39,215
He took sleeping pills

1716
01:54:40,222 --> 01:54:41,535
It's not a problem

1717
01:54:42,574 --> 01:54:43,582
Is he conscious?

1718
01:54:44,277 --> 01:54:45,816
He is still sleeping

1719
01:54:48,645 --> 01:54:52,106
He came back and stayed in the room.

1720
01:54:52,723 --> 01:54:54,715
I thought it was odd, so I peeked into the room.

1721
01:55:18,473 --> 01:55:19,801
He is stupid

1722
01:55:20,449 --> 01:55:22,473
Mom, let's go

1723
01:55:23,809 --> 01:55:25,285
What are you talking about?

1724
01:55:25,949 --> 01:55:26,449
 let's go

1725
01:55:42,527 --> 01:55:47,074
Then mom and mom have a special relationship.

1726
01:55:47,481 --> 01:55:48,277
Yes

1727
01:55:50,379 --> 01:55:53,238
Then I don't think there is a need to file a proceeding

1728
01:55:54,370 --> 01:55:59,714
If the father and mother discuss the issue and report the recognition.

1729
01:55:59,739 --> 01:56:00,988
That would be no problem

1730
01:56:01,013 --> 01:56:03,168
I have asked my father but he refused

1731
01:56:04,481 --> 01:56:07,715
Is it profitable for you to be recognized?

1732
01:56:07,863 --> 01:56:09,957
I have both mental and material benefits

1733
01:56:11,894 --> 01:56:13,574
What is your father name?

1734
01:56:13,699 --> 01:56:15,051
He is Katsuhei Arima

1735
01:56:16,582 --> 01:56:22,386
Katsuhei Arima.....Seihoku Electric Railway's Katsuhei Arima?

1736
01:56:23,035 --> 01:56:24,191
Yes

1737
01:56:24,972 --> 01:56:28,582
So you are his son?

1738
01:56:28,808 --> 01:56:29,261
Yes

1739
01:56:29,761 --> 01:56:31,519
I see

1740
01:56:33,777 --> 01:56:34,465
OK

1741
01:56:35,043 --> 01:56:37,910
We accept proceedings for recognition claims

1742
01:56:45,847 --> 01:56:46,886
Hello?

1743
01:56:47,183 --> 01:56:48,277
Hi, it's me

1744
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,457
Hi, what happened?

1745
01:56:51,176 --> 01:56:53,433
I haven't seen you in a while

1746
01:56:53,886 --> 01:56:55,433
Sorry. I've been busy

1747
01:56:55,980 --> 01:56:57,824
Are you coming to see me tonight?

1748
01:56:58,097 --> 01:56:59,324
No, I can't

1749
01:56:59,402 --> 01:57:00,660
That's too bad

1750
01:57:01,082 --> 01:57:03,902
I'm cooking your favorite natto now

1751
01:57:04,332 --> 01:57:05,332
Is Eijiro there?

1752
01:57:06,129 --> 01:57:07,715
He is still in the school

1753
01:57:08,089 --> 01:57:09,198
What can I do for you?

1754
01:57:09,511 --> 01:57:11,894
He sued me

1755
01:57:12,152 --> 01:57:13,269
It is a cognitive proceeding

1756
01:57:13,871 --> 01:57:14,472
Listen

1757
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:18,019
He needs to be legally recognized as my real son.

1758
01:57:18,465 --> 01:57:21,089
I don't know what it is

1759
01:57:21,114 --> 01:57:22,051
Never mind

1760
01:57:22,613 --> 01:57:25,136
He has disgraced my face.

1761
01:57:26,254 --> 01:57:28,074
He wants money

1762
01:57:28,371 --> 01:57:29,761
He's after my fortune.

1763
01:57:30,160 --> 01:57:32,277
I'm sorry

1764
01:57:32,558 --> 01:57:36,152
He will come back home soon, so Please come here

1765
01:57:37,176 --> 01:57:39,230
I don't want to see him

1766
01:57:39,980 --> 01:57:41,394
He is my son for sure

1767
01:57:41,949 --> 01:57:44,410
I will never forgive anyone who opposes me

1768
01:57:47,051 --> 01:57:50,097
My Father is ignorant.
I filed a proceeding

1769
01:57:50,426 --> 01:57:52,129
It's just an excuse

1770
01:57:53,136 --> 01:57:54,090
I understand his position

1771
01:57:54,863 --> 01:57:57,379
He think I'll lose if he complains to my mom

1772
01:57:58,121 --> 01:57:59,293
That's not fair

1773
01:58:00,058 --> 01:58:01,340
He is using bad means

1774
01:58:03,722 --> 01:58:05,957
I understand your thinking

1775
01:58:07,105 --> 01:58:09,574
the apple doesn't fall far from the tree

1776
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:12,340
He took good care of you

1777
01:58:12,543 --> 01:58:16,488
I'm not going to bother him

1778
01:58:16,988 --> 01:58:19,418
All I need is for him to recognize me.

1779
01:58:20,191 --> 01:58:25,168
If he cuts off with us we can't live

1780
01:58:27,066 --> 01:58:29,465
Please withdraw the proceedings

1781
01:58:31,246 --> 01:58:33,676
You were more than happy to be his mistress.

1782
01:58:34,402 --> 01:58:36,418
But I have no choice to be his son

1783
01:58:37,105 --> 01:58:41,019
I demand my legitimate rights

1784
01:58:46,035 --> 01:58:46,660
Mom

1785
01:58:47,496 --> 01:58:51,246
I've found a apartment near my school. I will live there from tomorrow

1786
01:58:52,074 --> 01:58:53,832
What will you do when you move into the apartment?

1787
01:58:54,652 --> 01:58:57,363
I want to study alone

1788
01:58:58,254 --> 01:59:00,051
I think it would be good for you too

1789
01:59:00,449 --> 01:59:01,402
Why?

1790
01:59:01,957 --> 01:59:03,316
Why do you think so?

1791
01:59:04,105 --> 01:59:06,824
I don't want to see my father's face

1792
01:59:09,035 --> 01:59:11,793
Dad is easier to get here if I'm not here

1793
01:59:47,957 --> 01:59:48,941
What's wrong, mom?

1794
01:59:48,996 --> 01:59:49,699
What's wrong?

1795
01:59:51,269 --> 01:59:53,519
You don't hate me anymore, do you?

1796
01:59:54,918 --> 01:59:56,379
You don't hate me anymore, do you?

1797
01:59:56,746 --> 01:59:58,113
What are you talking about?

1798
01:59:58,379 --> 02:00:00,051
I didn't say that

1799
02:00:00,707 --> 02:00:03,238
I thought you won't come here anymore

1800
02:00:04,558 --> 02:00:06,707
I thought you abandoned me

1801
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:09,308
I come back home every Sunday

1802
02:00:11,332 --> 02:00:15,168
I leave home because I love you, mom

1803
02:00:17,160 --> 02:00:18,238
Takeo

1804
02:00:20,316 --> 02:00:22,511
Let me sleep here tonight

1805
02:00:25,074 --> 02:00:27,207
Can you sleep besides you?

1806
02:00:34,457 --> 02:00:35,472
Chairman

1807
02:00:36,074 --> 02:00:38,027
Thank you for everything

1808
02:00:39,027 --> 02:00:41,308
I leave without seeing you

1809
02:00:42,215 --> 02:00:44,433
Please forgive my selfishness

1810
02:00:55,879 --> 02:00:57,801
It's not serious case

1811
02:00:58,145 --> 02:01:01,270
There is nothing wrong with his brain

1812
02:01:01,918 --> 02:01:02,574
Will he get better?

1813
02:01:02,824 --> 02:01:04,465
I think he will get better

1814
02:01:04,926 --> 02:01:09,692
If he has a strong personality, he won't get sick

1815
02:01:10,762 --> 02:01:14,754
He is a mentally weak person

1816
02:01:15,504 --> 02:01:18,981
He is in that greenhouse.
You should go there

1817
02:01:19,973 --> 02:01:21,113
It's ok if I talk with him?

1818
02:01:21,184 --> 02:01:22,137
No problem

1819
02:01:29,262 --> 02:01:29,738
Hi

1820
02:01:30,832 --> 02:01:31,809
You seem to be fine

1821
02:01:39,762 --> 02:01:41,379
I brought some fruits

1822
02:01:42,668 --> 02:01:45,192
Our mom was going to see you, but she got cold

1823
02:01:45,746 --> 02:01:48,012
She asked me to see you

1824
02:01:56,613 --> 02:01:58,199
Is he also mentally illness?

1825
02:01:59,621 --> 02:02:04,035
You can't tell who's mentally illness from the outside.

1826
02:02:05,887 --> 02:02:08,403
You think I'm the only one with a mental illness

1827
02:02:09,410 --> 02:02:12,012
You may also be mentally illness

1828
02:02:12,707 --> 02:02:14,403
Our father is completely mentally illness

1829
02:02:15,059 --> 02:02:17,535
He is strong and shameless

1830
02:02:18,926 --> 02:02:21,403
He doesn't care if others die or his subordinates die

1831
02:02:22,145 --> 02:02:24,707
And he makes mistress one after another

1832
02:02:26,262 --> 02:02:30,559
He's crazy because of the wealth he's saved

1833
02:02:37,059 --> 02:02:38,903
I read a newspaper

1834
02:02:39,653 --> 02:02:41,949
Father seems to build a school

1835
02:02:42,324 --> 02:02:44,184
Yes, today is the groundbreaking ceremony

1836
02:02:44,738 --> 02:02:47,520
He's working very hard.

1837
02:02:48,082 --> 02:02:49,785
So he is mentally illness

1838
02:02:52,621 --> 02:02:54,692
Will he educate the young men?

1839
02:02:55,043 --> 02:02:55,996
What kind of education does he do?

1840
02:02:57,113 --> 02:02:58,528
He can teach nothing

1841
02:03:00,981 --> 02:03:02,692
Brother, tell him

1842
02:03:03,481 --> 02:03:06,410
I am against your school

1843
02:03:07,637 --> 02:03:11,684
If my dad really builds a school, I will announce my dad's badness to the media

1844
02:03:12,418 --> 02:03:17,090
If it didn't work, I'm going to kill myself by jumping off the roof of his school.

1845
02:03:18,598 --> 02:03:19,817
 I'm going to kill myself!

1846
02:03:23,442 --> 02:03:25,418
Hey, don't be mad

1847
02:03:26,020 --> 02:03:28,293
Ok, so I will come to see you again

1848
02:03:32,129 --> 02:03:55,957
(Groundbreaking ceremony saying)

1849
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:17,059
Madam

1850
02:04:18,606 --> 02:04:19,973
I have a favor of you

1851
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:21,199
OK

1852
02:04:21,988 --> 02:04:25,020
Tamiko and kaneko

1853
02:04:25,824 --> 02:04:27,645
I will cut relationship with them

1854
02:04:27,903 --> 02:04:30,996
They have your children

1855
02:04:31,481 --> 02:04:34,176
Actually they are already old

1856
02:04:34,957 --> 02:04:37,645
You may get angry if I say it

1857
02:04:38,035 --> 02:04:40,942
Old mistresses are worthless.

1858
02:04:40,967 --> 02:04:42,059
You are too bad

1859
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:45,379
And the kids are already college students

1860
02:04:45,731 --> 02:04:49,613
I don't think they would be comfortable with me attending their home.

1861
02:04:50,004 --> 02:04:52,949
So they file cognitive proceedings and leave home

1862
02:04:53,801 --> 02:04:57,598
I think it's better to break the relationship with my mistress for the sake of the children

1863
02:04:58,324 --> 02:05:00,707
So you are asking me to tell them about it?

1864
02:05:00,895 --> 02:05:02,340
That's right

1865
02:05:02,723 --> 02:05:04,449
You're the only one I can ask.

1866
02:05:04,699 --> 02:05:06,098
So How much you owe them?

1867
02:05:06,613 --> 02:05:09,262
Well...How about 5 million yen?

1868
02:05:09,770 --> 02:05:11,363
That's a lot

1869
02:05:12,113 --> 02:05:14,176
I also wanted such a master

1870
02:05:14,512 --> 02:05:16,918
In our case, it was just 300000yen

1871
02:05:18,051 --> 02:05:18,707
So can you?

1872
02:05:19,973 --> 02:05:21,465
I have no choice

1873
02:05:22,223 --> 02:05:23,981
It's hard to tell them about it

1874
02:05:24,270 --> 02:05:26,488
I'm in trouble if she cries

1875
02:05:26,676 --> 02:05:28,801
I know how you feel.
I will pay you the reward

1876
02:05:36,348 --> 02:05:38,520
I will be free

1877
02:05:44,199 --> 02:05:46,309
By the way, Is Mitsuko fine?

1878
02:05:47,879 --> 02:05:49,340
I separated with her

1879
02:05:50,129 --> 02:05:51,629
Oh really?

1880
02:05:52,652 --> 02:05:53,684
She left home

1881
02:05:54,785 --> 02:05:55,942
She is missing now

1882
02:05:56,856 --> 02:06:00,699
Then you have no place to go home right now

1883
02:06:00,996 --> 02:06:02,371
That's why I'm here

1884
02:06:02,777 --> 02:06:04,371
I need to look for new mistress

1885
02:06:04,621 --> 02:06:05,567
Do you know anyone nice?

1886
02:06:05,801 --> 02:06:07,738
Is Geisha girl OK?

1887
02:06:08,809 --> 02:06:10,629
They are easy to pick

1888
02:06:10,879 --> 02:06:14,645
They can easily be mistresses with money

1889
02:06:14,988 --> 02:06:19,731
Do you take good care of your mistress?

1890
02:06:20,551 --> 02:06:24,707
His mistress seems to be a businesswoman now

1891
02:06:24,732 --> 02:06:25,270
Right

1892
02:06:25,793 --> 02:06:28,848
If they quit my job as a geisha, they'd be bored.

1893
02:06:29,277 --> 02:06:32,902
So in the daytime she goes golfing with her boyfriend

1894
02:06:33,059 --> 02:06:34,942
It ’s not so good to deal with geisha.

1895
02:06:34,987 --> 02:06:35,730
I see

1896
02:06:39,168 --> 02:06:40,067
Miyo-Chan

1897
02:06:40,777 --> 02:06:42,395
Can you call Komamo-san?

1898
02:06:42,692 --> 02:06:46,496
Tell her where she will go, and Ask her to come here

1899
02:07:22,387 --> 02:07:23,520
How old are you?

1900
02:07:24,277 --> 02:07:25,371
Are you already 60?

1901
02:07:26,317 --> 02:07:27,379
Or you are younger?

1902
02:07:28,043 --> 02:07:30,371
You don't have to care about my age

1903
02:07:30,551 --> 02:07:34,356
I'm not virgin

1904
02:07:35,285 --> 02:07:37,231
Yes I know

1905
02:07:37,363 --> 02:07:40,668
I will obey anything if you give me money

1906
02:07:40,981 --> 02:07:45,527
But I hate being called a mistress

1907
02:07:46,074 --> 02:07:47,348
I feel insulted when people say that to me.

1908
02:07:47,848 --> 02:07:52,520
So keep it secret that I'm your mistress

1909
02:07:53,551 --> 02:07:56,238
It's selfish, but please understand

1910
02:07:56,856 --> 02:08:01,270
Which means I'd like to pretend I'm only having an affair.

1911
02:08:04,324 --> 02:08:07,606
Don't spend the money in my room

1912
02:08:08,059 --> 02:08:09,356
I will save all money

1913
02:08:11,637 --> 02:08:14,965
When you dump me, you'll give me a handout?

1914
02:08:15,129 --> 02:08:15,988
About 1 million yen

1915
02:08:16,152 --> 02:08:17,848
Yes, sure

1916
02:08:18,043 --> 02:08:19,090
I'm glad

1917
02:08:21,598 --> 02:08:24,543
I will start a business with the money

1918
02:08:25,012 --> 02:08:28,582
I'm thinking of opening a beauty salon

1919
02:08:28,918 --> 02:08:30,824
Oh that's good

1920
02:08:37,043 --> 02:08:40,887
If I'm in love from now on, the other person will surely be a poor man

1921
02:08:41,652 --> 02:08:45,020
I hate marrying old people, no matter how rich they are

1922
02:08:45,567 --> 02:08:47,402
It's a waste of my youth.

1923
02:08:48,168 --> 02:08:51,473
After all,I want to marry a young person

1924
02:08:51,856 --> 02:08:52,801
Don't you think so?

1925
02:08:56,301 --> 02:08:58,207
This document does not have the father's name

1926
02:08:58,465 --> 02:08:59,543
No, there is no

1927
02:09:00,043 --> 02:09:01,301
Is there any reason?

1928
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:03,090
I am the son of a mistress.

1929
02:09:03,660 --> 02:09:04,293
I see

1930
02:09:05,004 --> 02:09:07,215
We don't use such words now

1931
02:09:07,668 --> 02:09:09,832
It is written in the Six Codes that I am a son

1932
02:09:10,488 --> 02:09:12,332
But Actually I am the son of a mistress.

1933
02:09:12,652 --> 02:09:14,152
Will your father acknowledge?

1934
02:09:14,574 --> 02:09:16,379
Now I'm suing it in the family court

1935
02:09:16,567 --> 02:09:18,590
What? Are you son of Arima?

1936
02:09:19,168 --> 02:09:19,942
What kind of person is he?

1937
02:09:20,035 --> 02:09:21,824
He is a solid and good young man

1938
02:09:21,856 --> 02:09:22,457
Is he spy?

1939
02:09:22,660 --> 02:09:24,934
But if he's a spy, he won't call himself

1940
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:26,442
Hmmm...ok

1941
02:09:26,965 --> 02:09:27,629
I will meet him

1942
02:09:27,762 --> 02:09:28,902
I will bring him

1943
02:09:30,457 --> 02:09:32,902
But why don't you join Seihoku Electric Railway?

1944
02:09:33,574 --> 02:09:36,652
You can join the company without taking the entrance exam

1945
02:09:36,965 --> 02:09:38,692
My father refused to join me

1946
02:09:40,027 --> 02:09:40,871
Can you come?

1947
02:09:44,543 --> 02:09:46,145
He is our chairman,Kazuki

1948
02:09:47,777 --> 02:09:48,973
Take your seat

1949
02:09:53,856 --> 02:09:57,582
Your dad and I are close

1950
02:09:58,465 --> 02:10:01,871
It's ironic that you want to get a job at my company

1951
02:10:02,442 --> 02:10:04,637
Do not misunderstand.
I am seriously hoping to join your company

1952
02:10:05,098 --> 02:10:06,294
That's ironic

1953
02:10:07,114 --> 02:10:09,817
Your dad is my competitor

1954
02:10:10,411 --> 02:10:11,739
He is great business man

1955
02:10:12,450 --> 02:10:14,755
The train will open soon

1956
02:10:15,114 --> 02:10:17,223
In addition he does an education business

1957
02:10:18,130 --> 02:10:22,255
I've heard rumors that he's getting a medal from the government.

1958
02:10:23,309 --> 02:10:29,137
I heard that you have filed a proceeding against Arima for a request for recognition.

1959
02:10:29,254 --> 02:10:30,137
Is that true?

1960
02:10:30,934 --> 02:10:31,926
That's true

1961
02:10:33,176 --> 02:10:34,770
Is it possible for you to win?

1962
02:10:35,825 --> 02:10:36,926
No at all

1963
02:10:37,286 --> 02:10:37,981
Why?

1964
02:10:38,755 --> 02:10:41,231
He's your father, so it's natural to recognize

1965
02:10:41,708 --> 02:10:42,934
I think so but

1966
02:10:43,481 --> 02:10:45,520
He refuses to legally acknowledge it.

1967
02:10:46,747 --> 02:10:47,926
That's not logical

1968
02:10:48,145 --> 02:10:50,309
If this goes to trial, you'll win.

1969
02:10:50,567 --> 02:10:51,325
I see

1970
02:10:52,005 --> 02:10:53,317
But I have no legal costs

1971
02:10:53,465 --> 02:10:54,778
Shall I support you?

1972
02:10:55,372 --> 02:10:57,106
I can help you

1973
02:10:58,325 --> 02:10:59,372
Thank you very much

1974
02:11:00,122 --> 02:11:04,465
But this is a matter of blood between parent and child.

1975
02:11:05,020 --> 02:11:07,559
I want to solve it with him

1976
02:11:09,161 --> 02:11:10,989
Do I Pass Your Company's Entrance Exam?

1977
02:11:13,606 --> 02:11:15,192
You will probably pass

1978
02:11:17,622 --> 02:11:18,419
Is Heijiro in?

1979
02:11:18,622 --> 02:11:20,989
Well...I'm alone today

1980
02:11:21,333 --> 02:11:23,801
He has gone to the mountain with his friends for a few days

1981
02:11:24,036 --> 02:11:27,075
He seems to have taken the entrance examination of Kazuki's company

1982
02:11:27,325 --> 02:11:32,317
I hear Mr.Kazuki met me during his interview.

1983
02:11:33,864 --> 02:11:35,872
He thoroughly opposes me

1984
02:11:36,833 --> 02:11:39,051
Hey Kaneko, Listen

1985
02:11:39,723 --> 02:11:42,989
I will not recognize him under any circumstances.

1986
02:11:43,153 --> 02:11:43,973
I am also stubborn

1987
02:11:44,973 --> 02:11:47,419
So you can tell him

1988
02:11:47,926 --> 02:11:49,301
Withdraw the proceedings

1989
02:11:49,825 --> 02:11:55,403
If you can't, I won't give you what I promised the other day

1990
02:11:55,551 --> 02:11:58,200
What do you mean by that?

1991
02:12:00,051 --> 02:12:02,669
You won't let him join your company

1992
02:12:04,083 --> 02:12:07,161
So it's free for him to join any company

1993
02:12:08,887 --> 02:12:11,997
I can't tell him to withdraw the proceeding

1994
02:12:13,559 --> 02:12:16,637
He is your son for sure

1995
02:12:17,098 --> 02:12:20,114
I...Listen

1996
02:12:20,458 --> 02:12:24,098
I won't give you money unless he withdraw the proceedings

1997
02:12:24,903 --> 02:12:25,653
Understand?

1998
02:12:25,762 --> 02:12:27,505
Yes I get it

1999
02:12:28,622 --> 02:12:30,544
I need nothing from you

2000
02:12:32,450 --> 02:12:36,590
You are too selfish. Please do whatever you want

2001
02:12:37,676 --> 02:12:39,911
He has his own thinking

2002
02:12:40,411 --> 02:12:42,630
I think he is doing right

2003
02:12:43,426 --> 02:12:44,489
Hey,Kaneko

2004
02:12:45,145 --> 02:12:46,692
when you have changed yourself?

2005
02:12:47,137 --> 02:12:51,989
I will now file a cognitive lawsuit in support of Heijiro.

2006
02:12:52,739 --> 02:12:55,411
Sell this land to make legal costs

2007
02:12:56,208 --> 02:12:58,575
This is my duty as his mother

2008
02:12:59,708 --> 02:13:04,153
This is the important thing that his life takes

2009
02:13:19,020 --> 02:13:22,450
The request of the opposition movement union is 5,000 yen every two months

2010
02:13:22,934 --> 02:13:25,630
The bus labor union is also 5,000 yen in two and a half months

2011
02:13:26,403 --> 02:13:27,965
Department store union is 2 months

2012
02:13:28,669 --> 02:13:30,590
Hotel labor union is one and a half months

2013
02:13:31,044 --> 02:13:34,098
They are requesting a reply by the day after tomorrow

2014
02:13:35,239 --> 02:13:37,083
The biggest problem is the train union

2015
02:13:37,567 --> 02:13:40,145
They will go on strike for a long time

2016
02:13:40,622 --> 02:13:44,809
Depending on our reply, they will go on strike soon

2017
02:13:46,215 --> 02:13:48,481
I have experienced a lot of strikes

2018
02:13:48,637 --> 02:13:50,294
I will know the result

2019
02:13:50,458 --> 02:13:54,419
I wouldn't be surprised if the train stopped for 4 or 5 days

2020
02:13:55,364 --> 02:13:57,989
But now is not a good time.

2021
02:13:58,231 --> 02:14:03,067
It's not a good idea to prolong the fuss and get involved in the opposition to the Takeyama Line.

2022
02:14:03,669 --> 02:14:06,200
I'm sure the union folks will think of that too.

2023
02:14:06,661 --> 02:14:09,778
Accept a little bit of their request

2024
02:14:11,208 --> 02:14:13,169
Instead, be tough on them next year.

2025
02:14:13,505 --> 02:14:18,278
Get ready now.
Let the noisy person get a job title

2026
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:21,184
Put them in positions such as chief or section chief.

2027
02:14:22,114 --> 02:14:25,419
Then gather people who are supportive of our company policy

2028
02:14:26,020 --> 02:14:27,239
Do you want to create a second union?

2029
02:14:27,442 --> 02:14:28,262
Yes

2030
02:14:29,145 --> 02:14:31,481
I will prepare funds of 200 million yen and 300 million yen

2031
02:14:32,114 --> 02:14:34,676
You must act in secret.

2032
02:15:04,840 --> 02:15:05,645
Makita-san

2033
02:15:06,434 --> 02:15:09,161
From now on, advanced technical education is required

2034
02:15:10,122 --> 02:15:13,864
Reduce general liberal arts departments and increase specialized departments

2035
02:15:14,372 --> 02:15:14,793
I see

2036
02:15:14,887 --> 02:15:16,739
It develops Japan

2037
02:15:17,770 --> 02:15:20,770
Technologyd countries dominate the world economy

2038
02:15:21,762 --> 02:15:25,192
I noticed it so I will invest in it

2039
02:15:27,606 --> 02:15:31,543
I have no profit but this is a national business

2040
02:15:32,528 --> 02:15:33,973
I think you are right

2041
02:15:34,098 --> 02:15:36,997
I will talk about it when I meet the Minister of Education next time.

2042
02:15:58,684 --> 02:15:59,801
What is master doing?

2043
02:16:00,168 --> 02:16:01,512
He is in ready to go

2044
02:16:09,340 --> 02:16:12,739
Congratulations on receiving the medal

2045
02:16:12,764 --> 02:16:14,231
Congratulations

2046
02:16:15,395 --> 02:16:16,411
Congratulations

2047
02:16:16,436 --> 02:16:17,582
Congratulations

2048
02:16:25,926 --> 02:16:27,223
Katsuhei Arima

2049
02:16:27,606 --> 02:16:32,301
You have been in the transportation business for many years

2050
02:16:32,918 --> 02:16:37,434
In developing the area along the railway line

2051
02:16:38,145 --> 02:16:44,082
You have developed society and contributed to the industry

2052
02:16:44,832 --> 02:16:50,122
I would like to commend you for your achievements

2053
02:16:50,973 --> 02:16:53,442
Prime Minister Takeo Ikehara

2054
02:17:12,786 --> 02:17:14,895
How do you feel about receiving the medal?

2055
02:17:15,028 --> 02:17:16,989
Not particularly good or bad

2056
02:17:18,942 --> 02:17:21,395
I heard you start an education business

2057
02:17:21,567 --> 02:17:26,489
Education business is hard to make a profit

2058
02:17:27,161 --> 02:17:30,215
I don't for profit

2059
02:17:30,457 --> 02:17:32,215
I do for society

2060
02:17:33,879 --> 02:17:34,809
I see

2061
02:17:35,575 --> 02:17:39,231
By the way I hear Heijito Yokota is your son

2062
02:17:39,739 --> 02:17:43,543
He took the entrance exam for my company and passed with excellent grades

2063
02:17:43,911 --> 02:17:45,286
He is good young man

2064
02:17:45,989 --> 02:17:48,418
You kidnap him

2065
02:17:50,207 --> 02:17:53,332
He seems to have filed a proceeding for recognition against you.

2066
02:17:53,481 --> 02:17:54,122
Yes

2067
02:17:54,559 --> 02:17:56,489
You should recognize him.

2068
02:17:56,723 --> 02:18:00,926
Let him write that you recognizes but does not give property

2069
02:18:01,739 --> 02:18:03,371
This is the best way

2070
02:18:03,396 --> 02:18:04,403
Chairman

2071
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:07,215
Excuse me

2072
02:18:08,450 --> 02:18:10,098
Chairman,There is a problem

2073
02:18:10,692 --> 02:18:11,770
School is on fire

2074
02:18:12,668 --> 02:18:13,372
School is on fire?

2075
02:18:14,075 --> 02:18:14,754
How much?

2076
02:18:14,779 --> 02:18:15,567
I don't know well

2077
02:18:15,715 --> 02:18:17,254
I just got a call from the head office

2078
02:18:17,356 --> 02:18:19,207
I hear our school is on fire

2079
02:18:19,973 --> 02:18:21,231
Don't make loud voice

2080
02:18:23,278 --> 02:18:24,817
I'm leaving here at 8 pm

2081
02:18:24,981 --> 02:18:26,622
Find out how much damage it did.

2082
02:18:26,832 --> 02:18:27,660
You go there first

2083
02:18:27,685 --> 02:18:28,247
Yes

2084
02:18:33,864 --> 02:18:35,239
I guess someone set on fire

2085
02:18:48,434 --> 02:18:49,247
Chairman is here

2086
02:18:53,683 --> 02:18:54,738
How much damage ?

2087
02:18:54,772 --> 02:18:55,590
Only classroom

2088
02:18:55,809 --> 02:18:58,301
The glass in the main building was just broken

2089
02:19:01,785 --> 02:19:05,426
Please arrange a disaster recovery related company

2090
02:19:05,451 --> 02:19:05,832
Yes

2091
02:19:06,075 --> 02:19:08,379
Please be sure to make it in time for the entrance ceremony

2092
02:19:08,404 --> 02:19:08,887
Yes

2093
02:19:12,842 --> 02:19:14,349
Someone set on fire as you thought

2094
02:19:22,467 --> 02:19:24,388
I will not return you home unless I speak honestly

2095
02:19:24,943 --> 02:19:27,943
I know what you did yesterday

2096
02:19:28,849 --> 02:19:30,998
Someone gave a secret notice

2097
02:19:31,865 --> 02:19:33,287
What did I do?

2098
02:19:33,802 --> 02:19:35,154
Please speak up.

2099
02:19:35,451 --> 02:19:37,904
I'm uncomfortable with suspicion.

2100
02:19:38,037 --> 02:19:38,787
Are you uncomfortable?

2101
02:19:39,748 --> 02:19:41,373
It's an exaggeration

2102
02:19:41,670 --> 02:19:42,834
Then I'll tell you

2103
02:19:43,396 --> 02:19:46,302
You set on fire to Seihoku school last night

2104
02:19:48,029 --> 02:19:49,943
You have only one parent?

2105
02:19:51,052 --> 02:19:54,138
I feel sorry for your mom.
You are unfaithful

2106
02:19:55,162 --> 02:19:56,748
Your mother must be crying now

2107
02:19:58,334 --> 02:20:00,357
Do you know what the punishment for arson is?

2108
02:20:01,545 --> 02:20:04,092
The person who set fire to the house where people live is sentenced to death

2109
02:20:04,513 --> 02:20:06,584
Or life imprisonment or imprisonment for 5 years or more

2110
02:20:07,467 --> 02:20:10,232
Two years or more imprisonment for arson in an uninhabited building

2111
02:20:12,076 --> 02:20:15,357
Well...Will you be in jail for 7 or 8 years?

2112
02:20:16,842 --> 02:20:19,162
What kind of grudge did you have at that school?

2113
02:20:19,427 --> 02:20:21,256
I said I didn't do anything!

2114
02:20:21,732 --> 02:20:25,302
I don't even know where his school is.

2115
02:20:26,217 --> 02:20:28,099
What proof do you guys have?

2116
02:20:28,248 --> 02:20:29,030
I get it

2117
02:20:29,670 --> 02:20:31,655
If you don't admit, stay here tonight

2118
02:20:32,905 --> 02:20:33,655
Stand up!

2119
02:20:35,389 --> 02:20:36,217
What the hell!

2120
02:20:42,975 --> 02:20:46,365
It has long been known that Arima's family has problems.

2121
02:20:47,342 --> 02:20:49,998
His life and dating are very simple

2122
02:20:50,444 --> 02:20:56,459
When he was young, his mistress went to buy beer when he had a visitor

2123
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,045
What is that?

2124
02:20:58,272 --> 02:20:59,475
This is your biographical book

2125
02:20:59,842 --> 02:21:02,709
I thought I will know better about you

2126
02:21:03,076 --> 02:21:04,506
I bought this on release day

2127
02:21:05,155 --> 02:21:06,201
All written in the book is lie

2128
02:21:06,412 --> 02:21:08,397
I often hear your rumors at parties

2129
02:21:08,530 --> 02:21:12,014
They say you are strong and powerful

2130
02:21:12,584 --> 02:21:17,420
But never mind.
The more I read the book the more I think you are amazing!

2131
02:21:23,123 --> 02:21:25,858
Hello? from Iwabuchi

2132
02:21:34,576 --> 02:21:36,584
It's me.
What can I do for you?

2133
02:21:37,350 --> 02:21:39,662
I got a call from police about the fire last night

2134
02:21:39,975 --> 02:21:41,420
Ok. then?

2135
02:21:41,686 --> 02:21:42,928
It seems that the criminal was found

2136
02:21:43,358 --> 02:21:44,108
But....

2137
02:21:45,389 --> 02:21:46,545
As I told you

2138
02:21:47,248 --> 02:21:48,537
It's Akihiko

2139
02:21:49,756 --> 02:21:50,756
What? Akihiko?

2140
02:21:51,967 --> 02:21:54,623
But he is in the hospital

2141
02:21:55,162 --> 02:21:56,389
He's turned himself in.

2142
02:21:56,733 --> 02:21:58,694
He said he got out of the hospital last night and set the school on fire

2143
02:21:59,584 --> 02:22:00,186
OK

2144
02:22:02,006 --> 02:22:02,545
I get it

2145
02:22:04,623 --> 02:22:05,787
What's wrong?

2146
02:22:06,615 --> 02:22:07,662
It's nothing

2147
02:22:08,373 --> 02:22:10,405
He has no hobbies

2148
02:22:10,561 --> 02:22:14,389
If he has a hobby, he can turn it into a business

2149
02:22:17,959 --> 02:22:21,459
He thinks it's his idea to make a business out of it.

2150
02:22:22,373 --> 02:22:24,694
He doesn't have a hobby so he doesn't need money

2151
02:22:25,037 --> 02:22:27,530
He has no desire to save his fortune

2152
02:22:28,053 --> 02:22:32,045
He uses the profits of the business for the business

2153
02:22:32,436 --> 02:22:35,662
He is not an old type of businessman

2154
02:22:36,280 --> 02:22:39,662
He recognizes freedom of thought and freedom of speech

2155
02:22:40,139 --> 02:22:42,240
He understands true democracy

2156
02:22:42,545 --> 02:22:45,319
He's a modern businessman.

2157
02:22:48,537 --> 02:22:51,326
I have been waiting for you

2158
02:22:54,069 --> 02:22:56,358
Your school has been burned

2159
02:23:03,662 --> 02:23:05,615
You have no right to run a school

2160
02:23:08,428 --> 02:23:11,342
You think I'm crazy, right?

2161
02:23:12,428 --> 02:23:14,225
But I'm not

2162
02:23:16,694 --> 02:23:18,115
You are crazy

2163
02:23:21,084 --> 02:23:23,475
A crazy man build a school and educate people

2164
02:23:24,998 --> 02:23:26,694
What will you teach them?

2165
02:23:28,936 --> 02:23:34,444
You don't care if other people die or kill themselves to make money.

2166
02:23:36,959 --> 02:23:39,537
You buy mistress

2167
02:23:40,780 --> 02:23:43,342
Do you train such people?

2168
02:23:55,959 --> 02:23:58,061
He has hopeless to get better

2169
02:24:23,233 --> 02:24:27,959
The Takeyama line will be open today

2170
02:24:28,100 --> 02:24:29,897
That's fine

2171
02:24:37,631 --> 02:24:40,561
What's wrong,Mom

2172
02:24:42,959 --> 02:24:43,686
Nothing

2173
02:24:44,483 --> 02:24:46,780
I just worry about Akihiko

2174
02:24:49,303 --> 02:24:51,006
Today is the opening ceremony of the Takeyama line

2175
02:24:52,576 --> 02:24:54,436
Congratulations

2176
02:24:55,444 --> 02:24:57,873
This is the business I put the most effort into

2177
02:24:58,326 --> 02:24:59,405
You can go to see how it looks

2178
02:25:00,303 --> 02:25:03,115
I will go to see Akihiko

2179
02:25:03,733 --> 02:25:06,686
He is banned from visiting under police guidance

2180
02:25:06,842 --> 02:25:09,889
Don't you think he's adorable?

2181
02:25:10,452 --> 02:25:12,756
Don't you think you want to see him?

2182
02:25:12,967 --> 02:25:14,202
I have no time

2183
02:25:15,303 --> 02:25:17,171
You are a terrible person

2184
02:25:18,163 --> 02:25:21,389
There is no warm heart in you

2185
02:25:22,874 --> 02:25:24,553
I don't want to say this but

2186
02:25:25,155 --> 02:25:30,444
You married me because you wanted business money from my dad

2187
02:25:31,428 --> 02:25:32,546
I've returned him the money

2188
02:25:33,725 --> 02:25:35,381
I don't mean that

2189
02:25:36,585 --> 02:25:40,975
He lent money to me and he going to use me

2190
02:25:41,842 --> 02:25:46,264
You have got a medal but I feel embarrassed

2191
02:25:48,022 --> 02:25:52,460
You think you can control people and the world.

2192
02:25:53,475 --> 02:25:55,280
Humans aren't what you think they are.

2193
02:26:01,569 --> 02:26:04,178
Dad, about second labor union

2194
02:26:04,764 --> 02:26:06,178
We are getting ready for that

2195
02:26:06,655 --> 02:26:09,733
Good.
Get it formed before the next fall strike.

2196
02:26:10,944 --> 02:26:13,178
I will not forgive those who oppose

2197
02:26:47,561 --> 02:26:49,374
So you won't let me to see him?

2198
02:26:49,835 --> 02:26:50,663
You can't

2199
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:55,389
It can't be helped because this is a hospital rule.

2200
02:26:56,233 --> 02:26:58,530
And he is under police's control

2201
02:27:15,022 --> 02:27:16,319
Oh..You are Arima's wife

2202
02:27:20,710 --> 02:27:21,413
Please

2203
02:27:24,241 --> 02:27:26,952
I got call so I asked police

2204
02:27:27,413 --> 02:27:29,139
They don't allow us to see him

2205
02:27:30,436 --> 02:27:32,178
By the way, do you know her?

2206
02:27:43,381 --> 02:27:44,171
Arima-san

2207
02:27:45,006 --> 02:27:45,796
Arima-san

2208
02:27:46,397 --> 02:27:47,444
There are visitors for you

2209
02:27:51,952 --> 02:27:52,663
Madam!

2210
02:27:55,319 --> 02:27:56,085
Look there

2211
02:27:59,631 --> 02:28:02,030
Akihiko-san.
I'm here

2212
02:28:14,280 --> 02:28:16,522
Akihiko-san!
Akihiko-san!

2213
02:28:36,116 --> 02:28:39,983
(Please forget about me)

2214
02:29:35,850 --> 02:29:37,358
Banzai!

2215
02:29:37,383 --> 02:29:39,061
Banzai!

2216
02:29:39,483 --> 02:29:41,092
Banzai!

2217
02:29:41,514 --> 02:29:42,796
Banzai!

2218
02:29:43,483 --> 02:29:44,694
Banzai!

2219
02:29:45,452 --> 02:29:46,850
Banzai!

2220
02:29:47,303 --> 02:29:49,030
Banzai!

2221
02:29:49,850 --> 02:29:51,288
Banzai!

2222
02:29:52,319 --> 02:29:53,749
Banzai!

2223
02:29:54,319 --> 02:29:56,147
Banzai!

2224
02:29:56,936 --> 02:29:58,460
Banzai!

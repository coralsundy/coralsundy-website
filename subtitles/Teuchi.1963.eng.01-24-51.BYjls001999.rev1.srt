00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:25,108
Teuchi (1963)

3
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:36,096
On 10/10 of the 2nd year of Meireki (1656)
A performance was held at Ohama Palace

4
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:12,115
Shindo

5
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:15,545
What can I do for you?

6
00:03:16,162 --> 00:03:17,693
Goroju is visiting you

7
00:03:18,436 --> 00:03:19,459
Please get back

8
00:03:20,045 --> 00:03:21,451
Goroju is visiting me?

9
00:03:26,453 --> 00:03:27,516
Please

10
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,664
OK

11
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:44,431
I'm here

12
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,345
What can I do for you?

13
00:03:58,145 --> 00:03:59,060
What can I do for you?

14
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:25,068
Joi

15
00:04:28,013 --> 00:04:36,052
You didn't know where you were and did something very rude today.

16
00:04:37,138 --> 00:04:40,232
so you have to commit seppuku

17
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:42,302
seppuku?

18
00:04:52,172 --> 00:04:54,242
I'll take it gratefully.

19
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:57,508
Do you have to commit seppuku because you yawned?

20
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,992
I yawned because I was bored

21
00:04:59,017 --> 00:05:00,539
I may have yawned too

22
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:02,688
It's bad for them to give a boring performance

23
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:06,180
Shindo..you shouldn't do seppuku

24
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,305
Yeah, We'll help you

25
00:05:08,563 --> 00:05:09,321
Yeah

26
00:05:09,734 --> 00:05:12,851
Shindo..you shouldn't do seppuku

27
00:05:14,297 --> 00:05:18,047
I replied, so I will commit seppuku

28
00:05:18,328 --> 00:05:19,797
What? stop it

29
00:05:19,822 --> 00:05:22,211
I've deiced my mind

30
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,432
Hey , listen

31
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:37,298
SHINDO's seppuku was ordered by Maeda.

32
00:05:37,369 --> 00:05:38,674
What? Maeda

33
00:05:39,486 --> 00:05:42,502
this is his plan

34
00:05:43,065 --> 00:05:44,861
SHINDO's yawning is an insult to Maeda

35
00:05:45,354 --> 00:05:50,002
I said that if we can't get rid of him, we'll send an army there.

36
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:52,166
They said like that?

37
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:58,541
The executives are going to hold Shindo accountable to calm the commotion.

38
00:06:01,707 --> 00:06:03,684
We can't accept

39
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:06,809
let's go talk to them

40
00:06:07,238 --> 00:06:08,816
Let's go

41
00:06:11,234 --> 00:06:12,313
Hold on

42
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:13,633
Gorotai

43
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,547
it's not good to hit them

44
00:06:17,789 --> 00:06:20,805
leave the matter to me

45
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:22,781
will you represent us?

46
00:06:22,945 --> 00:06:24,359
leave the matter to me

47
00:06:24,992 --> 00:06:30,313
Today's executives look like children to me

48
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:33,266
I'll go and beat them

49
00:06:33,766 --> 00:06:37,063
we should leave it to him

50
00:06:37,842 --> 00:06:40,295
Please help us

51
00:06:40,717 --> 00:06:41,631
do you go alone?

52
00:06:42,029 --> 00:06:42,842
Well

53
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,623
can someone go with me?

54
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,883
I'll go with you

55
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:53,242
Can you come with me?

56
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:53,750
Yes

57
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,340
genjiro..you shouldn't do seppuku

58
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,301
I will wait if you go to discuss

59
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:08,442
you are loyal,wait for us

60
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,620
Shall we go?

61
00:07:15,385 --> 00:07:18,253
genjiro..,wait for us

62
00:07:39,489 --> 00:07:46,880
Who do you think you owe your greatness to?

63
00:07:48,671 --> 00:07:53,585
Because the bannermen are working hard.

64
00:07:54,062 --> 00:07:57,281
It's never thanks to the feudal lords

65
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:06,538
Maeda was originally an enemy of the Tokugawa family.

66
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:14,616
I've heard their side of the story and made sense.

67
00:08:15,523 --> 00:08:18,445
But why are you guys forcing Mr. Shindo to commit seppuku?

68
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:21,117
I know how you feel

69
00:08:22,218 --> 00:08:28,328
But all the feudal lords in Japan are watching closely to see what will happen.

70
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:35,007
If the Shogunate rejects Maeda's offer in defense of SHINDO

71
00:08:35,617 --> 00:08:38,234
What would the foreign feudal lords think?

72
00:08:38,781 --> 00:08:43,914
The feudal lords from outside the shogunate are probably determined to distrust the Shogunate.

73
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:46,023
So what?

74
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:48,101
We don't have to worry about that

75
00:08:48,656 --> 00:08:52,789
The Shogunate today owes its existence to the bannermen

76
00:08:54,173 --> 00:09:02,141
We do not worship the lords of the outside world with all our hearts.

77
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:07,937
We must win the hearts of the lords.

78
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:10,253
Goroju

79
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,542
I understand what you say

80
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:20,652
but as your request

81
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:28,291
I think it's strange for Shindo to commit seppuku just because he yawned.

82
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:34,597
The feudal lords are fine, but they cannot suppress the discontent of the bannermen.

83
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:37,229
What do you think about this?

84
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:41,667
Bannermen are my people.

85
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,745
My people are patient.

86
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:50,253
They must put up with it

87
00:09:52,136 --> 00:09:54,792
Can Shindo-san become a victim of you guys?

88
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:56,229
It can't be helped

89
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:57,800
Aoyama

90
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:03,792
To save the big bug, Tokugawa, you have to kill the little bug.

91
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:07,917
SHindo is little bug?

92
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:09,542
Yes

93
00:10:10,931 --> 00:10:14,431
For the stability of the Tokugawa family

94
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,075
They are back!

95
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:50,359
Genjiro

96
00:10:53,898 --> 00:10:56,797
You don't have to say it.

97
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,803
Forgive me

98
00:11:05,584 --> 00:11:11,318
I am no longer an important person

99
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:16,336
my time is over

100
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:19,946
Forgive me

101
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:34,375
Ok,I'll do

102
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:39,759
Ok,I'll definitely do

103
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,165
but not easy to die

104
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:46,524
what are you going to do?

105
00:11:47,593 --> 00:11:49,485
i want to decide the place

106
00:11:49,772 --> 00:11:50,588
Where?

107
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,672
At Maeda place

108
00:11:56,495 --> 00:12:00,297
I cut myself in front of his house

109
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:40,007
Watch me carefully

110
00:12:41,413 --> 00:12:47,247
I will teach you how to cut the belly

111
00:12:58,594 --> 00:13:02,327
Maeda, take a good look at me

112
00:13:03,126 --> 00:13:07,483
you don't perform badly again

113
00:13:08,334 --> 00:13:14,662
I will teach for the Maeda family.
Make it your family motto.

114
00:14:00,244 --> 00:14:04,246
He was a good guy.
I never meant for any of this to happen.

115
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:08,855
He was my best friend.

116
00:14:10,192 --> 00:14:13,629
He was going to die a spectacular death.
He was  fool.

117
00:14:15,808 --> 00:14:19,350
he was a man who has put his life on the line for

118
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:22,290
the war is unlikely to end

119
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:28,600
After all, we may be Samurai, but we have no use in this world after all.

120
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:35,980
RIPS

121
00:14:38,263 --> 00:14:39,635
I'm leaving

122
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:45,733
Kiku

123
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:48,345
You got wet?

124
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:51,080
Don't worry about me

125
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:53,389
wipe with this

126
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,377
Tono

127
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:59,175
Tono

128
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:07,835
Welcome

129
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:10,161
i want to dry her clothes

130
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,106
We'll take a rest here

131
00:15:12,618 --> 00:15:14,493
I'll call workers

132
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,809
Drink and wait

133
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,821
Please come in

134
00:15:56,575 --> 00:15:59,170
You look good.

135
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:05,731
take a good rest today

136
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,881
Can I take a good rest today?

137
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:12,554
Are you glad?

138
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:16,591
I'm glad with you

139
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:21,595
In the mansion, you have to be careful about the eyes of the situation

140
00:16:23,706 --> 00:16:27,673
Never mind.
Women are a jealous lot.

141
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:36,350
You love me.
Don't be afraid of anyone.

142
00:16:38,826 --> 00:16:43,279
It's a waste if I'm the only one who's happy

143
00:16:44,164 --> 00:16:45,987
I'm afraid of my future

144
00:16:48,027 --> 00:16:48,513
Kiku

145
00:17:06,577 --> 00:17:07,480
Welcome back

146
00:17:10,014 --> 00:17:10,552
Guest?

147
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,667
KONDO and others are waiting for you!

148
00:17:25,926 --> 00:17:26,989
You back

149
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,653
we were waiting for you

150
00:17:34,114 --> 00:17:34,879
What's the matter with you?

151
00:17:36,426 --> 00:17:37,090
Look this

152
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:41,848
What do you mean?

153
00:17:42,434 --> 00:17:46,825
We can't take any more of these cowardly executives.

154
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:51,340
If they look down on us, we have plans too

155
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:55,036
we form a group to defeat them

156
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,426
We fight with the feudal lords to protect our pride

157
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:06,622
We would like to invite you to Hiratsuka group

158
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:10,347
That's a little rough, don't you think?

159
00:18:10,511 --> 00:18:12,050
Why you say so?

160
00:18:12,535 --> 00:18:14,300
Aren't you offended by the shogunate's way of doing things?

161
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:16,714
Are you going to waste Shindo's death?

162
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,636
He was my best friend

163
00:18:21,089 --> 00:18:23,761
I'm so frustrated

164
00:18:24,168 --> 00:18:25,144
So you should

165
00:18:26,082 --> 00:18:26,808
Listen

166
00:18:28,035 --> 00:18:30,714
We Hatamoto are the SS of the Tokugawa family.

167
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:34,300
What will happen to the Tokugawa family if we collapse?

168
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:42,121
We may destroy the history of the Tokugawa family

169
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,511
I don't care

170
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,964
The executives don't recognize us.

171
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:50,800
If they won't allow it, we will force it.

172
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,167
will you join us?

173
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:54,597
Tell me

174
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:57,144
We're friend,right?

175
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:01,928
Aoyama

176
00:19:16,296 --> 00:19:17,382
Welcome

177
00:19:17,897 --> 00:19:22,085
I was surprised.
Kiku is here

178
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,335
Kiku is here

179
00:19:24,765 --> 00:19:30,952
have you been away for a while?
you should marry a man sooner

180
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:35,387
What are you saying about?
Welcome her

181
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:38,465
you became more beautiful

182
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,364
What are you saying about?
She's my sister

183
00:19:46,082 --> 00:19:49,043
What?
Are you kiku?

184
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:55,097
you are my sister so beautiful

185
00:19:55,984 --> 00:19:57,406
What's the hell?

186
00:19:58,609 --> 00:20:00,734
This is a gift from Tono

187
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:03,523
Thank you very much

188
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:10,344
And I'm not just saying that because I got you this.
You should work hard.

189
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:15,469
She was so beautiful that I think you should marry her soon.

190
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:18,446
I think it's time for her to get married.

191
00:20:18,938 --> 00:20:20,625
That's right

192
00:20:22,352 --> 00:20:23,563
We don't have time

193
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,805
do you have a spouse?

194
00:20:26,922 --> 00:20:29,266
No way. I don't have

195
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:36,164
You should quit working at the mansion and get married soon.

196
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:39,753
Bros

197
00:20:40,917 --> 00:20:42,620
I'm not getting married.

198
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,667
Why you say so?

199
00:20:46,214 --> 00:20:49,644
I want to work in the current mansion forever

200
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:50,878
What's the hell?

201
00:20:50,903 --> 00:20:53,854
you must not be selfish

202
00:20:53,956 --> 00:20:56,456
women have an expiration date

203
00:20:56,815 --> 00:21:00,683
It's better to get married when you're young

204
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:01,315
Look her

205
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,175
What's the hell?

206
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:07,993
TONO will not be your husband

207
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:10,149
What are you talking about?

208
00:21:10,594 --> 00:21:12,290
She and he have different identities

209
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:17,626
you should have a commoner and a normal family

210
00:21:40,535 --> 00:21:41,277
I'm back

211
00:21:43,316 --> 00:21:44,245
who is the visitor?

212
00:21:44,691 --> 00:21:45,886
From Koishikawa

213
00:21:47,617 --> 00:21:51,179
he is a very difficult visitor

214
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:53,586
why did he come here?

215
00:21:53,914 --> 00:21:55,211
It's the usual business

216
00:21:55,703 --> 00:21:59,125
he seems to have become an affair

217
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:05,422
So I thought he came very often these days.

218
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:06,430
With whom?

219
00:22:06,781 --> 00:22:08,141
I don't know

220
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:11,359
Please take care of this

221
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:28,408
she changed her complexion

222
00:22:52,506 --> 00:22:54,334
Oh..Kiku

223
00:22:55,428 --> 00:22:57,381
you are beautiful as always

224
00:22:59,092 --> 00:23:02,553
you have a lot of trouble every day

225
00:23:03,553 --> 00:23:06,764
please have a little more patience

226
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,797
I'll call you when I need.
Get back

227
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:53,791
Let's hear your reply.

228
00:23:56,431 --> 00:23:57,087
harima?

229
00:23:59,853 --> 00:24:00,916
I decline

230
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:05,455
I'm not ready to take a wife yet

231
00:24:23,065 --> 00:24:25,737
What do you think of the current times

232
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:29,908
The Toyotomi family has fallen.

233
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:35,533
No longer do samurai take credit on the battlefield and rise to power There is no such thing as an uprising

234
00:24:36,092 --> 00:24:42,217
You must hold on to the vine of prosperity, thinking of the future through marriage

235
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:44,967
It is for the good of the house

236
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:47,092
I understand that much

237
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:48,357
You don't understand.

238
00:24:49,459 --> 00:24:51,623
GENJIRO SHINDO is the good example

239
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:53,256
SHINDO?

240
00:24:54,131 --> 00:24:59,553
He only understood what he was doing, and so he did a rash thing like standing up to the feudal lords.

241
00:25:00,244 --> 00:25:03,705
He has destroyed yourself and your ancestral home.

242
00:25:09,986 --> 00:25:11,970
Shindo has his own way of life

243
00:25:12,688 --> 00:25:14,086
That's what's wrong with him

244
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:21,587
They've been cracking down even harder on the Hatamoto since that incident.

245
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:29,717
If you think your house is important...

246
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,810
You must be very careful.

247
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:37,122
So

248
00:25:38,294 --> 00:25:41,794
You need a marriage that is good for my family and good for you.

249
00:25:47,943 --> 00:25:50,130
Fighting!

250
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:55,915
Fighting between Hiratsuka and Machiya

251
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,900
Hey guys!

252
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,358
How are you feeling?

253
00:27:18,452 --> 00:27:25,077
I have a short lifespan, so I hope I die soon.

254
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:26,303
Gorotai

255
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:29,546
don't care.

256
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:35,178
Old people like me are not important, but young people are.

257
00:27:36,497 --> 00:27:41,591
I asked you to follow the problem with the Hiratsuka group.

258
00:27:42,013 --> 00:27:43,567
Yes, I'm here for that matter too

259
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:45,622
Oh you knew

260
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:49,312
we are thinking the same

261
00:27:52,296 --> 00:27:58,452
someone has to be very strict

262
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:03,689
They will surely dig their own graves.

263
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:11,064
but i can't control them anymore

264
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:18,416
you are the only one who can control them

265
00:28:19,303 --> 00:28:26,365
Please take care of them for me

266
00:28:28,230 --> 00:28:30,214
I'm thinking the same

267
00:28:32,902 --> 00:28:34,441
I will join the Hiratsuka group

268
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:37,191
I am one with them.

269
00:28:38,206 --> 00:28:39,738
I understand how they feel

270
00:28:41,415 --> 00:28:43,633
I know I know

271
00:28:44,243 --> 00:28:48,493
To be a member of the Hiratsuka group I want to share their joys and sorrows

272
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:52,156
I don't know how much I can do

273
00:28:53,461 --> 00:28:55,062
Please, please

274
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,906
There is no one to protect them now

275
00:29:01,469 --> 00:29:04,375
You're the only one who can.

276
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:08,008
Please... please...

277
00:29:28,137 --> 00:29:31,387
Aoyama has joined us

278
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,926
Let's have a welcome party for him today

279
00:29:37,176 --> 00:29:40,465
bring a lot of alcohol

280
00:29:54,938 --> 00:29:57,188
Watch out! Okiku

281
00:29:57,867 --> 00:29:59,297
What's this?

282
00:30:01,321 --> 00:30:03,672
Are you ok?

283
00:30:05,782 --> 00:30:13,711
This is a gift dish that Ieyasu gave us.

284
00:30:15,344 --> 00:30:22,922
This is a family heirloom that should never be destroyed.

285
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,469
Is it such an important dish?

286
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:37,918
oh good

287
00:30:38,614 --> 00:30:41,770
Oh, thank God.

288
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:44,536
You saved your life.

289
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:46,653
Oh dear

290
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:49,707
Please clean up quickly.

291
00:30:54,236 --> 00:30:56,611
The person next door wants to talk to you

292
00:30:57,353 --> 00:30:57,955
The person next door?

293
00:30:58,252 --> 00:31:01,689
It seems that she suddenly took a vacation

294
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:10,111
did you take a vacation?

295
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:15,955
Thank you for your help until now. I will return to my hometown from today.

296
00:31:16,372 --> 00:31:17,943
Oh I see

297
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:20,677
I'm here to greet you

298
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:23,044
Take care

299
00:31:37,686 --> 00:31:43,827
how did she suddenly quit her job?
I heard that she has a good relationship with the lord.

300
00:31:44,531 --> 00:31:46,141
He found new one

301
00:31:46,937 --> 00:31:48,008
with the lord?

302
00:31:48,484 --> 00:31:49,953
Yes, so she was fired

303
00:31:51,297 --> 00:31:54,437
I feel sorry for her.
It's not good to have a romantic relationship with him

304
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:59,680
If a retainer falls in love with his master

305
00:32:01,766 --> 00:32:06,617
then it doesn't matter if he is abandoned or killed.

306
00:32:07,711 --> 00:32:11,289
Yeah, let's get back to work

307
00:32:27,753 --> 00:32:29,292
I'm glad

308
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,659
My thoughts have come true.

309
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:34,956
What do you mean?

310
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:43,422
My first experience I always wanted to be with you

311
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:55,091
I forgot my inro in the parlor.
Please bring it

312
00:32:55,435 --> 00:32:59,873
I get it.
I forgot my inro in the parlor

313
00:33:55,749 --> 00:33:56,468
What's wrong?

314
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,110
Welcome back

315
00:34:07,219 --> 00:34:08,453
Are you crying?

316
00:34:09,219 --> 00:34:11,985
did you quarrel with someone?

317
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:13,961
I'm not crying

318
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,797
I need to see your face

319
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:18,256
You can't?

320
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:19,835
Tell me

321
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:22,585
you should be honest

322
00:34:28,821 --> 00:34:29,548
Kiku

323
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:34,571
Sorry.
I was kidding

324
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,192
What's wrong?

325
00:34:44,552 --> 00:34:49,654
Can a wimp be a bannerman's wife ?

326
00:34:51,874 --> 00:34:55,695
Can I be a bannerman's wife?

327
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,015
No wonder

328
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:02,023
samurai don't lie

329
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:06,632
But my next door...

330
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:08,538
Oh you know

331
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:13,499
That's a very unavoidable circumstance.

332
00:35:15,249 --> 00:35:16,718
So You were crying?

333
00:35:18,109 --> 00:35:19,609
You're stupid

334
00:35:22,503 --> 00:35:24,964
So you mean...

335
00:35:25,886 --> 00:35:35,776
No matter how many women there are in this world. You are the only woman I love

336
00:35:37,989 --> 00:35:39,254
Lord

337
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:47,716
no matter what i won't let you go

338
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:56,450
Even if I lose my job, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

339
00:35:57,910 --> 00:36:01,215
I'm really glad

340
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:04,754
Trust me

341
00:36:14,734 --> 00:36:16,390
I'm back

342
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:17,749
Welcome back

343
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:21,374
Did you see Kiku today?

344
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,717
i haven't seen her since that time

345
00:36:25,812 --> 00:36:27,304
i heard a rumor

346
00:36:27,703 --> 00:36:29,539
About Kiku?

347
00:36:29,726 --> 00:36:31,311
Not but Hiratsuka

348
00:36:31,711 --> 00:36:33,179
What's wrong?

349
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:42,155
They are so ferocious that they even challenge officials.

350
00:36:42,765 --> 00:36:47,163
now they are under control but

351
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:53,741
But it is expected that in the future they will be punished.

352
00:36:54,062 --> 00:36:56,038
How about Aoyama lord?

353
00:36:56,234 --> 00:36:59,327
He's good man

354
00:36:59,749 --> 00:37:09,444
because he is a very nice person,The young hatamotos are trying to take advantage of him.

355
00:37:09,702 --> 00:37:14,359
That's bad.
Okiku should leave from the house

356
00:37:14,619 --> 00:37:18,267
Yes, true.
He's good man

357
00:37:18,635 --> 00:37:23,853
But he has a samurai spirit

358
00:37:24,111 --> 00:37:26,846
you go house and see how it goes

359
00:37:27,017 --> 00:37:31,236
I can't.
i don't like them

360
00:37:32,306 --> 00:37:34,783
Oh yeah,you go house and see how it goes

361
00:37:35,267 --> 00:37:35,846
Me?

362
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:39,010
you are good at talking

363
00:37:39,267 --> 00:37:42,416
And it's better if a woman goes

364
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:45,963
When a woman goes, the place softens.

365
00:37:49,424 --> 00:37:50,635
I'm counting on you

366
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:59,574
did you have anything to do with lord

367
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:07,963
I had a sudden feeling the other day, but I didn't say anything because I was in front of my brother.

368
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:12,151
Oh you are...

369
00:38:16,049 --> 00:38:17,002
That's what I thought

370
00:38:24,976 --> 00:38:27,492
But that's not right.

371
00:38:28,781 --> 00:38:35,273
Think about it.
You and him have different identities

372
00:38:35,741 --> 00:38:38,749
He told me he didn't care

373
00:38:39,311 --> 00:38:43,960
It could be but don't trust his words

374
00:38:44,421 --> 00:38:50,718
what would you do if you got dumped like his ex lover?

375
00:38:51,806 --> 00:38:55,017
My brother was worried about you too

376
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:58,548
I'm going to stay by him for the rest of my life.

377
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,376
are you going to marry him?

378
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,933
looks like he committed suicide with geisha?

379
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,371
he committed suicide with geisha?

380
00:39:20,972 --> 00:39:23,230
Don't look

381
00:39:23,847 --> 00:39:24,972
Go home

382
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:31,120
Don't look, I'll kill you

383
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:36,331
Is he mori?

384
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:49,573
The woman is Tamagiku?

385
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:53,893
I met her that night.
I feel sorry

386
00:39:55,065 --> 00:39:59,080
He was serious man, but he seemed agitated.

387
00:40:17,602 --> 00:40:22,328
he tried to get her out of her current job

388
00:40:23,828 --> 00:40:27,883
I feel sorry about him

389
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:33,442
He lover her so much

390
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:36,294
He's kind

391
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:41,958
He seems to have committed suicide after being accused by officials.

392
00:40:43,025 --> 00:40:44,846
I feel sorry about him

393
00:40:46,049 --> 00:40:49,877
But i think she was happy

394
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:56,189
You think so,Kiku?

395
00:40:57,307 --> 00:41:04,174
I think it's a woman's long-cherished desire to die being loved.

396
00:41:10,354 --> 00:41:10,776
Kiku

397
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:33,427
Aoyama

398
00:41:41,724 --> 00:41:47,232
Aoyama. Gorotai old man is in danger

399
00:41:57,952 --> 00:42:00,624
You guys are here

400
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:03,280
Rakutaro

401
00:42:04,795 --> 00:42:09,163
I'm your father

402
00:42:10,014 --> 00:42:14,553
Ill go to heaven

403
00:42:27,823 --> 00:42:36,026
I have been protecting Ieyasu Tokugawa since I was 96 years old.

404
00:42:37,026 --> 00:42:40,488
Losing to Imagawa

405
00:42:41,371 --> 00:42:45,707
I fought Takeda

406
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:55,262
I have endured hardships and hardships in accordance with the outline, wishing for the Tokugawa world.

407
00:42:57,019 --> 00:43:01,269
and we took over the world

408
00:43:03,613 --> 00:43:09,707
But when Tokugawa thought he had taken over the world,

409
00:43:12,516 --> 00:43:18,149
I've become someone they don't need

410
00:43:21,947 --> 00:43:23,134
So be careful

411
00:43:24,806 --> 00:43:31,509
If the Tokugawa shogunate went out of control

412
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,042
You can't handle them

413
00:43:40,147 --> 00:43:49,709
If someone who interferes with them appears

414
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:55,653
they kill them mercilessly

415
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:00,785
So put it up

416
00:44:02,504 --> 00:44:03,668
put it up

417
00:44:05,653 --> 00:44:13,200
this is the only way you can live

418
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:15,653
You get it?

419
00:44:19,007 --> 00:44:21,640
this is my will

420
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:31,077
Gorotai...

421
00:45:41,716 --> 00:45:42,583
Maeda!

422
00:45:42,731 --> 00:45:44,653
They are coming

423
00:45:44,763 --> 00:45:47,388
The bad guys who made Shindo HARAKIRI

424
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:48,364
Beat them

425
00:45:48,389 --> 00:45:49,138
Wait

426
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,567
Did you forget about Gorotai's will?

427
00:45:51,653 --> 00:45:54,692
I'll beat them first

428
00:46:05,282 --> 00:46:07,641
Follow him

429
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,624
Wait!Wait!Wait!

430
00:47:07,364 --> 00:47:08,560
Catch them

431
00:47:20,702 --> 00:47:23,272
Come on

432
00:48:21,975 --> 00:48:28,615
On behalf of all the 300 lords and princes of Japan, I hereby submit a request for an order to the Shogunate

433
00:48:30,174 --> 00:48:36,814
They are confusing the MAEDA team
I want you to dispose of Hiratsuka immediately.

434
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:40,054
If not, we ask that you hand them over to us.

435
00:48:40,452 --> 00:48:46,507
if you can't do it we will beat them

436
00:49:13,424 --> 00:49:20,447
let us think about that for a moment

437
00:49:34,858 --> 00:49:38,491
We have already committed seppuku against SHIBNDO Genjiro.

438
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:43,061
If we punish the entire HIRATSUKA clan again now.

439
00:49:44,413 --> 00:49:46,092
The other Hatamoto will not remain silent.

440
00:49:46,459 --> 00:49:56,373
If they rebel as a group, it will be a big deal in the world.

441
00:49:56,761 --> 00:50:00,300
But we cannot hold back the bannermen any longer

442
00:50:01,183 --> 00:50:04,558
Then how can we save the face of the Daimyo?

443
00:51:24,314 --> 00:51:30,017
In ten years, maybe five,

444
00:51:30,997 --> 00:51:32,951
things will be different.

445
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:37,818
But for now, as of today,

446
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:45,130
 the Shogunate must only go along with what the lords say.

447
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:50,437
So about Hiratsuka's...

448
00:51:50,751 --> 00:51:58,361
But if we don't want to kill them, we have no choice but to make peace with the lords.

449
00:52:01,065 --> 00:52:01,979
make peace?

450
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:06,300
Yeah

451
00:52:09,011 --> 00:52:09,847
make peace

452
00:52:38,897 --> 00:52:40,280
I'm here

453
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,491
Welcome

454
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:47,593
Thank you.
I have something to tell you

455
00:52:48,069 --> 00:52:50,351
Come closer

456
00:53:00,483 --> 00:53:06,514
A princess named Akihime is related to Mr. Maeda.

457
00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:14,138
I think it's possible to connect her with Hiratsuka-gumi

458
00:53:14,904 --> 00:53:18,232
Triggered reconciliation between daimyo and hatamoto

459
00:53:19,732 --> 00:53:26,919
I think this is a very positive aspect, but he is very stubborn.

460
00:53:28,396 --> 00:53:31,709
He has had so many blind dates.

461
00:53:32,443 --> 00:53:34,514
We have to carry on this

462
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,083
For our world

463
00:53:41,552 --> 00:53:45,552
we expect that

464
00:53:48,122 --> 00:53:54,333
Everyone is very troubled about Maeda's problem.

465
00:53:55,346 --> 00:53:59,892
The General also very much wants them to get married.

466
00:54:00,846 --> 00:54:04,119
I really understand what they say

467
00:54:06,637 --> 00:54:12,262
I was so surprised when I heard.

468
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:16,441
You'll be Aoyama's wife

469
00:54:18,824 --> 00:54:21,144
I thought I was dreaming

470
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:26,792
Anyway you're Aoyama's wife

471
00:54:27,386 --> 00:54:31,652
it's very congratulations

472
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,402
Don't act like that

473
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:37,526
I'm so horned

474
00:54:40,324 --> 00:54:43,714
he cries with joy

475
00:54:45,943 --> 00:54:51,475
I will become the brother-in-law of the lord

476
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:57,006
I am honored

477
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:06,874
it's very congratulations

478
00:55:10,086 --> 00:55:14,812
Yeah, it was really nice. I'm really happy that you became the wife of the Tono.

479
00:55:16,031 --> 00:55:20,093
That's because you're a good girl, Okiku. You're a good girl.

480
00:55:21,461 --> 00:55:23,312
Thanks

481
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:26,343
Please take good care of him

482
00:55:27,906 --> 00:55:34,069
Please take good care of him

483
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:52,163
Are you sure that Aoyama will come?

484
00:55:53,834 --> 00:55:55,194
He'll be sure to come

485
00:55:56,662 --> 00:56:01,897
Did you tell him about Hiratsuka's disposition?

486
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,850
I bet he knew

487
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:11,937
I'm going to see the cherry blossoms today, so how about this kimono?

488
00:56:13,601 --> 00:56:15,616
Shall I prepare another kimono?

489
00:56:16,444 --> 00:56:17,296
That is ok

490
00:56:17,858 --> 00:56:21,280
Aunt Koishikawa is coming today, so that's fine.

491
00:56:23,257 --> 00:56:25,038
Oh she's coming

492
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,546
What's wrong?

493
00:56:31,196 --> 00:56:32,501
she comes here for today's problem

494
00:56:34,344 --> 00:56:38,508
you shouldn't think weird

495
00:57:31,137 --> 00:57:32,480
She's princess

496
00:57:33,871 --> 00:57:36,988
Thank you for coming

497
00:57:38,414 --> 00:57:42,188
He is my nephew Haruma Aoyama

498
00:57:53,286 --> 00:57:55,848
please start the ritual

499
00:58:17,191 --> 00:58:23,199
She's the princess... so graceful...

500
00:58:26,199 --> 00:58:28,059
and so beautiful.

501
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:40,927
Someone's here to see me?

502
00:58:41,138 --> 00:58:45,935
Auntie is here to introduce a woman

503
00:58:46,854 --> 00:58:47,839
a woman?

504
00:58:53,522 --> 00:58:55,655
how old is she?

505
00:58:55,827 --> 00:58:57,038
19years old

506
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:58,397
19years old?

507
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,210
She's one year younger than Okiku.

508
00:59:01,296 --> 00:59:01,921
How does she look?

509
00:59:02,038 --> 00:59:05,515
 I hear she's the most beautiful of the brothers.

510
00:59:09,616 --> 00:59:11,952
Who’s the hell is she?

511
00:59:12,702 --> 00:59:15,132
she is the matchmaker of the lord

512
00:59:15,984 --> 00:59:18,116
She's Daimyo"s daughter

513
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:27,037
Okiku, take out that plate

514
00:59:27,685 --> 00:59:28,412
 that plate?

515
00:59:28,505 --> 00:59:30,670
An important customer is coming

516
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:35,123
The shop is very important, so please take it carefully.

517
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:22,609
he's going to have a date

518
01:01:25,898 --> 01:01:27,117
A princess

519
01:01:30,390 --> 01:01:35,437
I really worry....

520
01:01:38,845 --> 01:01:41,384
But...

521
01:03:53,979 --> 01:03:57,050
Harima! You are rude!

522
01:03:57,737 --> 01:04:00,346
i can't take it anymore sorry

523
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:03,979
you must apologize to her

524
01:04:04,104 --> 01:04:05,354
Harima

525
01:04:05,379 --> 01:04:06,096
Aoyama

526
01:04:08,557 --> 01:04:10,682
hold on, Harima Aoyama

527
01:04:20,408 --> 01:04:21,111
Roju

528
01:04:22,681 --> 01:04:27,931
We can no longer reconcile with the daimyo

529
01:04:29,314 --> 01:04:35,564
The Hiratsuka group says they will attack Aoyama's house.

530
01:04:36,970 --> 01:04:37,814
I know

531
01:04:38,173 --> 01:04:39,743
What? You know?

532
01:04:47,228 --> 01:04:47,947
Sorry

533
01:04:58,517 --> 01:05:01,853
did you break that plate?

534
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,946
I think the lord will be very angry if he comes back.

535
01:05:09,189 --> 01:05:12,056
you will be severely punished

536
01:05:13,212 --> 01:05:14,400
Okiku broke that plate?

537
01:05:14,657 --> 01:05:16,150
That Korai plate?

538
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:21,548
Oh my god , the lord will come back soon

539
01:05:22,126 --> 01:05:23,517
the lord will come back soon?

540
01:05:38,846 --> 01:05:39,690
Lord!

541
01:05:41,448 --> 01:05:42,620
What's wrong?

542
01:05:42,878 --> 01:05:46,323
big problem happened

543
01:05:47,698 --> 01:05:48,542
Look at this

544
01:05:59,754 --> 01:06:03,910
who broke the precious plate?

545
01:06:04,856 --> 01:06:05,621
Who?

546
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:12,087
I broke it

547
01:06:21,267 --> 01:06:23,837
Did you break it?

548
01:06:25,158 --> 01:06:26,283
Yes I did

549
01:06:27,162 --> 01:06:27,764
You

550
01:06:31,833 --> 01:06:35,247
Are you sure?

551
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:43,458
i will take any punishment

552
01:06:56,527 --> 01:07:00,949
I think it can't be helped if I accidentally break it

553
01:07:02,230 --> 01:07:04,792
Will you forgive us?

554
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:11,345
Be sure to reflect on this.

555
01:07:12,681 --> 01:07:13,353
Yes

556
01:07:18,053 --> 01:07:20,264
We saved our life

557
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:24,115
Okiku was forgiven

558
01:07:27,086 --> 01:07:29,321
I think to him

559
01:07:29,765 --> 01:07:33,633
He said that if she accidentally broke a plate, she would not be punished.

560
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:35,680
She said she broke accidentally?

561
01:07:36,141 --> 01:07:37,438
What are you talking about?

562
01:07:37,633 --> 01:07:40,024
She broke it on purpose

563
01:07:40,641 --> 01:07:41,578
What?

564
01:07:42,938 --> 01:07:45,922
Forget about the plate

565
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:51,758
Give me the coat

566
01:08:06,565 --> 01:08:07,791
why are you crying?

567
01:08:08,822 --> 01:08:11,807
I'm so happy

568
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,103
Are you happy so much?

569
01:08:15,713 --> 01:08:20,151
I am the happiest person in Japan

570
01:08:22,103 --> 01:08:28,033
I'm not trying to kill you just by breaking a plate

571
01:08:31,978 --> 01:08:35,275
please forgive me

572
01:08:36,103 --> 01:08:36,791
What do you mean?

573
01:08:37,994 --> 01:08:39,572
For what?

574
01:08:40,275 --> 01:08:43,384
I did....I did...

575
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,509
What's wrong?

576
01:08:50,407 --> 01:08:52,173
Actually

577
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:54,220
Lord

578
01:08:56,385 --> 01:08:56,963
Lord

579
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:58,534
What's wrong?

580
01:08:58,932 --> 01:09:03,120
Kiku broke the place on purpose

581
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:04,676
She broke it herself?

582
01:09:05,294 --> 01:09:08,137
there are eyewitnesses

583
01:09:11,689 --> 01:09:17,314
You said you accidentally broke the plate

584
01:09:17,627 --> 01:09:18,791
Not accidentally

585
01:09:18,845 --> 01:09:19,900
Shut up

586
01:09:24,438 --> 01:09:28,047
you accidentally broke the plate,right?

587
01:09:30,438 --> 01:09:33,672
He is saying true

588
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:36,727
You broke it yourself?

589
01:09:36,752 --> 01:09:37,063
Yes

590
01:09:37,883 --> 01:09:38,446
You broke it

591
01:09:44,109 --> 01:09:45,296
You guys go back

592
01:10:07,829 --> 01:10:12,923
We are just two here

593
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:15,603
Lord

594
01:10:16,736 --> 01:10:19,212
Tell me

595
01:10:21,079 --> 01:10:25,556
Why did you break that plate knowing that you would be killed?

596
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:31,102
Kiku

597
01:10:36,454 --> 01:10:40,798
I didn't know today's cherry-blossom viewing party was your matchmaking party.

598
01:10:42,477 --> 01:10:47,415
I lost track of what you were thinking when I heard that

599
01:10:48,946 --> 01:10:52,532
i want to know your true feelings

600
01:10:53,227 --> 01:10:56,696
You got off that plate to know my true feelings

601
01:10:58,071 --> 01:11:05,981
You tried to make sure I cared about you or about that plate.

602
01:11:06,895 --> 01:11:07,598
Yes

603
01:11:08,348 --> 01:11:10,450
Are you sure?

604
01:11:10,958 --> 01:11:11,567
Yes

605
01:11:13,247 --> 01:11:13,833
Kiku

606
01:11:16,192 --> 01:11:22,067
did you forget i said i will always be with you

607
01:11:23,895 --> 01:11:28,559
Did you forget that I can only love you?

608
01:11:32,795 --> 01:11:34,350
why didn't you trust me?

609
01:11:36,022 --> 01:11:40,693
Forgive me.
Do women get jealous easily

610
01:11:42,693 --> 01:11:45,115
Forgive me.

611
01:11:45,811 --> 01:11:50,303
I feel bad for being suspected

612
01:11:54,545 --> 01:11:58,865
As you thought, I had an arranged date today.

613
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:05,889
If I accept it, my house and the Hiratsuka group will be safe.

614
01:12:07,154 --> 01:12:08,342
But I was confuses

615
01:12:10,490 --> 01:12:15,709
But I would like to give up my position and live with you.

616
01:12:44,183 --> 01:12:47,136
Put out this plate

617
01:12:52,630 --> 01:12:53,622
Put out this plate

618
01:12:55,114 --> 01:12:55,810
Yes

619
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:27,038
You get it?

620
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:33,811
I do not forgive you for sparing the plate.

621
01:13:39,011 --> 01:13:39,886
Lord

622
01:13:41,909 --> 01:13:45,206
please defeat me

623
01:13:54,289 --> 01:14:02,436
I doubt your pure heart.
please defeat me

624
01:14:10,906 --> 01:14:11,547
Kiku

625
01:14:14,813 --> 01:14:24,578
When I knows a man's pure heart

626
01:14:25,398 --> 01:14:28,461
I'm willing to die as punishment

627
01:14:32,412 --> 01:14:38,122
I don't mind dying for that love

628
01:16:43,842 --> 01:16:47,077
treasure shattered

629
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:52,339
my love is gone

630
01:17:06,059 --> 01:17:06,684
Lord

631
01:17:10,051 --> 01:17:11,613
tell her brother

632
01:17:13,481 --> 01:17:14,629
What the hell

633
01:17:16,059 --> 01:17:19,199
You guys wait here

634
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:29,749
He acts first

635
01:17:31,155 --> 01:17:37,772
he seems to have made up his mind

636
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:41,667
He's strong

637
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:51,229
He's a great samurai, but do we have to get rid of him?

638
01:17:54,933 --> 01:17:56,214
It can't helped

639
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:17,855
why were you punished?

640
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:19,738
why?

641
01:18:20,582 --> 01:18:24,566
You were so happy to be the lord's wife.

642
01:18:24,957 --> 01:18:28,160
And now you look like this.

643
01:18:36,964 --> 01:18:37,706
Lord

644
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:41,636
What's wrong about my sis?

645
01:18:42,377 --> 01:18:43,565
why do you wear that dress?

646
01:18:44,643 --> 01:18:49,659
She and I vowed our future together, so I will die with her.

647
01:18:51,146 --> 01:18:51,927
Lord

648
01:19:01,717 --> 01:19:05,099
Forgive me,i understand your sorrow

649
01:19:07,006 --> 01:19:09,662
she was unlucky to fall in love with me

650
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,959
you'll die with her....

651
01:19:14,201 --> 01:19:15,966
i apologize to her in heaven

652
01:19:17,709 --> 01:19:19,639
Take it for me

653
01:19:50,867 --> 01:19:51,836
this is a wedding dress

654
01:19:52,852 --> 01:19:54,961
put it on her

655
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:58,364
Kiku

656
01:20:01,356 --> 01:20:05,973
you could marry him

657
01:20:06,996 --> 01:20:08,473
Stay with him forever

658
01:20:08,864 --> 01:20:13,293
really you are happy

659
01:20:56,117 --> 01:21:05,968
You have formed a faction with the Hiratsuka clan and have often been lawless, and for this reason I have asked you to commit seppuku.

660
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:20,348
I'll take it

661
01:21:32,536 --> 01:21:35,879
GOROJU mentioned

662
01:21:37,067 --> 01:21:41,621
Nothing has changed for the Hiratsuka group

663
01:21:50,946 --> 01:21:52,727
Thank you very much

664
01:23:56,008 --> 01:23:59,601
Kiku,wait for me

665
01:24:01,022 --> 01:24:04,358
Let's go to the heaven together

666
01:24:40,073 --> 01:24:47,081
THE END

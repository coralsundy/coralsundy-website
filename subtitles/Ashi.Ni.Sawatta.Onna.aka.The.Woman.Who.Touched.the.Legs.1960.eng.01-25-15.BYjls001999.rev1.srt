00:00:33,288 --> 00:00:41,488
<i>Ashi Ni Sawatta Onna / The Woman Who Touched the Legs (1960)</i>

3
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:59,748
I glanced out the window and was struck by a mysterious feeling

4
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:02,378
The unfamiliar scenery flies away

5
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,180
I should be on the express train to Tokyo

6
00:02:07,677 --> 00:02:09,818
The Tokaido is, so to speak, a well-traveled line.

7
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,322
There's no place like this along the line

8
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,440
I became worried and stood up to ask the conductor

9
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,082
The train boy was found before the conductor,

10
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,239
but he didn't wake up no matter how much I called out to him

11
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,765
When I got closer,

12
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,790
I smelled a sickening drunken scent

13
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,290
I proceeded to the next carriage to look for the car

14
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,154
I prefer to be smaller

15
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,062
It fits in my palm like this.

16
00:02:54,196 --> 00:02:55,250
You demand so much.

17
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,184
Here it is.

18
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:03,047
More discount.

19
00:03:03,496 --> 00:03:08,541
They deal pistols.Even when I approached themon the train, they pretended not to notice me.

20
00:03:09,426 --> 00:03:12,426
There should be a sense of public safety on express trains

21
00:03:32,577 --> 00:03:34,675
The train is running in a strange place

22
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,636
There are people buying and selling handguns.

23
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:40,236
I spoke to him, but the police officer glared at me and said, "Shut up,

24
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,260
are you trying to criticize my win?"

25
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,851
He pulled out his gun and aimed it at me

26
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:54,839
My throat was dry and my knees were shaking

27
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:15,824
The dining car was like a bar. There were bills on the counter like tissues.

28
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,697
I have no use for these guys

29
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,789
I thought I'd go to the engine room.

30
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,179
when I finally got there, there was a gangster in the engine room

31
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,076
You know?

32
00:04:36,112 --> 00:04:39,112
Next time you come to a junction, turn left again.

33
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,253
Forgive me....

34
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,048
I turned left just now.

35
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,532
Due to this, the train timetable is a mess.

36
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:47,645
Shut up!

37
00:04:48,178 --> 00:04:49,265
Or I'll shoot you.

38
00:04:50,988 --> 00:04:54,230
So if I die, who will run this train?

39
00:04:55,672 --> 00:04:59,057
Just one left turn is enough if you give me just 100,000 yen.

40
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:02,490
I'll give you another 300,000.

41
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:18,486
If we are on a train and I can't trust the
driver, who can we trust?

42
00:05:18,806 --> 00:05:20,653
I feel bad.

43
00:05:21,815 --> 00:05:22,868
Where is here?

44
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,967
Isn't it Japan? Isn't it the country where I was born?

45
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:33,143
Such crimes have become commonplace in Japan

46
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:40,263
The terminal symptoms of criminal Japanese capitalism. It is only natural that the world will become like this

47
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:44,872
in a world where consumption, greed and money rule everything

48
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:51,424
Money, money, money, what can we do without it?

49
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,704
Kill or be killed?

50
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,847
I have made up my mind

51
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,695
I want what I want

52
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,812
I pulled out a bunch of Colts from under my shirt

53
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,746
I yelled

54
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:15,285
I yelled some more.

55
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,221
Hey.

56
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:06,850
isn't this your wallet?

57
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,343
It's hot.

58
00:07:33,841 --> 00:07:34,694
It tastes good.

59
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,465
Where did you buy that lunch box?

60
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:53,471
This is not a lunch box

61
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:59,974
But a train lunch box is usually one you buy through the window at a train stop.

62
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:04,236
You can't do that on the express train.

63
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:10,875
on the express train, the woman in the dining room walks around in a bun

64
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,958
If you miss out on that, you won't be able to eat anything until Tokyo.

65
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,736
Because it should be a public railway agency

66
00:08:17,773 --> 00:08:23,344
Railroad companies contract with cafeteria companies.
There stuff we should buy.

67
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,292
Did you eat that lunch?

68
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:26,551
That's what I think.

69
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:27,578
Did she pass by here?

70
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:30,232
Yes I bought it from her.

71
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,643
You were so busy reading your book.

72
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:35,097
I didn't notice.

73
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,949
What is that?

74
00:08:38,482 --> 00:08:39,856
A crime Japan.

75
00:08:41,023 --> 00:08:42,270
Auther: Gomi Kosuke

76
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:46,809
He writes like this.

77
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,896
Gomu Kosuke, not Gomi

78
00:08:50,928 --> 00:08:52,329
What do you mean?

79
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,679
Gomi means dust.

80
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,370
I meant Gomi Kosuke who was linguist.

81
00:08:59,269 --> 00:09:00,615
I never heard of him.

82
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,110
I am a fan of Gomu Kosuke

83
00:09:04,689 --> 00:09:05,820
I respect him.

84
00:09:06,114 --> 00:09:08,327
 I've never heard of him.

85
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:09,386
Hes great.

86
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,406
The book is interesting?

87
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,126
Yes.

88
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:12,377
Let me see.

89
00:09:12,809 --> 00:09:14,639
I'm reading a really interesting part right now,

90
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,097
so can you go to the dining car?

91
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:16,825
There are some foods?

92
00:09:17,115 --> 00:09:19,700
Yes. go there.

93
00:09:22,952 --> 00:09:27,483
This novel is shit

94
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:23,311
I understand your careful consideration very well

95
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,190
If you think about it more casually, you will be able to write more easily

96
00:10:27,123 --> 00:10:30,470
Our editor-in-chief also emphasized this

97
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,520
I have also been told that you will receive a special manuscript fee

98
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,797
I don't want money.

99
00:10:39,457 --> 00:10:40,517
What I want is free time.

100
00:10:40,797 --> 00:10:41,870
 I understand that

101
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,460
But you are great, the magazines want you.

102
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:50,039
Novels like "Criminal Japan" are hidden bestsellers

103
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,810
What I'm writing is a novel called Crime Japan

104
00:10:56,877 --> 00:11:00,831
This is well sold but The pundits do not approve of my novel.

105
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:02,630
I mean...

106
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:05,910
I knew.. you are Weekly Jabon,right?

107
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,880
Speaking of Weekly Jabon, it's one of the best among the many weekly publications out here

108
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,114
I'm a third-rate novelist,

109
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,000
so you're too superior

110
00:11:13,376 --> 00:11:15,355
Don't say that?

111
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,616
What?

112
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,428
I only tell the truth.

113
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:22,231
You are all very elegant people

114
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:25,548
You must think my novel is a gross exaggeration.

115
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,165
but that's just how Japan is now.

116
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:31,427
Japan is in an unbelievable state right now

117
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,934
For example, I saw the word "buffet" written at the entrance to the restaurant

118
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,008
When I first saw it, I thought it was a toilet

119
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,555
In Japan, Japanese people can read it, but Japanese people don't understand the meaning of the characters

120
00:11:46,153 --> 00:11:47,542
 that's incomprehensible.

121
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,202
but that's reality.

122
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,238
Crime and gruesomeness

123
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:54,000
We are just like barbarians.

124
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:08,969
What's the hell?

125
00:12:10,561 --> 00:12:11,613
Are you Mr.Gomu?

126
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:14,520
I respect you.

127
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,375
The public knows that I only write the truth,

128
00:12:20,175 --> 00:12:21,840
and I will continue to write the truth.

129
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,986
I just want some free time

130
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,456
There's no point in receiving royalties

131
00:12:26,494 --> 00:12:28,032
There's no point because I don't have time to spend money

132
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,318
Money is like a flower

133
00:12:30,395 --> 00:12:31,942
Don't you have anything else I can eat?

134
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:32,693
Beer.

135
00:12:34,032 --> 00:12:36,496
I don't need beer I want something with chicken

136
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,986
Apparently there's only roast chicken

137
00:12:38,011 --> 00:12:39,795
That's a good thing

138
00:12:40,029 --> 00:12:42,573
Please eat a lot.

139
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:43,894
Roast chiken.

140
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:47,175
How about a story about a beautiful pickpocket girl?

141
00:12:47,246 --> 00:12:48,320
 beautiful pickpocket girl?

142
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:55,654
That's an old fashion.

143
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,465
No one wanna read about that.

144
00:12:58,225 --> 00:13:00,335
There's no beautiful pickpocket girl.

145
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,046
If she's beautiful, she does not do pickpocket.

146
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,176
She can live a cool, flashy life.

147
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:07,915
If there is a pickpocket girl,

148
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:12,290
First of all,she must be the clumsy old ladies who have realised they can make money by their face.

149
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:18,383
Excuse me for asking, but you're the one with the prejudices

150
00:13:19,862 --> 00:13:22,142
I mean prejudice is the cause of war

151
00:13:25,825 --> 00:13:27,025
You're the one with the prejudices

152
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:28,636
Don't get involved with him.

153
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:29,842
There's a beautiful pickpocket girl.

154
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,035
That's an old story

155
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:32,036
There's.

156
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:34,856
I want to meet her.

157
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,459
I'll let you.

158
00:13:35,546 --> 00:13:36,272
Where is she?

159
00:13:36,499 --> 00:13:37,345
Osaka

160
00:13:38,075 --> 00:13:42,212
Osaka? I was in Osaka until this morning but I didn't see her.

161
00:13:42,725 --> 00:13:45,725
Maybe she's boarding on this train.

162
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,539
That woman is a vehicle specialist

163
00:13:47,724 --> 00:13:49,724
Is she on this train?
That's scary.

164
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,620
I'm just saying maybe

165
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,414
pickpocket, thieves, robbers, murderers, they're everywhere, with us

166
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,148
This guy is too serious, you're single too, right?

167
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,441
He's too.

168
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,661
Single men have no sense of surveillance over women

169
00:14:10,241 --> 00:14:11,526
Even if you say arrogant things,

170
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,602
Deep down, you look into her eyes and admire her.

171
00:14:14,213 --> 00:14:19,172
I think a woman who wears false eyelashes, high shadow, and has curves is beautiful

172
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,312
It's normal for young women to have curves

173
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:27,040
But she is the most unfaithful woman I have ever met in my life

174
00:14:27,211 --> 00:14:28,025
I can't trust you.

175
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,631
Please believe in me

176
00:14:30,188 --> 00:14:33,381
Believe in you?I don't know you

177
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,107
Yes, it's dirty.

178
00:15:35,345 --> 00:15:38,245
Sorry, it's fine

179
00:15:41,142 --> 00:15:42,456
Is this yours?

180
00:15:52,246 --> 00:15:53,961
May I smoke?

181
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:55,662
Go ahead.

182
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,428
I’m sorry.

183
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:14,740
No, it's fine, I'll get used to it quickly. It smells really good

184
00:16:15,259 --> 00:16:19,034
You're kind.
Traveling with someine is fun.

185
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,644
It's so fun to be with someone as beautiful and kind as you

186
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,532
Where are you going?

187
00:16:27,123 --> 00:16:28,143
I'll give my my business card.

188
00:16:45,022 --> 00:16:48,022
I would love to show you around if you come to Tokyo

189
00:16:48,788 --> 00:16:50,281
Thank you very much.

190
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:53,535
How about joining me as a diner?

191
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:54,913
I'm full.

192
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,387
I see.

193
00:16:58,161 --> 00:16:59,681
Excuse me.

194
00:17:11,287 --> 00:17:12,054
Ouch.

195
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:16,656
My stocking is broken.

196
00:17:19,181 --> 00:17:20,214
Wait.

197
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:26,246
Sis.

198
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:28,284
Be careful

199
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,160
it broke again

200
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:31,840
Sorry.

201
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,324
I told you to be careful when kicking
nylon socks because they tear easily

202
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,570
It's just a play to set things off

203
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Why don't you just stumble?
Don't kick

204
00:17:43,179 --> 00:17:45,228
How much do you think these socks cost?

205
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,348
Sorry, sorry, sorry

206
00:17:46,876 --> 00:17:48,633
I'll pay you back by working someday.

207
00:17:48,658 --> 00:17:49,734
so will you work?

208
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,170
Don't do that.

209
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,786
I'm gonna throw you away

210
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:57,155
Please don't.

211
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:04,087
You shouldn't wander around too much.

212
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,859
The Kita-san is here.

213
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:06,770
Really?

214
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,203
He must have been chaseing you.

215
00:18:09,819 --> 00:18:11,156
But how did he know?

216
00:18:12,352 --> 00:18:14,332
If he catch a big one,his monthly salary will increase

217
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:16,312
You are the one?

218
00:18:17,315 --> 00:18:18,106
Of course

219
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:18,904
Really?

220
00:18:20,077 --> 00:18:21,197
Kita-san is in 2nd class?

221
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,581
I think so.

222
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:25,371
Anyway, it's fine, I'll just beat him

223
00:18:25,692 --> 00:18:26,458
What do you mean?

224
00:18:28,922 --> 00:18:29,522
Sis

225
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:31,378
 you're so noisy

226
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,004
This is my business.

227
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,446
This trip is not just a trip

228
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,446
You told me to tread carefully

229
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:42,470
If we miss something so impressive, what will we do to the humiliation of the pickpocket?

230
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,470
Let's see.

231
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,364
Big sister, try turning off that switch.

232
00:18:53,976 --> 00:18:55,803
I'm not good with scientific things.

233
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:06,524
No matter what anyone says, it's a stupid job

234
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:08,480
You'll understand our work if you try it yourself

235
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,967
Even if we arrest people, crimes just keep coming one after another

236
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:17,110
Laws are necessary. Justice must be done

237
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,920
However, we have reached a point where the police alone cannot do anything about it

238
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,898
It's boring.
It just makes us tired.

239
00:19:25,478 --> 00:19:27,654
Are you going to Tokyo for work?

240
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:28,256
here's no point in complaining,

241
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:31,908
so I drive there every day like a horse and carriage

242
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,076
My boss told me to take my accumulated vacation days,

243
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:37,276
so I have no choice but to take vacations.

244
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,090
My colleagues are in trouble

245
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:40,663
We are short on manpower.

246
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,405
Our boss says

247
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,106
the rules are the rules

248
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:48,069
It's strange, because even if I get a vacation, I don't have any money

249
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,353
All we can get a free train pass.

250
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:57,703
I was thinking about going to Tokyo and checking out the International Beauty Contest

251
00:19:59,299 --> 00:20:01,312
I want to quit Police

252
00:20:02,038 --> 00:20:03,378
The publishers are doing well?

253
00:20:03,491 --> 00:20:04,798
That's not ture.

254
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:09,030
He is on vacation

255
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,498
Why don't you ask him about something? He's  an expert,

256
00:20:12,617 --> 00:20:14,853
so I'm sure he has some interesting material.

257
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,185
I'm not a writer who can't write without a model

258
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,049
You're being quite arrogant

259
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,559
Who's this guy?

260
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:31,073
Oh really

261
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,579
I'm very sorry

262
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,496
Your novel is very popular among us.

263
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,693
Especially First novel.

264
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:37,820
Stop it....

265
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:44,208
I didn't notice you because you changed your hair.

266
00:20:44,879 --> 00:20:47,325
Your hair grows pretty fast

267
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,956
If you're a police officer, you can read,right?

268
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,656
Calm down and take a good look.

269
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,590
I'm not trash(Gomi)

270
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:53,617
I'm Gomi.

271
00:20:54,195 --> 00:20:57,205
Many people get my name wrong.

272
00:20:57,598 --> 00:20:59,524
I'm sure you guys call me gomi.

273
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:09,136
Oh, you've already done it.

274
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,910
 It's very crowded

275
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:14,833
Even if I extend it for an hour or two, I won't die,

276
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:16,899
You're funny.

277
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:19,632
Is it me? Is that so?

278
00:21:30,277 --> 00:21:31,271
Hey you.

279
00:21:33,394 --> 00:21:33,921
Me?

280
00:21:35,524 --> 00:21:36,344
I’m sorry.

281
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:37,968
I'll pick it up.

282
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,776
I don't know who is he but

283
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,746
Let him to pick it up.

284
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:59,136
I'm very sorry Madam,

285
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:03,112
you shouldn't say rude things.

286
00:22:03,253 --> 00:22:04,833
Do you think this person is a wife?

287
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:06,961
Do you think she is my wife?

288
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:11,145
I’m sorry.

289
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:18,498
He's so rude.

290
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,148
He's bad novelist.

291
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,957
What are you doing?

292
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,750
What's wrong?

293
00:22:41,387 --> 00:22:42,711
Someone is here.

294
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:43,851
Oh.

295
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:14,885
this train is moden, right?

296
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:18,784
Please wait a moment, I'll have to blame it on a telegram before departure

297
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:23,129
I'm not talking about telegrams.
I'm talking about lights.

298
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,935
Isn't that supposed to be the case.

299
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,086
That's automatic

300
00:23:28,795 --> 00:23:30,648
You have to work.

301
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,402
I'll check it out later.

302
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,136
You can't say it like that

303
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,896
Why don't you just say sorry?

304
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,656
I'mletting you know

305
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,878
I'm sorry

306
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:44,457
It suddenly becomes dark and surprising

307
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:48,047
It is too late to act after a robbery.

308
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,516
Was there a theft?

309
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,017
that was a big problem

310
00:23:50,064 --> 00:23:51,430
I mean if it's happened.

311
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,721
It's a great opportunity for pickpockets

312
00:23:52,986 --> 00:23:53,998
Were there any pickpockets?

313
00:23:54,023 --> 00:23:55,846
I don't know if you asked me

314
00:24:25,034 --> 00:24:25,700
My walltet is missing

315
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:26,420
What was that?

316
00:24:26,527 --> 00:24:27,274
Were there any pickpockets?

317
00:24:27,393 --> 00:24:28,457
My wallet was stolen

318
00:24:28,482 --> 00:24:30,724
That's what I said.

319
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,956
That kind of young, decent guy is a suspicious idea

320
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,015
Modern pickpockets are well-dressed.

321
00:24:37,417 --> 00:24:40,136
Anyway, please come in.

322
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,796
Is there something wrong?

323
00:24:42,826 --> 00:24:44,203
My wallet was stolen.

324
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,822
Don't tell him.

325
00:24:47,016 --> 00:24:48,349
What was stolen.

326
00:24:48,389 --> 00:24:51,389
She swapped it with my wallet

327
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:53,028
Don't tell him.

328
00:24:53,788 --> 00:24:55,054
It's a bit tricky.

329
00:24:56,082 --> 00:24:57,089
But.

330
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:02,679
Excuse me, customer, but please come in for a moment

331
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,840
I'm in trouble because there is no public police today

332
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:10,314
But I'm on vacation.

333
00:25:10,339 --> 00:25:11,585
Let me go!

334
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:13,910
You're the thief,right?

335
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:16,750
You're the pickpocket and yet you are on vacation.

336
00:25:16,887 --> 00:25:18,267
Who?

337
00:25:18,736 --> 00:25:19,749
Don't do that.

338
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,806
Although there is no clear evidence

339
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,194
Even if you say that

340
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:23,275
Calm down.

341
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,256
what are you doing?

342
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:25,403
The pickpocket is a woman

343
00:25:25,516 --> 00:25:26,189
A woman?

344
00:25:26,384 --> 00:25:27,357
Do you have any idea?

345
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:28,251
Who are you?

346
00:25:31,714 --> 00:25:32,514
Thank you

347
00:25:32,909 --> 00:25:35,155
I'm sorry, but please listen to this person

348
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,810
I'm on vacation

349
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:40,078
This is not my jurisdiction.
Sorry

350
00:25:42,753 --> 00:25:44,129
Did she sit next to you?

351
00:25:44,531 --> 00:25:44,977
Yes.

352
00:25:45,341 --> 00:25:46,220
Did she hug you?

353
00:25:46,446 --> 00:25:47,112
Yes.

354
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:49,667
You did a good job

355
00:25:49,957 --> 00:25:50,904
What kind of woman was she?

356
00:25:51,006 --> 00:25:51,922
She was beautiful

357
00:25:54,198 --> 00:25:56,775
Did she have a different Japanese personality?

358
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,045
She was 25-6 years old, 1 meter 60 cm tall, and has big eyes

359
00:26:01,123 --> 00:26:02,090
Nice leg.

360
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,307
Damn it.
She was on this train.

361
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:08,017
It can't be helped.

362
00:26:08,649 --> 00:26:10,885
She is a pickpocket within my jurisdiction.

363
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,520
I'll take care of this case

364
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,326
Thank you.

365
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:15,650
She is popular in Osaka
You thought she was a beautiful woman?

366
00:26:16,223 --> 00:26:17,270
I'm a feminist

367
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,904
I'm not asking about you.

368
00:26:19,229 --> 00:26:20,829
She was a beautiful woman.

369
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,879
Thank you very much.

370
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:27,340
My wallet is in here.

371
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:30,041
the business card holder was stolen.

372
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,206
There was something important in there?

373
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,355
No, it's just a business card.

374
00:26:32,379 --> 00:26:33,744
That's not true, right?

375
00:26:34,038 --> 00:26:35,598
She won't get it wrong.

376
00:26:35,796 --> 00:26:37,621
Oh, customer, 1st class is here.

377
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:57,982
Oh, excuse me

378
00:27:08,097 --> 00:27:09,490
What's wrong?

379
00:27:10,076 --> 00:27:11,362
I'm so sorry

380
00:27:12,049 --> 00:27:13,482
What can I do for you?

381
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:15,070
Something must have gone wrong

382
00:27:15,587 --> 00:27:16,770
Please don't make fun of me.

383
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,283
I'm sorry

384
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,321
You're great.

385
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:34,534
What?

386
00:27:35,013 --> 00:27:36,648
You stole it

387
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:37,659
Don't get me wrong.

388
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:39,491
I'm just taking care of this.

389
00:27:40,535 --> 00:27:41,335
She's my sis.

390
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:42,556
I know.

391
00:27:55,317 --> 00:27:56,676
I'm sorry .

392
00:28:15,063 --> 00:28:15,943
Hello

393
00:28:16,203 --> 00:28:17,143
Hello.

394
00:28:19,142 --> 00:28:21,635
what a coincidence to meet you here

395
00:28:21,926 --> 00:28:23,245
What a coincidence.

396
00:28:25,931 --> 00:28:27,085
You worked in first class.

397
00:28:27,602 --> 00:28:28,482
There's no point in talking about anything.

398
00:28:28,516 --> 00:28:30,016
Don't pretend you don't know.

399
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,906
You're probably the only one who did it.

400
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:33,905
What do you mean?

401
00:28:34,698 --> 00:28:35,991
Young and tall

402
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:40,105
beautiful woman with big eyes and beautiful legs

403
00:28:40,763 --> 00:28:41,744
Not really,

404
00:28:42,071 --> 00:28:43,285
Come.

405
00:28:44,117 --> 00:28:46,317
That's wrong way

406
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,486
I'm not going  first class

407
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,750
I've been in second class the whole time,

408
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:51,358
 let me see your ticket

409
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,870
Oh, I put that in my suitcase and left it on the seat

410
00:28:55,466 --> 00:28:56,600
That's suspicious

411
00:29:01,094 --> 00:29:02,101
Police.

412
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:04,482
Did you see me pickpocket?

413
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:05,376
No.

414
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,565
So you're going to do a physical examination?

415
00:29:09,725 --> 00:29:10,418
No.

416
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:14,535
You are talking nonsense here.
Let me go!

417
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,252
But.

418
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:22,588
Ouch.

419
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,330
I got hurt.

420
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,294
Why you chase me?

421
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:31,534
Don't say bullshit.

422
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,966
I'm going to Tokyo

423
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:37,108
You just happened to be the one who got me

424
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,677
I have a destination in mind too

425
00:29:41,295 --> 00:29:42,846
Where are you going on this journey?

426
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,029
I'm going back to my hometown.

427
00:29:44,338 --> 00:29:47,490
Your home is Atsugi in Kanagawa Prefecture,right?

428
00:29:47,693 --> 00:29:48,295
Yes.

429
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:49,350
For what?

430
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,708
It's none of your business.

431
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,560
You went to Osaka when you were three years old.

432
00:29:57,987 --> 00:30:00,987
Your father died early. your mother also died when you are thirteen

433
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:05,210
But you're not the only one without parents

434
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,060
Are you not going to do any serious work?

435
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:14,919
You don't have to do anything bad

436
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,209
Don't get too cocky just because you checked your family register

437
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:21,377
Did you see our hardships written in our family register?

438
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:24,396
so we have our hardships

439
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,810
Is everyone suspected of being a spy?

440
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:28,974
The spy ?

441
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:32,654
My father committed suicide

442
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:35,811
My mother died from overwork.

443
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,732
That's what he kept saying until the moment he died

444
00:30:40,298 --> 00:30:43,298
They asked me to avenge them.

445
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,935
I'm gonna knock them down like bang

446
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,826
Who?

447
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,786
Those relatives in Atsugi.

448
00:30:49,615 --> 00:30:50,623
I'll hit them.

449
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,055
You shouldn't do that

450
00:30:52,088 --> 00:30:55,068
I never thought you'd become a murderer
They asked me to avenge them.

451
00:30:56,334 --> 00:30:57,779
Don't do that.

452
00:30:59,996 --> 00:31:01,426
I can't stand it anymore, but if you insist on doing it,

453
00:31:01,794 --> 00:31:04,677
I'll hit them for you.

454
00:31:05,969 --> 00:31:09,295
That's right, I'll do it.

455
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:18,397
I'm not saying kill them.

456
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:20,412
I use dynamite

457
00:31:20,604 --> 00:31:23,903
But dynamite is dangerous,

458
00:31:24,341 --> 00:31:25,482
I'll ldo Memorial service

459
00:31:26,006 --> 00:31:26,545
Memorial service?

460
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,849
I want to show them I have a good life.

461
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:35,865
They called us traitors and drove us out of Atsugi.

462
00:31:36,545 --> 00:31:37,693
By Memorial service?

463
00:31:38,316 --> 00:31:39,732
By lugjurilous Memorial service

464
00:31:39,881 --> 00:31:41,654
Who pay the expence?

465
00:31:42,733 --> 00:31:43,381
I earned.

466
00:31:43,623 --> 00:31:44,334
When?

467
00:31:45,068 --> 00:31:45,920
All the time.

468
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,701
You were in prison less than three months ago.

469
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:49,990
After leaving

470
00:31:50,318 --> 00:31:50,936
Wait.

471
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:52,529
That's bad.

472
00:31:53,709 --> 00:31:55,873
I earned.

473
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:58,154
If you have a complaint, get some evidence first

474
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:04,521
Goodbye, see you again in Osaka

475
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,966
Kita has been following us.

476
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,974
I was worried about whether you and he were together.

477
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:25,779
I met him.

478
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:26,936
Really?

479
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:27,787
Let's leave

480
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,990
Don't worry.

481
00:32:31,313 --> 00:32:34,201
Please don't stay near me.

482
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,092
We are mate.

483
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:41,865
You're just helping me..
I don't want you to be a criminal.

484
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,068
Because there's hope for you

485
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,029
But

486
00:32:45,272 --> 00:32:46,272
But?

487
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,490
You are not the kind of person who would pickpocket someone.

488
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:51,794
You look shocked all year round and so clumsy.

489
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:57,544
The only thing you took just now was a business card.

490
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,615
Because it's a business card holder

491
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,248
You will go to a memorial service

492
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,506
Please don't let the money for the memorial service stolen.

493
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,693
I just mistook the right and left pockets.

494
00:33:09,217 --> 00:33:10,959
I'm still skillful.

495
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:17,849
the next car is 2nd class.

496
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,966
so please make sure you find your seat carefully this time

497
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:23,186
A train boy will be in that car too,

498
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,210
so please ask him to guide you

499
00:33:30,867 --> 00:33:32,982
May I help you, grandma?

500
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,045
That's a lot of work

501
00:33:35,115 --> 00:33:37,193
Thanks.

502
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:40,365
You're so kind.

503
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,091
What's wrong?

504
00:33:46,537 --> 00:33:52,897
I can't enter the first class carriage because of my dirty clothes.

505
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:58,271
It looks similar to this, but it's a little different on this tiny piece of paper

506
00:33:59,441 --> 00:34:01,732
This is for 1st class.

507
00:34:01,896 --> 00:34:03,451
He misread it.

508
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:04,576
It's impossible.

509
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:06,584
I definitely have a second class ticket.

510
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:10,715
When they checked it, they mixed it up with the
other tickets and gave it back to me, right?

511
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:13,146
You proudly returned to 1st classcar with this ticket in hand

512
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:17,748
Thank you very much.

513
00:34:18,703 --> 00:34:22,863
A soft chair is better for the elderly.

514
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:32,794
You are very kind.

515
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:37,826
You are so lucky to have such a wonderful wife

516
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,576
Is she my wife?

517
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:43,695
You are lovely couple

518
00:34:44,024 --> 00:34:46,654
Bring her luggage to her seat

519
00:34:46,873 --> 00:34:47,967
Don't say bullshit.

520
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,388
Thank you very much.

521
00:34:51,888 --> 00:34:59,248
I never thought that there would be someone as kind as you
guys, even among the young people.

522
00:34:59,951 --> 00:35:01,951
I'm glad.

523
00:35:06,975 --> 00:35:09,082
Come on, take her away quickly.

524
00:35:10,404 --> 00:35:13,295
Please take care of my luggugue.

525
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:36,951
telegram information.

526
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,240
To Mr. Tanaka : A telegram has arrived for Mr. Tanaka

527
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:45,590
Please inform the crew

528
00:35:47,701 --> 00:35:49,795
Thank you very much.

529
00:35:53,576 --> 00:35:54,045
Hi

530
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:55,443
Oh you.

531
00:35:57,646 --> 00:35:59,755
She was not here.

532
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:01,628
Yes.

533
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,100
I see.
Damn it.

534
00:36:08,552 --> 00:36:11,552
Where were you from?

535
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,912
What are you doing?

536
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,856
All I'm saying is

537
00:36:22,887 --> 00:36:26,137
Now that I'm almost at the end of my trip between Osaka and Tokyo,

538
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,794
what are you even saying now?

539
00:36:32,053 --> 00:36:32,920
Get out.

540
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:35,100
where have you been all this time?

541
00:36:35,147 --> 00:36:36,139
It's none of your business.

542
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,380
Why don't you go back to your seat? It's my seat

543
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:40,443
Do you have the ticket?

544
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,435
Of course,

545
00:36:41,694 --> 00:36:42,216
let me see it

546
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,940
Car No. 11, No. 17, I'm the same.

547
00:36:51,506 --> 00:36:54,053
Oh yeah same.

548
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:58,386
It says eleventh

549
00:36:58,411 --> 00:37:00,154
It's none of your business.

550
00:37:03,604 --> 00:37:05,037
does it look like eleven?

551
00:37:05,482 --> 00:37:06,600
this number is eleven.

552
00:37:07,185 --> 00:37:09,536
11 is here
It's always vacant.

553
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,123
Thank you, my seat is over there. The one at the front desk is...

554
00:37:18,405 --> 00:37:21,595
There is a problem with their writing.

555
00:37:22,613 --> 00:37:25,485
but I'm a person who follows the rules

556
00:37:27,661 --> 00:37:29,493
Here you go.

557
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,720
It's your suitcase.

558
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:36,871
So She is your sister

559
00:37:37,151 --> 00:37:38,634
No, that's not true.

560
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,720
I don't know him.

561
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,978
Are you still going to complain?

562
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:45,752
 Sorry

563
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:50,170
Then I'll borrow this book. I'll return you back.

564
00:37:58,148 --> 00:37:59,814
What are you muttering about?

565
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,689
That person took my book.

566
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,986
What a strange person

567
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:05,996
He's also constantly bothering you.

568
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,095
Ah, I know that. he wanted to talk to me forever

569
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:11,181
Why?

570
00:38:11,688 --> 00:38:14,393
Because I'm pretty,

571
00:38:17,236 --> 00:38:18,572
but
it's just a coincidence

572
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:22,009
The ticket you stole from that old lady was for the seat next to me

573
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:26,291
Did you see me pickpocketing?

574
00:38:26,642 --> 00:38:28,294
No at all.

575
00:38:29,561 --> 00:38:30,907
It was a small thing.

576
00:38:30,963 --> 00:38:32,072
 It was wonderful

577
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,767
He's back again

578
00:38:54,767 --> 00:38:56,158
Don't be so familiar.

579
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,501
I have a ticket,

580
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:03,259
2nd class.

581
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,829
I don't approve of women who are clumsy with their hands

582
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:17,993
In that sense, I like you.

583
00:39:19,478 --> 00:39:22,298
You will be good at sewing in no time.

584
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:24,267
Will you marry me?

585
00:39:25,175 --> 00:39:28,360
I'm telling you, why don't
you change your business?

586
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:32,423
I can introduce you to a job

587
00:39:33,532 --> 00:39:36,000
It's a waste to spend the money

588
00:39:36,025 --> 00:39:37,657
It's a waste to spend money on memorial services

589
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:40,884
Why don't you use the money to fund your store someday?

590
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,423
I'll do memorial services.

591
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:44,283
Think carefully about it.

592
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,615
Reviewing things doesn't resonate with modern people at all

593
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,046
That makes sense to me

594
00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:52,766
And the method is old-fashioned.

595
00:39:52,821 --> 00:39:55,821
Doing this will make your chest feel refreshed.

596
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,743
Legal matters are boring

597
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:00,768
I will give them a great treat

598
00:40:00,808 --> 00:40:03,821
There's no need to treat your enemy to a feast

599
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,456
The world is all about profit and loss, so to speak

600
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,696
You should be kind to the old lady,right?

601
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:12,165
No, it's just because I feel sorry for her.

602
00:40:13,306 --> 00:40:14,048
I see.

603
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:16,775
That's why I think it's boring being police.

604
00:40:17,930 --> 00:40:20,930
I'm trying to bring you back into normal society.

605
00:40:21,896 --> 00:40:23,407
But you don't accept it.

606
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:29,730
We can't catch a pickpocket unless you catch him red-handed

607
00:40:30,837 --> 00:40:35,571
There is a pickpocket right in front of me, but she is making fun of me.

608
00:40:35,978 --> 00:40:37,666
I’m sorry.

609
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:46,759
I have nothing else to do since it's my vacation anyway, so I'll walk by your side forever

610
00:40:47,502 --> 00:40:49,376
There's a chance,

611
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,095
Don't do that.

612
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:54,390
I'd be in trouble if you come.

613
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,392
It's okay, I'm wearing casual clothes, so I'm your lover

614
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:03,438
Please get out.

615
00:41:21,752 --> 00:41:23,158
I dropped.

616
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:27,580
I can't see it. Where did it go?

617
00:41:27,605 --> 00:41:28,463
How much is it?

618
00:41:28,634 --> 00:41:30,064
 Is it a 100 yen coin?

619
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,564
I'll find it.

620
00:41:32,345 --> 00:41:33,595
Never mind.

621
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:34,947
It's waste.

622
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,955
She'run away.

623
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,532
What's wrong?

624
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:02,463
She.

625
00:42:02,517 --> 00:42:03,533
Train is leaving soon.

626
00:42:03,558 --> 00:42:04,259
I know

627
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:05,338
You'll miss it

628
00:42:05,363 --> 00:42:06,610
it can't be helped.

629
00:42:23,486 --> 00:42:24,619
Be careful.

630
00:42:56,494 --> 00:43:00,095
Where's my wallet?

631
00:43:03,423 --> 00:43:04,728
Damn it.

632
00:43:07,072 --> 00:43:09,265
She picjocketed.

633
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:20,009
I am happy to see Haruko-chan again after such a long time

634
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:26,892
You've grown so much,, and Hashiru has grown a lot too.

635
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,150
You were still so cute when I picked you up.

636
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:33,634
How is The economy in Osaka?

637
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:34,807
It has been really bad lately.

638
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,361
How are chikako and others.

639
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:40,189
They live in different places.

640
00:45:41,695 --> 00:45:43,908
so it's not a business that has been around for a long time.

641
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:46,697
I'm going to quit too

642
00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:49,072
It's so noisy.

643
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:50,994
Outside?

644
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,822
Isn't it bad?

645
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:54,025
Is that real?

646
00:45:54,525 --> 00:45:55,681
Of course,

647
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,080
that's a waste.

648
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,634
Thanks to that being so careful

649
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,120
I'm can sleep well listening to this sound

650
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,590
It's a terminal symptom of capitalist society.

651
00:46:08,490 --> 00:46:10,816
So now it's time for going to Atsugi?

652
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:11,846
If the world like this

653
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:14,676
So I thought it would be better to do it quickly when I said what I wanted to do

654
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,275
My sister watches a lot of TV

655
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,776
so she knows a lot about world affairs

656
00:46:18,370 --> 00:46:20,330
Even though they had been so cared for by my father,

657
00:46:20,355 --> 00:46:23,355
They told the Military Police.

658
00:46:24,146 --> 00:46:25,992
that's just how the world is

659
00:46:26,572 --> 00:46:28,033
They repay kindness with evil

660
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,821
How much did you bring?

661
00:46:30,127 --> 00:46:31,057
30000.

662
00:46:32,210 --> 00:46:33,736
It was hard to make all that

663
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,734
If my sister have a little extra money, she just buy handbags

664
00:46:37,759 --> 00:46:40,539
clothes and treat us ramen.

665
00:46:40,564 --> 00:46:42,430
So, you're acting weird.
Don't call her sis

666
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:44,025
It's cute

667
00:46:44,454 --> 00:46:46,978
Him?
What are you talking about?

668
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:48,869
This boy has an ideal.

669
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:50,469
I want to become a ramen noodle coock.

670
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:52,281
He coock nce.

671
00:46:52,884 --> 00:46:55,814
The owner of the ramen shop offered to give me the rights to the shop.

672
00:46:56,191 --> 00:46:58,720
Where is that money? Let me see around

673
00:46:58,885 --> 00:47:00,103
Go to kichen.

674
00:47:04,779 --> 00:47:06,517
I can buy it for 30,000 yen

675
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:09,447
Are you guys still upstairs in Kamaboko shop?

676
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,268
I'm the only one.

677
00:47:10,307 --> 00:47:10,908
How's Saya?

678
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,830
She moved to the second floor of the local greengrocer.

679
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,689
She hates me because I've become manly, but I'm lonely

680
00:47:28,674 --> 00:47:29,603
Saya.

681
00:47:31,822 --> 00:47:34,260
That old woman did it.

682
00:47:34,626 --> 00:47:36,056
She pickpocketed.

683
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:38,205
It was stolen. Your money was taken?

684
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,205
That old woman pickpockted her Cost of legal services

685
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:42,038
I told you off.

686
00:47:42,127 --> 00:47:43,971
She acted weird.

687
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:49,145
Don't cry.
She is the one who wants to cry

688
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:55,770
There are some nasty people out there who take other people's money

689
00:47:57,463 --> 00:47:59,438
People have bad heart.

690
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,783
Recently, a newspaper article said that a man who was robbed of his company's money committed suicide

691
00:48:08,027 --> 00:48:09,533
That's how I feel,

692
00:48:10,361 --> 00:48:12,869
but isn't it okay to not die?

693
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:32,501
Be careful.

694
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:39,259
I won't stop you from committing suicide

695
00:48:40,316 --> 00:48:44,548
Why don't you hang out for a night? Won't you come and play with me?

696
00:48:49,697 --> 00:48:53,377
Who said I was going to die? If you say something weird, I'll call the cops

697
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:33,271
Hello? Hello?

698
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,549
What's wrong?

699
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:36,619
Why won't you let me die? Please, let me die

700
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:39,548
Don't say stupid things

701
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,860
Ah,I met you on train.

702
00:50:59,134 --> 00:51:03,042
Insurance saleswomen are underpaid

703
00:51:04,363 --> 00:51:06,462
But I don't feel like doing anything weird

704
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:10,710
there's a person like you with a strict sense of ethics..

705
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,392
That's unusual

706
00:51:13,910 --> 00:51:18,322
I came back without having anything to eat and saving up my money

707
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:24,939
I've also felt stuck lately

708
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:28,306
Nothing comes from crime and eroticism

709
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:32,571
It's time to change my way. Your story is truly inspiring

710
00:51:33,650 --> 00:51:35,978
Could you please give me more details?

711
00:51:37,713 --> 00:51:38,830
That was all.

712
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,730
Don't say all those cold things like that

713
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,595
You have to help me

714
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:48,050
I believe that I am the man with the mission to
bring new morality and soil to this troubled Japan

715
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:53,892
I just made up my mind, so this is who I am

716
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,776
You know that

717
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:59,408
My name is often mistaken

718
00:52:03,572 --> 00:52:05,447
Person who name Gomi is also writer?

719
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,764
Excuse me for a moment

720
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:11,996
Please wait a moment

721
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,020
Don't take it easy, you are tired,

722
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:17,938
this is a home where you don't have to worry at all

723
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,970
It's an inn where I use instructions for work

724
00:52:21,270 --> 00:52:24,270
But thank you for all your help

725
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:30,072
I have no choice but to give it to you the money.

726
00:52:30,307 --> 00:52:31,658
I don't mind the money.

727
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:33,478
I can't ask you.

728
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,190
how much did she steal?

729
00:52:36,283 --> 00:52:37,127
100,000 yen

730
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:38,682
100,000 yen?

731
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,115
Isn't that a lot?

732
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:43,158
Why didn't you report it to the police?

733
00:52:43,835 --> 00:52:46,451
She wouldn't be so stupid as to just go and give the money back to the police

734
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:49,705
I'm sure you won't get your money back if you report it to the police,

735
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:52,716
but I think it's embarrassing to be scammed, so I'd rather not go to the police

736
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:54,040
I would rather die

737
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:56,478
That's the great thing about you

738
00:52:57,521 --> 00:52:59,923
The spirit of blaming yourself first before blaming anyone else

739
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,306
I want to hear about all of that

740
00:53:02,455 --> 00:53:03,807
I can pay you 70000yen

741
00:53:04,777 --> 00:53:06,408
Could you give me 70,000 yen?

742
00:53:08,408 --> 00:53:09,385
Thank you

743
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,650
You're so honest, aren't you? Do you want to take a bath? Let's get together

744
00:53:26,396 --> 00:53:27,564
Can we go in together?

745
00:53:27,849 --> 00:53:28,908
Yes, please.

746
00:53:40,316 --> 00:53:41,775
Have you finish yet?

747
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,220
I felt very good.

748
00:53:45,579 --> 00:53:47,478
but please take it easy

749
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:07,634
Takahashi..shiranami..

750
00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:10,072
These are too old.

751
00:54:10,970 --> 00:54:15,970
I thought school teachers weren't that great.
I don't have to stay here long.

752
00:54:22,663 --> 00:54:24,431
why you're wearing clothes?

753
00:54:25,768 --> 00:54:26,916
Have you finished?

754
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:28,861
I am taking a bath just for a while.

755
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:32,119
It's quick, but if I am alone.

756
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,462
It is a cheap thing if I think about saving one life

757
00:54:50,134 --> 00:54:53,540
Sorry, now I can show my gratitude to my parents

758
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:57,915
I just received an advance for a magazine article.

759
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:00,220
Are you novelist?

760
00:55:00,447 --> 00:55:01,455
What do you mean?

761
00:55:02,963 --> 00:55:05,838
You've been misunderstanding me all this time

762
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:10,658
I'm sure you'll be tired tonight, so maybe I'll listen to you talk while you sleep

763
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,255
What are you doing?

764
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:15,338
Thank you teacher

765
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,314
I will never forget this

766
00:55:18,705 --> 00:55:21,431
I don't feel like forcing yourself to sleep

767
00:55:21,688 --> 00:55:24,212
You should have at least told me your story

768
00:55:29,369 --> 00:55:32,197
That's too bad.

769
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:37,962
Isn't this a terrible world?

770
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:42,142
The modern world is full of crime.

771
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:15,939
I went back to my sister's room in the apartment and slept properly,

772
00:57:16,243 --> 00:57:18,908
You came back so pretty late, I know that.

773
00:57:20,447 --> 00:57:21,408
I didn't know.

774
00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:23,646
you fall asleep as soon as I eat udon,

775
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:25,361
you snore, you break your teeth,

776
00:57:25,447 --> 00:57:27,158
I didn't do anything.

777
00:57:27,548 --> 00:57:30,266
Who would give you 70,000 yen without doing anything?

778
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:31,736
I was just taking a bath.

779
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:32,369
See?

780
00:57:32,486 --> 00:57:33,611
I took alone

781
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:39,783
it seems you didn't keep what I said after all.

782
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,470
You don't remember when I left Osaka three years ago?

783
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,596
There are many type of pickpocket.

784
00:57:53,681 --> 00:57:57,453
You shouldn't use your body to make money

785
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:01,106
If you make a mistake

786
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:04,130
Your dead parents feel sad about you.

787
00:58:05,978 --> 00:58:08,978
The pickpocket is the one who leaves before the street is the best

788
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:12,530
The secret to pickpocketing is to avoid even touching the thier body

789
00:58:12,870 --> 00:58:16,298
I don't have the skill to do that. I guess I just have to settle for shoplifting

790
00:58:17,048 --> 00:58:18,855
But I haven't soiled my body

791
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:21,688
Your were about getting
naked in front of a guy.

792
00:58:21,736 --> 00:58:22,893
Sorry to interrupt your conversation.

793
00:58:23,314 --> 00:58:25,142
It's so hot I'm going to get a sunstroke

794
00:58:25,870 --> 00:58:27,267
Can I rest in the shade over there?

795
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:28,025
No

796
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,286
We have to find our home.

797
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:33,322
Your hometown is here,no?

798
00:58:33,347 --> 00:58:33,916
Yes.

799
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,234
If so, it's here

800
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:40,186
Big sister, stay strong

801
00:58:40,210 --> 00:58:42,426
We got on and off many trains from early in the morning

802
00:58:42,450 --> 00:58:43,869
and finally made it here

803
00:58:47,930 --> 00:58:50,930
There's no way a place like this is my hometown

804
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,850
There's nothing there but planes flying around

805
00:58:56,780 --> 00:58:59,780
The village of Kiyose in Atsugi

806
00:58:59,849 --> 00:59:02,805
There is a beautiful little river flowing there.

807
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,626
There are small settlements there.

808
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:08,470
My mother always said that.

809
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,376
When I think back on that time, I feel very nostalgic.

810
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,065
There was no airfield?

811
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,275
I knew there was a naval airfield
called Shimizu Airfield nearby.

812
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:25,280
You don't know anything, big sister?

813
00:59:25,564 --> 00:59:28,423
Yeah, I was kicked out when I was a baby.

814
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,548
In twenty-four or twenty-five years

815
00:59:30,661 --> 00:59:32,986
things probably change a bit.

816
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,251
Well....

817
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:03,800
We moved here four years ago

818
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:05,698
We don't know about the old days.

819
01:00:06,515 --> 01:00:09,807
When we came here, the ecconomy were ridiculously good

820
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,641
Even so, I paid a high royalty fee to buy it,

821
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,065
and now I have no idea what's going on

822
01:00:15,935 --> 01:00:18,190
Because there's nowhere to go now

823
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:20,190
We are in trouble.

824
01:00:21,810 --> 01:00:24,716
If you want,We can rent you a room.

825
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:29,792
Please don't say weird things.

826
01:00:30,167 --> 01:00:31,042
I mean..

827
01:00:31,067 --> 01:00:32,956
I'm sorry for bothering you

828
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,971
Are you her mother?

829
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:41,715
Me? her mother, no way.

830
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:49,385
I'll rent the space in front of the store.

831
01:00:49,417 --> 01:00:50,855
What?

832
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:53,464
Please stay here.

833
01:01:07,962 --> 01:01:09,814
Oh, hello detective.

834
01:01:10,512 --> 01:01:14,821
■That's what I thought.
I knew that if I came to Atsugi, you would definitely come.

835
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:18,206
Sure. If you want to be by my side

836
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:21,230
that badly, come with me. Let's go

837
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:25,110
Just give me your wallet

838
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,620
You know there's not much in my wallet

839
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:33,710
You did it just to annoy me, right? I got into a lot of trouble

840
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:39,040
Last night I asked a friend who works at the Metropolitan Police Department to limit the number of police officers

841
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,406
I borrowed 500 yen today and came here

842
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:43,216
I'm in trouble

843
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,196
I've confessed so much

844
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:47,220
Give it back with the drums that made my heart melt. That's great

845
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:52,010
That old lady, um...

846
01:01:54,430 --> 01:01:57,430
I want to keep this between us, but I was rubbed the same way

847
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:00,966
So if it's true

848
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:03,990
Do you remember the old lady carrying a big furoshiki on the train?

849
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,966
My head hurts

850
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:09,990
But that's not what you came all the way here to do. Too bad

851
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:11,836
How much did they take?

852
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:14,276
I'll lend it to you

853
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:17,300
Well then, goodbye. Hey, I

854
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,376
don't want to bother you. It's today

855
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,136
While I am fighting over my parents' grudges

856
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,096
Everyone is getting in the way, so who is everyone?

857
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,586
Are you going to hold a memorial service? It's not worth reporting

858
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:31,596
I can't find my hometown

859
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:34,620
Look at my hometown, it's just an airport and planes

860
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:39,980
Have you asked anyone? It's weird that you don't know

861
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:45,290
In this case, the quickest way to find out is to ask at the police station

862
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:49,416
I used to work at a police box,

863
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:50,856
and I was required to know everything about the residents

864
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,026
within the designated area

865
01:02:53,050 --> 01:02:55,736
There is no such thing as certainty

866
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,760
I'll go with you. No way. Come on

867
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:20,950
Poor sister

868
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,266
In the end, she was dragged away by the factory workers

869
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:30,290
and it was all her fault

870
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,166
She suffers because she is too soft on men

871
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:36,190
That's what happens when your opponent is a big guy

872
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:40,320
Ha ha ha it's gradually decreasing

873
01:03:48,280 --> 01:03:51,280
In the past, there used to be a lot of birth houses called Shiozawa

874
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:56,750
Do you know where it went after it was transferred?

875
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,400
I didn't record the destination

876
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:03,600
It was originally a naval airfield

877
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:07,400
and has been expanded many times to become the vast airfield it is today

878
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:10,930
Well, it seems that more than one or two villages have disappeared

879
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:14,570
The residents have become numb

880
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:18,120
Well, if there's even one Shioza left, they're relatives

881
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,940
You may know where I'm moving to,

882
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:24,226
but I'd like to ask you a question

883
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:27,250
How do I get to Kyomura? There were a lot of people there today

884
01:04:34,130 --> 01:04:37,130
Oh dear, don't be so scared of famous people

885
01:04:42,090 --> 01:04:43,926
I don't know what famous people think about me

886
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:46,950
Did you do something, girl? Play with me, teacher

887
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:53,376
Who are you? We were somewhere

888
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:56,400
That's right, I'm sorry, I'm a detective from Osaka

889
01:04:59,790 --> 01:05:02,790
No, I know this detective. Ah,

890
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,300
this woman wanted to introduce me to a beautiful soup restaurant in Osaka

891
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,980
I'm sorry, I'm an old acquaintance of yours from Osaka

892
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:14,606
It just so happened that I was here

893
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,630
He came with me. He's very kind

894
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,546
There was one enemy in Shiozawa

895
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:27,236
My predecessors had beautiful handwriting and I couldn't read it

896
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:30,260
Excuse me. I'll draw you a map now

897
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:42,010
It's a very confusing place. What happened? Please point out the difference between a man and a woman

898
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:46,626
I don't know how you know me here

899
01:05:46,650 --> 01:05:49,136
I know it's strange to say this in front of her,

900
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:50,666
but people like this are also considered beautiful

901
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:53,426
What do you mean by beautiful woman?

902
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:56,450
Is she as beautiful as this woman? Of course

903
01:05:57,210 --> 01:06:00,210
She's such a beautiful woman. Wait, what a cowardly man

904
01:06:15,270 --> 01:06:18,270
You're not going to do anything until Wednesday

905
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:20,706
because you're jealous of me and her

906
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:23,730
Apparently she couldn't stand the manager and ran away

907
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,520
Please tell me, I really did arrive, I just said I did arrive

908
01:06:29,590 --> 01:06:31,266
She's a beautiful woman who's already been sat on

909
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:34,290
A beautiful pickpocket. A stupid detective

910
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:43,230
That person is a victim of scams. Will fishing be scammed? A relative without compassion

911
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,680
A crystal of hard work and sweat. Of course, it's about money

912
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:57,856
He was so upset that he tried to commit suicide,

913
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,880
but I saved him

914
01:07:01,630 --> 01:07:04,630
Apparently the story is well-known, so I also had my doubts

915
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:06,576
But even now, she's still there

916
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,600
So it's true

917
01:07:12,290 --> 01:07:15,290
that it's true

918
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:23,320
Is your house Mr. Shiozawa? Yes, your house is the only one

919
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:55,696
There's a house called Shiozawa around here that's good

920
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:58,466
My name is Saya Shiozawa

921
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:01,490
Oh, so it's yours? My father is Shiozawa Monnosuke

922
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,680
Do you know him? He used to live around here. We were relatives

923
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,320
Yes, that's right

924
01:08:13,970 --> 01:08:15,576
It used to be quite painful

925
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:18,376
My relatives are also pros in Kiyose Village

926
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Don't you know about Kiyose Village? If my grandfather was alive,

927
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:25,170
he might have known a little about it

928
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:28,370
What was the name of the old man who started last year? He said he was Sugizo

929
01:08:30,610 --> 01:08:33,610
Sugizo is a liberal arts guy, so that's what I thought

930
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,320
This is my relative

931
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:50,046
It's terrible

932
01:08:50,070 --> 01:08:53,070
They're building a golf course and they're telling us to move out

933
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:56,250
I'll try my best to get a good price, so I'll say it

934
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:59,996
Heaven is an adopted child

935
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:02,016
I work on the outskirts of town

936
01:09:02,040 --> 01:09:05,040
He's a smart guy. He's got it all together

937
01:09:05,870 --> 01:09:08,870
But I said I'd go to Tokyo if I got in

938
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,736
Where are you from? Osaka, Osaka

939
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:15,760
Yeah, people who leave early have an advantage

940
01:09:20,540 --> 01:09:23,540
Osaka is a nice place, isn't it? Where did you go? I've looked for you a long time

941
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:35,186
The house and village where I was born was somewhere on that airfield

942
01:10:36,890 --> 01:10:39,890
No one I've asked knows anything about that village

943
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:45,069
It's history, it's the power of history

944
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,842
Even if you didn't take revenge,

945
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:53,600
History has destroyed the village that drove your family out.

946
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:02,920
This is a complete revenge.
It makes me feel good.

947
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:09,764
Could it be worse? I don't have a home town

948
01:11:12,666 --> 01:11:14,561
Oh, stop that airplane noise

949
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:18,600
I want to go to a quiet place

950
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,920
I don't know what to do anymore. Let's go back to Osaka

951
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:32,330
I want to go to prison, it's so quiet there

952
01:11:33,319 --> 01:11:35,514
I miss that place so much now

953
01:11:36,150 --> 01:11:37,835
Have you ever been to prison?

954
01:11:38,409 --> 01:11:40,733
Are you a pickpocket?

955
01:11:40,851 --> 01:11:41,702
Yes.

956
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,140
Shut up

957
01:11:45,690 --> 01:11:48,053
I'll give you back the 70,000 yen because I don't need it anymore

958
01:11:48,257 --> 01:11:49,163
70,000 yen?

959
01:11:49,632 --> 01:11:52,812
Did someone lend you this much money?

960
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:54,694
Take it.

961
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,952
Thanks.

962
01:12:04,747 --> 01:12:06,335
Well then, put me in jail

963
01:12:06,874 --> 01:12:07,741
I can't.

964
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,905
Every human being thinks of their spiritual home

965
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,288
You just found out your hometown has died

966
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,616
And I was shocked to find that your
spiritual home was a prison.

967
01:12:24,796 --> 01:12:26,194
You poor woman.

968
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,530
I just hope I never go to jail again

969
01:12:30,033 --> 01:12:30,647
Bye.

970
01:12:31,655 --> 01:12:34,702
You were trying to get me,right?

971
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:36,515
Wait.

972
01:12:39,952 --> 01:12:40,679
Wait.

973
01:12:41,176 --> 01:12:44,176
I need a beauty pickpocket.

974
01:13:18,756 --> 01:13:20,858
Oh I'm against it to go to police.

975
01:13:21,390 --> 01:13:22,052
Stop here.

976
01:13:22,077 --> 01:13:23,535
If you're going to the police station, please stop the driver

977
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:25,886
If you go to the Metropolitan Police Department, you'll definitely find Kita-san there

978
01:13:25,910 --> 01:13:28,296
It's so cool that you added "Tekanai-san" to it. You like it, don't you?

979
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,320
Kita-san, what are you planning to do after you go to prison? I'm still thinking about it,

980
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:38,436
but I'm not getting anywhere

981
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,926
I won't be young forever either

982
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:43,950
There's no point in getting naked when you're fifty or sixty

983
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:47,260
That's why I always say,

984
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,956
if you hone your skills and you're good at it,

985
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:52,776
First of all, how old is my sister

986
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,800
who doesn't have to pay tax? Leave me alone

987
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:00,690
Even though I look like this, I'm called the Tree Maiden's Spring

988
01:14:01,020 --> 01:14:03,806
It's not as degrading as the color makes it seem

989
01:14:03,830 --> 01:14:05,766
Is that what the first day will be like?

990
01:14:05,790 --> 01:14:08,656
It would be fine if you bought the rights to the ramen on the run

991
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:11,680
Big sister, I'm disappointed

992
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:15,090
For the past 20 years,

993
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:18,016
you've been thinking about revision all the time, awake or asleep

994
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:21,040
That's a lie. I told you the other day that I don't like permanent hair

995
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:25,250
Didn't it remain for ten days? This is the Metropolitan Police Department

996
01:15:02,590 --> 01:15:05,590
Mr. Kita, are you the teacher again? I want you to release Shiosae

997
01:15:07,820 --> 01:15:10,820
Did he get caught? You caught him, right? I didn't see him again

998
01:15:12,020 --> 01:15:15,020
Don't be mean, I really need to be beautiful

999
01:15:16,990 --> 01:15:17,806
The deadline for the magazine is approaching,

1000
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:19,426
but without a girlfriend,

1001
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:22,450
Gomu Kosuke is going to be a model for the sake of his reputation, right?

1002
01:15:23,090 --> 01:15:25,356
Help me, that's right

1003
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,380
You said that you don't need a model to write a novel

1004
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,450
It depends on the time and the situation

1005
01:15:32,990 --> 01:15:35,990
So you're not chasing that woman because you like her?

1006
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:39,126
You're in love with her

1007
01:15:39,150 --> 01:15:41,086
When it comes to who you like

1008
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,110
There is no other way to save such a woman than to become her husband

1009
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,116
That would be a problem

1010
01:15:50,140 --> 01:15:53,140
I'm a police officer who said that if I married her, I'd have to quit being a police officer

1011
01:15:54,430 --> 01:15:57,430
There is no back clause, so that is what actually happens

1012
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:02,206
How can you support her?

1013
01:16:02,230 --> 01:16:04,606
Aren't you already worried about supporting her?

1014
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:07,630
Why is this bad? If you don't give me water,

1015
01:16:09,630 --> 01:16:10,346
then everything is bad

1016
01:16:10,370 --> 01:16:13,370
Modeling a poor woman like you

1017
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,146
Like drinking cheap alcohol in healthy amounts

1018
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:19,766
Isn't it a good thing? You're saying terrible things

1019
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:22,326
I'll get it together

1020
01:16:22,350 --> 01:16:25,350
I don't really know who introduced me to her,

1021
01:16:28,670 --> 01:16:31,356
even though I'd like to talk to her about that house

1022
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:34,380
This side is the one in front of me

1023
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:40,610
Even though I'm in Kanto, I'm tired

1024
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,046
Kanto is Tokaido Fujino White Snow Looking to the west, Chichibu Mountains,

1025
01:16:44,070 --> 01:16:47,070
Kono Plateau, East, Nishitama Water, Musashino Spring

1026
01:16:48,080 --> 01:16:51,080
The following three people grew up listening to the sound of the gold bells

1027
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,146
pounding out of the nearby Choanji temple in the morning and evening

1028
01:16:55,170 --> 01:16:58,096
Please be quiet

1029
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:00,146
It is small and stands in front

1030
01:17:00,170 --> 01:17:02,806
The ceremony of life begins with a small body

1031
01:17:02,830 --> 01:17:05,830
The other person I will be posting is Nao Shiozawa, also known as Onee-chan

1032
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,796
No matter where you are in Izu, you will be able to come

1033
01:17:10,820 --> 01:17:13,820
and join the 500th event for your brother and friends

1034
01:17:14,190 --> 01:17:15,916
I hope you will take this opportunity to make

1035
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,940
a connection with us

1036
01:17:20,950 --> 01:17:23,950
That's impressive. Who did you come to see?

1037
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,396
I knew you were arrested. I didn't know

1038
01:17:29,420 --> 01:17:32,420
I'm a stranger too. I'm a little crazy

1039
01:17:33,170 --> 01:17:36,066
When I told you to match me, you asked me who I was, so I introduced myself

1040
01:17:36,090 --> 01:17:39,090
Catch me please, can't you hear my voice?

1041
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:44,260
If you catch me, that's love

1042
01:17:49,060 --> 01:17:52,060
Yeah, you should definitely do something about it. We're not lovers

1043
01:17:52,290 --> 01:17:55,290
You call me about all those things, yeah, I get it

1044
01:17:58,420 --> 01:18:01,420
Catch me, I'm three, then I must be a little crazy

1045
01:18:03,290 --> 01:18:06,290
It's not weird. Historically, Osaka's three is three

1046
01:18:06,490 --> 01:18:09,490
I hate it. I'm a detective in charge of the Osaka precincts

1047
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:14,686
That means there are 3,000 in Tokyo too

1048
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:17,710
The reason why there is a police officer in Osaka who can't stop fishing in Osaka is because of a traffic accident

1049
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:20,850
Take me home, I'm on vacation

1050
01:18:20,890 --> 01:18:23,890
I don't want to touch any criminal cases. What are you saying?

1051
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:27,620
Don't you know the police are short on manpower? Take him home

1052
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:31,820
Is there such a rotten way of looking at things? Who are you? I'm Hoshi Kei-san,

1053
01:18:33,610 --> 01:18:36,610
please go home. I'm the detective team

1054
01:18:43,330 --> 01:18:46,330
However, since it is autumn, I will have to pay for the travel expenses

1055
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:50,156
I'm in charge from that place

1056
01:18:50,180 --> 01:18:53,180
I was very grateful to hear various

1057
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:54,686
useful information

1058
01:18:54,710 --> 01:18:57,246
I have one question. Is it possible to catch someone

1059
01:18:57,270 --> 01:18:59,866
even if they are not caught red-handed or engaged in trolling?

1060
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,126
What do you think? You said it yourself,

1061
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,016
so there's no doubt about it

1062
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:06,040
Confessions are unreliable, so

1063
01:19:10,210 --> 01:19:13,210
how much would be appropriate for drugs?

1064
01:19:13,990 --> 01:19:16,990
You guys left but I can't hold on today

1065
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:24,800
It would be a problem if you just let me do it

1066
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:33,740
Oh, was this Professor Rubber? Excuse me

1067
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,096
I'm worried about your happiness

1068
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,120
It's the first time I've heard such a thing from an intellectual like you

1069
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,720
The world is full of crime, sex and eroticism

1070
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:49,890
Is it especially profitable for the teacher? I want this island

1071
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:15,906
Yes, that theory is based on the fact that this person was taken care of in Edo

1072
01:20:15,931 --> 01:20:17,508
She is a pickpocket.

1073
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:19,632
She has 29 convictions.

1074
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,560
I can't get too excited, it's a problem

1075
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:43,560
I still haven't decided to quit being a police officer

1076
01:20:55,240 --> 01:20:58,240
Will it go in? How long will it take?

1077
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:04,440
I guess it'll be about a year

1078
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:10,016
What should I do? What do you think I should do?

1079
01:23:10,040 --> 01:23:12,446
I haven't yet decided to quit police.

1080
01:23:12,470 --> 01:23:13,719
Why are you quiting?

1081
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,977
Hey.
My socks were torn.

1082
01:23:31,759 --> 01:23:33,228
Ouch.

1083
01:23:34,141 --> 01:23:35,438
Don't disturb me.

1084
01:23:35,610 --> 01:23:36,204
I'm sorry.

1085
01:23:36,462 --> 01:23:38,758
Haruko also said hello to you

1086
01:23:51,025 --> 01:23:54,025
Ah, that person I often meet

1087
01:23:54,761 --> 01:23:57,761
Once you see it, you can't forget it. Oh, how sly

1088
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:01,916
Don't wake up the model

1089
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:04,469
I shouldn't have paid that money back.
I wonder if I should ask for it.

1090
01:24:05,370 --> 01:24:07,646
Don't you think I should get it from someone like this? It's my right,

1091
01:24:07,671 --> 01:24:08,727
but what if I don't have it?

1092
01:24:08,946 --> 01:24:10,306
Don't take money from him

1093
01:24:10,576 --> 01:24:11,233
Why?

1094
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:12,337
Whatever.

1095
01:24:12,920 --> 01:24:13,654
Why?

1096
01:24:13,743 --> 01:24:14,461
Whatever.

1097
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:09,977
THE END

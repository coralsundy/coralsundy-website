Hoodlum Soldier's Flight to Freedom (#5)

3
00:00:21,578 --> 00:00:27,211
Soviet troops are currently moving south.

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,398
But We in the Kwantung Army are proud.

5
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:40,586
We will stay here and intercept the enemy.

6
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:45,578
We will fight to the bitter end until we are all dead.

7
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:50,937
I'll keep your life

8
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,187
You guys get it?

9
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:17,634
You guys should get ready

10
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,149
Attack the enemy tanks with your guns today

11
00:01:27,661 --> 00:01:33,372
Attack one tank at a time.

12
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:37,943
We can destroy 100 tanks in total

13
00:02:19,123 --> 00:02:21,630
Hey new comers.
Were you on boarder,right?

14
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:23,005
Yes

15
00:02:23,255 --> 00:02:25,403
Have you seen Soviet tanks?

16
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:28,146
Yes I've seen it once

17
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:29,935
What kind of tanks?

18
00:02:31,029 --> 00:02:32,638
3 times bigger than Japan's

19
00:02:33,669 --> 00:02:35,287
Oh my god..

20
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:39,091
Don't talk!
Work hard!

21
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:58,330
We'll be die?

22
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,573
I don't want

23
00:03:01,766 --> 00:03:05,188
I don't want to die for a tank.

24
00:03:16,186 --> 00:03:17,561
We'll be alive

25
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:21,481
Come on

26
00:03:23,027 --> 00:03:24,387
You get it

27
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,410
Hey you

28
00:03:31,176 --> 00:03:32,129
Why do you laugh?

29
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,096
You are unlucky

30
00:03:35,229 --> 00:03:37,034
I feel annoying.
You go to bed

31
00:03:37,237 --> 00:03:40,268
I'll get it back for you

32
00:03:42,276 --> 00:03:44,081
Try it

33
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:49,964
I took a turn

34
00:04:01,789 --> 00:04:04,102
I'll bid here

35
00:04:05,523 --> 00:04:06,000
I get it

36
00:04:06,117 --> 00:04:06,711

38
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:18,526
Next

39
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:22,169
Once more

40
00:04:28,036 --> 00:04:30,669
Wanna try again?

41
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:32,692

43
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:37,934
Ready?

44
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:40,888

45
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,423
You sure?

46
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:45,462
No.3

47
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:49,892
You sure?

48
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:50,663
Go ahead

49
00:05:01,026 --> 00:05:01,526
Next

50
00:05:02,182 --> 00:05:03,893
Keep going

51
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:06,299
Stop

52
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:07,557

56
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:02,765
What?

57
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:10,775
Damn it!

58
00:06:21,816 --> 00:06:24,714
Stop it!

00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:26,128
Get hands off of me

00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:29,808
I'll kill you guys!

61
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:35,674
You'll kill us?

62
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,206
I can't accept you anymore

63
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,542
Don't look down of me

64

Try to kill me

65
00:06:46,081 --> 00:06:46,917

Stop it!

69
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:27,906
Attention

70
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,078
What's wrong?

71
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:35,609
You guys are too noisy

72
00:07:37,883 --> 00:07:39,594
Listen

73
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,250
Write a letter tonight

74
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:47,578
This is your will

75
00:07:50,188 --> 00:07:53,492
Put your hair and nails in it.

76
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:56,805
I'll pass it over the next coming unit

77
00:07:57,891 --> 00:07:58,461
OK?

78
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,481
That's all

79
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:14,709
What's wrong?

80
00:08:17,031 --> 00:08:19,758
You don't write?

81
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,061
Oh you can't write words

82
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,694
I'll write it for you

83
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:34,819
Please

84
00:08:35,498 --> 00:08:36,162
To whom?

85
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:37,459

86
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,186

89
00:08:52,618 --> 00:08:53,641
Only one?

90
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:57,250
Who do you prefer?

91
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,234
How about Momoko?

92
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:04,250
You got married with her,right?

93
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:06,627
Right

94
00:09:10,955 --> 00:09:11,752
What do you wanna say?

95
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:16,127
How do you read this?

96
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:20,104
My 24yrs life was miserable

97
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:26,549
Write I loved your figure

98
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,010
I won't forget about you

99
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,487
I might go to die

100
00:09:40,588 --> 00:09:48,065
I wanted to die on your stomach

101
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,309
Is that funny?

102
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,262
Not

103
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:07,094
You're free to marry with anyone now

104
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,101
Good luck

105
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:16,022
That's all

106
00:10:17,663 --> 00:10:20,233
Write something else

107
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:42,923
You're so easygoing.

108
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,491
Enemies are not coming

109
00:10:50,202 --> 00:10:55,952
I hear they are at Sogo now

110
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,819
Sogo is south of here

111
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:02,335
They passed over here

112
00:11:02,546 --> 00:11:04,194
I don't think so

113
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,819
If it's gold and pawns in chess, I go for gold.

114
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,217
You're saying nice

Actually we are parents

128
00:12:43,006 --> 00:12:48,865
I let her escape by pretending to be a man

129
00:12:49,132 --> 00:12:51,053
actually she is very beautiful

130
00:12:52,843 --> 00:12:54,944
Please Help us

131
00:12:56,386 --> 00:13:00,081
we want to help you but we die here

132
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,495
We can't protect you

133
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:07,901
we would like to support you as much as possible

134
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,968
Ok, you can stay here

135
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:14,577
Good for you

137
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:17,666
Hello?

138
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,583
What can I do for you?

139
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,684
Can you take care of them?

140
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:29,215
One is female

141
00:13:31,736 --> 00:13:33,127
female

142
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,025
Don't touch her

143
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:45,103
Women should stay in separate dormitories

144
00:13:45,408 --> 00:13:52,010
Let's stay in a separate dormitory with our soldiers

145
00:13:52,533 --> 00:13:53,182
OK

146
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:56,728

Please leave from here

150
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:25,063
I'll shout

151
00:14:25,923 --> 00:14:30,673
I wanted to confirm if you are a woman

152
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:34,807
Enjoy your bath

153
00:14:41,693 --> 00:14:44,826
You guys! Wake up!

154
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:47,333
It's urgent!

155
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,224
What's wrong?

156
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:53,263
Listen,
there is a woman

157
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:57,982
don't be surprised

158
00:14:58,427 --> 00:15:00,435
She's young and beautiful

159
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:02,404
You're lying

160
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,177
Please enter the dormitory behind the headquarters and check.

161
00:15:05,388 --> 00:15:07,170
I saw her for sure

162
00:15:08,465 --> 00:15:11,215
It seems that there is a woman here

163
00:15:12,707 --> 00:15:14,417
there is a woman

164
00:15:14,637 --> 00:15:15,793
Really?

165
00:15:16,035 --> 00:15:18,731
I am happy to be alive

166
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:24,229
you look really stupid

167
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:30,362
they are comfort group,have run away

168
00:15:30,893 --> 00:15:32,041
Did you take them?

169
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:34,932
I know them

170
00:15:36,284 --> 00:15:38,252
Is the person female?

171
00:15:41,894 --> 00:15:43,699
You are quick-tempered.

172
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:44,816
Damn it

173
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:48,879
Thank you for your hard work every day

174
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:55,301
We are a comfort group, but we don't have any musical instruments.

175
00:15:55,865 --> 00:15:59,834
we threw away our tools on the run

176
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,030
But today I borrowed a harmonica from a soldier

177
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:09,670
I blow this harmonica and my daughter sings

178
00:16:12,468 --> 00:16:13,953
she sings a Japanese song

179
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:14,023
she looks like my first love

180
00:17:15,883 --> 00:17:17,141
First love

181
00:17:33,922 --> 00:17:37,157
Then I sing your hometown song

182
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,906
How dare you

183
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,758
Be quiet

184
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,588
Hi,can I have your name?

185
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:23,744
I'm Yayoi

186
00:19:24,486 --> 00:19:25,026
Yayoi?

187
00:19:26,174 --> 00:19:28,963
That's good name.
I'm Omiya

188
00:19:30,114 --> 00:19:31,231
Omiya?

189
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:37,801
You look like my first love

190
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:41,090
Everyone says same

191
00:19:43,395 --> 00:19:45,278
I really mean it

192
00:19:47,168 --> 00:19:52,590
The higher the rank of the soldiers, the more liars they become.

193
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,191
Like manager

194
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,535
Omiya

195
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,519
do you have permission?

196
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:05,609
you didn't see this board?

197
00:20:09,763 --> 00:20:11,685
I can't read

198
00:20:12,146 --> 00:20:13,169
What?

199
00:20:14,427 --> 00:20:15,763
I can't read

200
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:19,068
you are still a boy soldier

201
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:28,707
Your face is too hard

202
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:43,863
Damn it

203
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:51,404
You bastard

204
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:55,052
Stand up

205
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,904
Wait

206
00:21:22,191 --> 00:21:23,019
Omiya

207
00:21:28,918 --> 00:21:29,769
Stop it

208
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:31,402
Stop it

209
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,754
Stop it

210
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,390
You should be patient.

211
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:43,116
we are patient

212
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:55,000
I want you to be patient too

213
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,062
I'll tell him

214
00:22:00,405 --> 00:22:01,374
We'll be back

215
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:19,207
Omiya

216
00:22:29,937 --> 00:22:32,351
Boss is calling you

217
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:38,349
Your daughter is called Yayoi,right?

218
00:22:40,476 --> 00:22:44,530
I want her to serve us

219
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:46,640
What do you mean?

220
00:22:47,256 --> 00:22:53,342
We may die so we want her to serve

221
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:55,379
You know?

222
00:22:56,434 --> 00:22:57,856
I can't

223
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,309
It's just the three of us, not all the soldiers.

224
00:23:02,852 --> 00:23:05,313
Please forgive us

225
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:07,111
I know she's not a comfort woman

226
00:23:08,439 --> 00:23:09,970
So I'm asking you a favor

227
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:17,674
If you agree, we will move you to a safe place.

228
00:23:19,948 --> 00:23:25,456
It seems that the last train will leave from here tomorrow.

229
00:23:26,534 --> 00:23:27,534
We'll get you on it

230
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:32,308
You guys are able to go back to Japan

231
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:34,663
What can I do...

232
00:23:36,718 --> 00:23:42,343
I'd rather die than ask you that

233
00:23:45,345 --> 00:23:50,782
we'll get out of here tonight

234
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,986
I don't wanna die

235
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:56,572
But

236
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,783
We'll be over

237
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:02,290
we struggled to escape

238
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:05,306
I ran away to live

239
00:24:06,689 --> 00:24:08,181
But

240
00:24:09,471 --> 00:24:10,760
we'll get out of here

241
00:24:11,767 --> 00:24:14,338
I'll sleep with them

242
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:19,229
I follow him

243
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:20,494
yayoi

244
00:24:20,713 --> 00:24:21,901
It can't be helped

245
00:24:24,659 --> 00:24:28,088
It's ok.
juts for living

246
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:31,190
It's ok.

247
00:24:47,732 --> 00:24:48,928
Thank you for coming

248
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:53,959
We can take the train tomorrow,right?

249
00:24:53,994 --> 00:24:56,174
Yes, no worries

250
00:25:00,678 --> 00:25:02,631
You guys go outside

251
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:28,492
where are you going?

252
00:25:29,023 --> 00:25:30,187
I’m going to the bathroom

253
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,297
bathroom?

254
00:25:33,641 --> 00:25:34,117
What's that?

255
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,758
Are you going to eat yokan in the restroom later?

256
00:25:40,571 --> 00:25:41,836
you go to the dormitory,right?

257
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:16,923
Where's yayoi?

258
00:26:18,915 --> 00:26:19,579
What's wrong?

259
00:27:09,764 --> 00:27:10,764
What the hell you are?

260
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,022
What the hell you are?

261
00:28:04,938 --> 00:28:06,086
Stop it

262
00:28:52,893 --> 00:28:57,260
You did terrible things.
Are you okay?

263
00:28:58,198 --> 00:29:00,675
they are bad

264
00:29:01,616 --> 00:29:03,663
sorry for bothering you for me

265
00:29:05,968 --> 00:29:06,554
It's ok

266
00:29:11,886 --> 00:29:12,988
Oh no

267
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:24,714
I helped you but...

268
00:29:28,425 --> 00:29:40,144
I was going to attack you at night

269
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:48,254
Well

270
00:30:01,825 --> 00:30:02,911
That's what you planed

271
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:06,754
I know how you feel

272
00:30:10,693 --> 00:30:16,349
I'm falling in love with you

273
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,584
Just once

274
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:33,412
I made a deal with them to get on the train tomorrow.

275
00:30:56,129 --> 00:30:59,996
Eat this later

276
00:31:00,926 --> 00:31:02,152
Omiya

277
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:05,656
It's ok if you stay here

278
00:31:11,028 --> 00:31:16,536
I can't get you on the train

279
00:31:51,684 --> 00:31:54,590
you came late.
What happened?

280
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,996
Nothing

281
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:53,345
What's wrong?

282
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:54,798
Untie me

283
00:33:03,573 --> 00:33:05,964
Boss call you

284
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,065
Come to see him

285
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:27,856
May I come in?

286
00:33:36,372 --> 00:33:37,512
I'm here

287
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:54,678
did you have fun last night?

288
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,389
Tell me about it

289
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:34,181
Come here

290
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:46,605
Damn it

291
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:50,738
Damn it

292
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,202
Shit

293
00:35:18,546 --> 00:35:19,413
Leader

294
00:35:21,226 --> 00:35:24,124
Omiya is getting violent

295
00:35:37,937 --> 00:35:39,015
How do you feel?

296
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:57,898
Look at this,dude

297
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,849
Omiya

298
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:04,263
Stop it

299
00:36:09,364 --> 00:36:10,982
I'll manage this

300
00:36:14,013 --> 00:36:14,786
Omiya

301
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:21,943
you escort her to the station

302
00:36:24,171 --> 00:36:29,500
Get two people on the last train today

303
00:36:30,864 --> 00:36:31,372
Go

304
00:36:31,903 --> 00:36:32,450
Yes

305
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:38,630
I will escort them

306
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,524
Thank you for your help

307
00:38:06,688 --> 00:38:09,884
I am very grateful to you

308
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:12,318
Thank you very much

309
00:38:13,263 --> 00:38:15,489
I'm sorry I didn't thank you for anything

310
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,838
Thank you

311
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:29,604
When I come back to Japan, I will go to your house.
do you have anything to contact?

312
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,682
I have no home

313
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:37,301
Let's get on this train and go home together

314
00:38:38,176 --> 00:38:41,848
I have a spare set of clothes.
Please wear it

315
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,388
Please come

316
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:47,645
Please change your outfit

317
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,161
Please do it

318
00:38:50,974 --> 00:38:54,294
If you get on this train, you will return to Japan.

319
00:38:56,971 --> 00:38:58,182
Quickly

320
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:00,346
Please change your outfit

Omiya

322
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,070
If you go back to the unit, you will die

323
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:09,405
I have to go back

324
00:39:10,186 --> 00:39:11,491
Please change your outfit

325
00:39:12,905 --> 00:39:14,061

328
00:39:21,132 --> 00:39:23,553
Let's go back to Japan together

329
00:39:29,402 --> 00:39:32,465
I won't forget about you

330
00:39:34,629 --> 00:39:38,723

350
00:42:44,548 --> 00:42:46,337
Mr.private first class

351
00:42:57,086 --> 00:42:58,234
Look at that

352
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:02,891
that place has fallen

353
00:43:05,774 --> 00:43:06,695
What should I do?

354
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:11,078
anyway let's walk south

355
00:43:12,852 --> 00:43:15,422
Take it easy

356
00:43:16,805 --> 00:43:18,024
It's long way

357
00:43:43,143 --> 00:43:45,416
I'm tired

358
00:43:50,556 --> 00:43:53,494
Look at that well

359
00:44:27,886 --> 00:44:29,495
I'm thirty

360
00:44:29,909 --> 00:44:31,113
Thanks

361
00:45:16,302 --> 00:45:17,349
Look at that

362
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:29,693
this is from japan

363
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,154
This was a  Manchurian guerrillas base.

364
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:39,326
I heard that the number of Manchurian guerrillas is increasing.

365
00:45:41,263 --> 00:45:42,404
It's dangerous to walk

366
00:45:43,879 --> 00:45:47,691
We'd be safer in a unit somewhere.

367
00:45:50,595 --> 00:45:52,720
do we go back to the army?

368
00:45:52,993 --> 00:45:54,181
It's much safer

369
00:46:01,787 --> 00:46:06,272
let's go back to the army and be officers

370
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:09,374
officers?

371
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,335
this dress is just right

372
00:46:21,685 --> 00:46:23,592
You look good

373
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,084
Don't call me as Mr.private first class

374
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:28,225
Oh yeah,
Arita Lieutenant

375
00:46:30,908 --> 00:46:33,830
You don't look like a private either.

376
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:36,901
my face looks better

377
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:41,757
I can make you a commander

378
00:46:55,883 --> 00:46:56,961
Let's get in that truck

379
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:00,718
Stop

380
00:47:13,742 --> 00:47:14,641
where are you going?

381
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,297
To 103 unit

382
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,875
We'll go there together

383
00:47:26,232 --> 00:47:27,224
Good

384
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,381
Thanks.
Where's main office?

385
00:48:09,694 --> 00:48:10,866
Over there

386
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:12,928
what is the name of the commander?

387
00:48:14,030 --> 00:48:15,233
Yanagida commander

388
00:48:19,225 --> 00:48:22,194
were you the only ones who survived?

389
00:48:22,413 --> 00:48:23,022
Yes

390
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:26,218
Did you run away?

391
00:48:27,606 --> 00:48:32,052
I fainted from the blast, but miraculously survived

392
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,603
This guy look fine

393
00:48:37,751 --> 00:48:41,868
he was escorting refugees

394
00:48:45,498 --> 00:48:49,139
you look so scary

395
00:48:50,212 --> 00:48:51,697
he is an executive candidate

396
00:48:52,127 --> 00:48:53,150
I'm not asking you

397
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:55,298
where did you train?

398
00:48:56,064 --> 00:48:56,619
Maebashi

399
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:58,904
I'm not asking you

400
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:01,052
which university did you graduate from?

401
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:03,302
Uni...

402
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:07,123
Tokyo Uni

403
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:09,467
Oh really?

404
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:12,357
People don't care what they look like

405
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:15,493
what year are you an officer?

406
00:49:18,384 --> 00:49:19,485
5 or 6 yrs

407
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:23,044
You're slow to rise to the occasion.

408
00:49:23,786 --> 00:49:28,403
what did the special training teach?

409
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:31,913
Well...

410
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,045
Fighting

411
00:49:34,506 --> 00:49:36,819
What? Fighting?

412
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:42,475
You're funny guy

413
00:49:42,808 --> 00:49:46,801
I hate smart people, but you are not

414
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:52,812
By the way do you have souvenirs?

415
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:55,562
souvenirs?

416
00:49:55,905 --> 00:50:01,734
You can't enter another unit unless you bring a souvenir.

417
00:50:03,029 --> 00:50:04,419
You didn't know that?

418
00:50:05,989 --> 00:50:10,177
If you don't have souvenirs, you can't enter this unit.

419
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,378
He's scam

420
00:51:04,972 --> 00:51:07,097
We're doing better

421
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:09,386
But Mr.private first class

422
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:11,620
Omiya

423
00:51:14,651 --> 00:51:15,706
Lieutenant

424
00:51:17,969 --> 00:51:23,695
the army is a funny place.
You can't escape, you can't enter

425
00:51:39,313 --> 00:51:42,040
You don't have to salute him.

426
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:44,250
You are higher

427
00:51:45,776 --> 00:51:49,378
I forgot about it

428
00:51:49,464 --> 00:51:50,948
May I come in?

429
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,007
I brought food for you

430
00:51:57,632 --> 00:51:59,249
I brought food for you

431
00:52:00,288 --> 00:52:01,647
Thanks

432
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:09,624
There is a shortage of food, but it is a sumptuous meal

433
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,280
you are special

434
00:52:11,937 --> 00:52:15,319
If there is laundry, please give it to me

435
00:52:16,514 --> 00:52:17,561
It's ok

436
00:52:18,975 --> 00:52:20,928
Call us if you need help

437
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:27,722
See you

438
00:52:37,301 --> 00:52:40,691
Being officer is good

439
00:52:41,644 --> 00:52:44,308
It is said that officers and beggars cannot stop after three days.

440
00:52:44,879 --> 00:52:47,207
I never want to be a soldier again

441
00:52:55,234 --> 00:52:57,499
Now is training time

442
00:52:59,023 --> 00:53:02,234
We are Omiya and Arita officer

443
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:04,472
Are you active soldier ?

444
00:53:04,754 --> 00:53:06,285
I'm from gakuto

445
00:53:07,511 --> 00:53:08,433
Oh I see

446
00:53:09,746 --> 00:53:15,511
I want to know how advanced the Soviet army is

447
00:53:18,058 --> 00:53:21,074
Xingjing and Harbin was occupied by the Soviet army.

448
00:53:22,012 --> 00:53:23,098
I see

449
00:53:24,824 --> 00:53:30,598
After eating, please teach the soldiers about anti-tank attacks.

450
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:36,894
Oh shit

451
00:53:52,872 --> 00:53:53,692
Stop

452
00:54:02,481 --> 00:54:05,130
Listen

453
00:54:07,136 --> 00:54:10,370
We're going to practice anti-tank attacks from now on

454
00:54:12,439 --> 00:54:19,337
soviet tanks are so big they are hard to hit

455
00:54:20,971 --> 00:54:22,737
you should stop fighting them

456
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:30,471
You can travel a short distance

457
00:54:32,176 --> 00:54:39,457
we stop training and take a nap

458
00:54:41,918 --> 00:54:43,379
Come here

459
00:54:48,005 --> 00:54:53,841
Let's take turns taking a nap in case the leader finds us

460
00:54:55,704 --> 00:55:00,072
wake me up in the evening

461
00:55:06,501 --> 00:55:07,181
Good sleep

462
00:55:08,626 --> 00:55:12,689
It's my first time working with an officer like you.

463
00:55:13,939 --> 00:55:15,525
do you think I’m reliable?

464
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,962
Yes very

465
00:55:17,657 --> 00:55:23,165
I think your face is so great

466
00:55:24,977 --> 00:55:31,781
You are very dignified even when you are naked

467
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:37,393
your skin is so beautiful

468
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:40,659
Is this ok?

469
00:55:40,854 --> 00:55:41,971
Yes

470
00:55:42,784 --> 00:55:46,916
You look like Eigoro Ohmaeda

471
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,268
Eigoro Ohmaeda?

472
00:55:48,784 --> 00:55:50,901
I respect him

473
00:55:50,926 --> 00:55:51,909
I see

474
00:55:53,177 --> 00:55:55,013
I like talking with you

475
00:55:56,224 --> 00:55:57,685
do you like movies?

476
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:58,779
Yes I love

477
00:55:59,115 --> 00:56:02,615
Jirocho of Seven Rings and Eigoro Omaeda

478
00:56:02,982 --> 00:56:04,467
We respect them

479
00:56:04,982 --> 00:56:07,232
I like Yakuza too

480
00:56:07,357 --> 00:56:08,287
I see

481
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:09,514
Where did you play?

482
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,217
Kansai's Asakichi is famous.

483
00:56:13,678 --> 00:56:14,342
Asakichi

484
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:15,264
You know of him?

485
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:15,764
No

486
00:56:17,232 --> 00:56:20,514
play with me next time

487
00:56:22,607 --> 00:56:23,982
Thanks in advance

488
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:33,522
I get it

489
00:56:34,663 --> 00:56:36,452
You're very strong

490
00:56:37,006 --> 00:56:40,756
gambling is my business

491
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,186
you are very senior

492
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:46,749
But it's very rare

493
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:48,272
For what?

494
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:52,522
I heard that you graduated from the University of Tokyo.

495
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,702
How do you know?

496
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:57,819
From leader

497
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:00,717
don't talk about college

498
00:57:07,213 --> 00:57:08,752
I took this

499
00:57:18,792 --> 00:57:19,885
What department did you study in?

500
00:57:21,565 --> 00:57:23,018
What department?

501
00:57:24,893 --> 00:57:28,190
I studied in the First Investigative Division

502
00:57:32,426 --> 00:57:34,137
you are good at joking

503
00:57:35,629 --> 00:57:37,793
don't talk about college

504
00:57:41,361 --> 00:57:42,016
I won

505
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:44,228
I'm Yamaoka.
May I come in?

506
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:48,722
Kiyoshima officer

507
00:57:48,761 --> 00:57:49,245
What?

508
00:57:49,363 --> 00:57:50,800
Unit leader is calling you

509
00:57:53,956 --> 00:57:55,066
Excuse me

510
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,950
Be careful what they say about college

511
00:58:07,645 --> 00:58:09,505
you seem to be getting used to

512
00:58:10,434 --> 00:58:14,622
It's easier to imitate officer

513
00:58:18,191 --> 00:58:22,566
we should have been officers sooner

514
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,840
we seem to be wasting our time

515
00:58:31,797 --> 00:58:32,610
Who are you?

516
00:58:35,008 --> 00:58:35,852
You're Aoyagi

517
00:58:36,469 --> 00:58:40,938
I thought there was someone who looked like you guys, so I went to check

518
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,309
don't be scared.
I'm no longer Kenpei

519
00:58:52,926 --> 00:58:54,216
Did you get fired?

520
00:58:55,286 --> 00:58:56,731
I finished work

521
00:58:56,926 --> 00:58:59,067
So you got down grade to private first class

522
00:58:59,606 --> 00:59:02,723
I imitate him like you

523
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:09,531
you're pretending to be a soldier

524
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,508
Being soldier is easy going

525
00:59:19,209 --> 00:59:24,436
You guys are disguised as officers and look like idiots

526
00:59:25,334 --> 00:59:27,396
Japan will lose

527
00:59:28,482 --> 00:59:33,365
Either we're prisoners of the Soviet Union or we're killed by them.

528
00:59:34,312 --> 00:59:36,468
You'll be killed

529
00:59:38,968 --> 00:59:39,890
Aoyagi

530
00:59:44,793 --> 00:59:46,481
Are you here to deal with us?

531
00:59:48,356 --> 00:59:50,223
I wanna work with you

532
00:59:54,594 --> 00:59:55,922
Let's run away with me

533
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,532
Steal a unit's truck and go to the Korean Peninsula

534
01:00:01,415 --> 01:00:05,133
If you go to GENZAN on the Korean Peninsula, there are boats bound for Japan every day.

535
01:00:05,891 --> 01:00:07,352
This is a only way we survive

536
01:00:14,216 --> 01:00:17,716
If the three of us work together, things will go well

537
01:00:18,043 --> 01:00:19,832
You are officer now

538
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:25,449
And You're good at running away

539
01:00:39,704 --> 01:00:41,594
Can you?

540
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:44,219
We decline

541
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:46,493
We decline

542
01:00:50,843 --> 01:00:53,124
I thought you guys were smart

543
01:00:54,577 --> 01:00:55,749
I'm disappointed about you

544
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:03,155
Damn it

545
01:01:16,979 --> 01:01:17,940
Omiya

546
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:22,166
It's urgent, Wake up

547
01:01:23,832 --> 01:01:25,621
Wake up

548
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:47,621
Stand up

549
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:54,986
you're still like a soldier

550
01:01:55,088 --> 01:01:57,080
I'm used to it

551
01:01:57,676 --> 01:01:58,731
don't impress yourself

552
01:01:59,864 --> 01:02:01,004
Come,officers

553
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:13,091
Communist guerrillas are expected to gather 6 km north of here.

554
01:02:14,072 --> 01:02:20,869
We prepare for battle and destroy the enemy

555
01:02:22,705 --> 01:02:28,197
Second Lieutenant Omiya, please go scout out the enemy's situation.

556
01:02:28,494 --> 01:02:29,018
Yes

557
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:32,932
What is officer plan?

558
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,307
You just go

559
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:37,963
You get it?

560
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:39,182
No

561
01:02:57,735 --> 01:02:58,696
What's that?

562
01:02:59,688 --> 01:03:00,735
Hold on

563
01:03:05,352 --> 01:03:06,235
I'm Japanese

564
01:03:06,626 --> 01:03:09,915
I belong to pleasure groups.
Please help me

565
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:13,018
Please

566
01:03:14,924 --> 01:03:15,705
What's wrong?

567
01:03:15,730 --> 01:03:20,440
I evacuated with a woman and child to the hospital, but they were attacked by guerrillas.

568
01:03:21,446 --> 01:03:27,719
I ran away to ask you, so please

569
01:03:29,114 --> 01:03:31,747
I'm not unit leader.
I'm Second Lieutenant

570
01:03:31,911 --> 01:03:33,872
Second Lieutenant, please

571
01:03:34,192 --> 01:03:37,489
Women, children and the sick are isolated

572
01:03:38,253 --> 01:03:40,401
I'm in trouble even if you ask me

573
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:45,237
You are officer

574
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:49,323
Yes I am but

575
01:03:52,683 --> 01:03:55,839
I present you another Officer

576
01:03:58,912 --> 01:04:00,303
Ok I get it

577
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:04,787
I'll ask our leader

578
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,037
Good for you

579
01:04:08,647 --> 01:04:10,803
I want to help him but I can't

580
01:04:11,069 --> 01:04:12,631
Eh what?

581
01:04:13,218 --> 01:04:18,664
We can't afford it.
we need to leave from here

582
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:25,631
Sick man, woman and child asking for help

583
01:04:25,656 --> 01:04:27,673
It's urgent

584
01:04:28,634 --> 01:04:30,673
You should be polite

585
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,444
this is the command

586
01:04:34,835 --> 01:04:35,359
But

587
01:04:35,384 --> 01:04:36,734
It can't be helped

588
01:04:36,952 --> 01:04:37,788
Leader

589
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:44,148
2 hours to get there by truck

590
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:47,616
I don't think there will be any obstacles to creating a withdrawal

591
01:04:47,921 --> 01:04:52,187
this is not easy

592
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,929
There's a communist guerrilla base 6 M from here.

593
01:04:56,335 --> 01:04:58,491
you don't have to be afraid of them

594
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:01,624
you are stubborn

595
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:04,023
this interferes with the operation

596
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:07,398
I don't think so.
We can leave after that

597
01:05:08,210 --> 01:05:10,749
do you disagree with me?

598
01:05:10,945 --> 01:05:14,757
I think the Japanese have helped the Japanese.

599
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:29,373
If you lend me a truck and five non-commissioned officers, Omiya and I will go.

600
01:05:30,477 --> 01:05:32,641
I won't bother you

601
01:05:36,489 --> 01:05:40,114
go if you want to go

602
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:42,262
Yes

603
01:05:45,745 --> 01:05:50,268
You were unlucky to be selected for the rescue team.

604
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:53,839
I chose you guys for a reason

605
01:05:54,807 --> 01:05:58,057
you have courage

606
01:05:59,245 --> 01:06:03,096
I want you to complete the mission for the Japanese.

607
01:06:42,654 --> 01:06:46,514
Don't give up that you're out of luck

608
01:06:48,952 --> 01:06:51,952
we may be attacked by the enemy

609
01:06:53,006 --> 01:06:55,287
Are you sure you follow them?

610
01:06:55,506 --> 01:06:56,608
It can't be helped

611
01:06:57,787 --> 01:06:58,873
do you want to die?

612
01:06:59,069 --> 01:07:00,139
What should I do?

613
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:02,030
leave them and go back

614
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:07,287
We're going to Korea without going back to our unit.

615
01:07:07,569 --> 01:07:08,162
To Korea?

616
01:07:08,373 --> 01:07:11,405
If we go to Korea, we can go back to Japan

617
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:18,901
You may not know it, but Japan will lose the war.

618
01:07:19,933 --> 01:07:22,245
If we go back to Japan now, we won't have to die.

619
01:07:23,276 --> 01:07:25,683
we will either die or be taken prisoner

620
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:36,660
You people should value your own lives.

621
01:07:44,764 --> 01:07:46,413
how do you get away from them?

622
01:07:47,178 --> 01:07:48,085
I'll manage it

623
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,397
Can you?

624
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:50,999
I have a plan

625
01:07:53,256 --> 01:07:56,366
I have already looked into ways to get to Korea.

626
01:07:59,163 --> 01:08:00,124
What do you think?

627
01:08:24,745 --> 01:08:27,745
If you want to go to the toilet, go now

628
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:33,936
What's wrong?

629
01:08:53,981 --> 01:08:57,762
If you don't decide quickly, you might be attacked by guerrillas.

630
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:03,659
Hey

631
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:05,604
I won't go

632
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:07,448
Why?

633
01:09:07,924 --> 01:09:09,260
I don't feel like it

634
01:09:10,213 --> 01:09:11,174
Mind if you die?

635
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,956
I can't betray Omiya

636
01:09:16,466 --> 01:09:18,013
You like him so much

637
01:09:18,231 --> 01:09:19,278
Yes I do

638
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,981
I will tell you the truth

639
01:09:25,497 --> 01:09:29,372
they are not really officers

640
01:09:30,138 --> 01:09:30,778
What?

641
01:09:31,599 --> 01:09:34,638
they are just soldiers and fakes

642
01:09:35,575 --> 01:09:36,372
You sure?

643
01:09:36,915 --> 01:09:43,008
they are notorious for being problem children.
you don't have to die for them

644
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,665
what are they doing?

645
01:10:04,001 --> 01:10:05,438
Go to the bed of the truck

646
01:10:07,212 --> 01:10:08,181
Stop here

647
01:11:03,456 --> 01:11:04,808
Get off

648
01:11:05,792 --> 01:11:06,652
Get off

649
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:13,472
Push

650
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:21,394
Push

651
01:11:25,590 --> 01:11:26,598
OK

652
01:11:29,512 --> 01:11:31,223
do you still have fuel?

653
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,059
Yes

654
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:38,825
Aoyagi

655
01:11:39,599 --> 01:11:42,075
Freeze!

656
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:44,349
kill them

657
01:11:45,497 --> 01:11:47,013
I'll kill them

658
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:49,052
Kill me

659
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:53,083
I will blow myself up

660
01:11:53,872 --> 01:11:56,067
You know who is he?

661
01:11:57,520 --> 01:11:58,809
He's Kenpei

662
01:12:19,819 --> 01:12:20,608
Damn it

663
01:12:27,897 --> 01:12:28,983
Wait

664
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:31,014
I'll beat him

665
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:32,030
Stop it

666
01:12:37,085 --> 01:12:39,928
take him with us.
It's better if soldiers are more

667
01:12:45,686 --> 01:12:49,593
Listen,
We are fake officers

668
01:12:50,702 --> 01:12:53,101
I'm 5 grade, Omiya is 2nd grade soldiers

669
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:57,108
we were in an army prison

670
01:12:58,351 --> 01:13:00,273
I've been found and I'm throwing this away.

671
01:13:05,353 --> 01:13:10,345
But I want to finish my mission to the end

672
01:13:14,241 --> 01:13:18,217
The sick and children await us in Samkatan

673
01:13:20,858 --> 01:13:24,147
It seems that a newborn baby is there

674
01:13:25,507 --> 01:13:27,929
Suppose they are your babies

675
01:13:29,593 --> 01:13:32,452
Suppose they are your wives

676
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:38,327
If we abandon them, they will be attacked by the enemy.

677
01:13:44,930 --> 01:13:47,203
We can't leave them

678
01:13:54,133 --> 01:13:55,266
Ok Let's go

679
01:13:57,258 --> 01:13:59,618
Thanks, Takagi

680
01:13:59,813 --> 01:14:01,243
I'll go too

681
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:03,415
Thanks.

682
01:14:05,134 --> 01:14:06,884
Thanks guys

683
01:14:08,446 --> 01:14:10,305
Get him on the truck

684
01:14:13,856 --> 01:14:14,973
Stand up

685
01:14:28,523 --> 01:14:29,523
Let's go!

686
01:15:13,178 --> 01:15:14,155
Use this

687
01:15:19,147 --> 01:15:20,209
Put on this

688
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:24,187
Put on this

689
01:15:46,294 --> 01:15:47,208
Watch out!

690
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,522
You guys all right?

691
01:16:46,433 --> 01:16:47,214
This is yours

692
01:17:10,294 --> 01:17:11,911
A truck is coming

693
01:17:13,099 --> 01:17:15,052
soldiers are coming

694
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,119
Where is the sick?

695
01:17:38,599 --> 01:17:40,677
soldiers are here

696
01:17:45,630 --> 01:17:48,935
Get on the truck from the emergency sick

697
01:17:55,573 --> 01:17:58,417
Thank you very much

698
01:18:07,528 --> 01:18:09,646
Get on the truck from the sick.

699
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:13,929
There is only one truck.
Get on the truck from the sick.

700
01:18:14,101 --> 01:18:16,711
Then babies and kids

701
01:18:20,201 --> 01:18:21,436
Get on the truck from the sick.

702
01:18:22,326 --> 01:18:24,287
Hold on

703
01:18:24,576 --> 01:18:27,975
Listen, you guys

704
01:18:29,099 --> 01:18:34,950
I know  you guys all wanna get on , but it's impossible for all people to get on

705
01:18:36,247 --> 01:18:42,267
Kids who goes to school needs to line up as adults

706
01:18:43,525 --> 01:18:45,595
Get him on

707
01:18:45,947 --> 01:18:47,134
He needs to wait

708
01:18:47,212 --> 01:18:48,228
He's still 6 yrs old

709
01:18:48,384 --> 01:18:49,611
Don't make a lie

710
01:18:49,636 --> 01:18:51,712
Get him on,please

711
01:18:53,626 --> 01:18:56,376
Don't be selfish

712
01:18:57,259 --> 01:18:58,369
Can you walk?

713
01:18:58,431 --> 01:18:59,486
Yes I can

714
01:18:59,626 --> 01:19:01,884
Let him walk

715
01:19:02,548 --> 01:19:12,581
A long walk with my mother will give me good memories in the future.

716
01:19:13,378 --> 01:19:16,206
Is there any sick left?

717
01:19:17,409 --> 01:19:20,495
Line up, everyone

718
01:19:20,777 --> 01:19:23,386
You guys line up here

719
01:19:29,191 --> 01:19:34,511
We are going first.
You guard the truck

720
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,248
We're heading to Bashou

721
01:19:45,422 --> 01:19:47,109
It takes about 50km

722
01:19:48,875 --> 01:19:51,695
Enemy might attack us in half way

723
01:19:52,820 --> 01:19:56,055
Follow me in the case

724
01:19:58,457 --> 01:19:59,528
Go!

725
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:11,038
Everyone go

726
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,974
They are coming

727
01:20:47,524 --> 01:20:49,641
They are coming

728
01:22:12,702 --> 01:22:14,069
What’s wrong?

729
01:22:14,648 --> 01:22:15,609
Stop

730
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:17,835
We'll take a rest here

731
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:28,297
We'll get to sleep until sun goes down, then walk again

732
01:22:29,554 --> 01:22:35,812
We'll walk in the night.
We need to take a rest now

733
01:22:38,315 --> 01:22:39,713
You get it?

734
01:22:40,314 --> 01:22:40,907
Yes

735
01:23:13,766 --> 01:23:16,368
Kawabe,
Navigage them

736
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:19,194
Escape from here

737
01:23:19,241 --> 01:23:20,702
You move ahead

738
01:24:49,252 --> 01:24:50,807
Aim to their base

739
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:09,549
We made it

740
01:25:32,600 --> 01:25:34,725
You guys all right?

741
01:25:35,014 --> 01:25:36,155
Kawabe

742
01:25:36,365 --> 01:25:37,240
Goto

743
01:25:37,592 --> 01:25:38,561
Murakami

744
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:39,647
Aoyagi

745
01:25:43,725 --> 01:25:44,655
Aoyagi

746
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:50,069
Aoyagi

747
01:25:58,863 --> 01:25:59,535
Arita

748
01:26:06,912 --> 01:26:08,451
I was a scoundrel

749
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,498
No.
You have been reborn.

750
01:26:16,496 --> 01:26:21,309
I'll still be a scoundrel the next time I'm born.

751
01:26:26,014 --> 01:26:26,772
Good luck

752
01:26:30,733 --> 01:26:31,475
Aoyagi

753
01:26:57,956 --> 01:27:00,425
We'll be there soon

754
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,777
Just 4km left

755
01:27:04,511 --> 01:27:08,511
We can take a rest there, and you can see your family

756
01:27:09,378 --> 01:27:10,527
Keep going!

757
01:27:18,644 --> 01:27:20,199
You are tired?

758
01:27:24,342 --> 01:27:25,318
Let's go

759
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:53,150
THE END

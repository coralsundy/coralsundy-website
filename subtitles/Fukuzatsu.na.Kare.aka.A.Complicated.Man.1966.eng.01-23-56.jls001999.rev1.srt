2
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,719
Excuse me.

3
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:45,013
Do you need something to drink?

4
00:00:45,037 --> 00:00:48,037
I don't need.

5
00:00:56,175 --> 00:00:59,175
A passenger apparently wants a Martini wine.

6
00:00:59,263 --> 00:01:00,576
This is the fourth cup.

7
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,260
He's still sober.

8
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:05,284
He's amazing.

9
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,280
Sorry I kept you waiting

10
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:24,418
The airtrip is very tiresome,
I need this Martini to help pass the time

11
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,433
Well, I will try to cheer you up

12
00:01:27,919 --> 00:01:29,123
Oh, please

13
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,816
Now, guess

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,840
In a shower, one person is having a shower

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,100
Now, there is one person, right?

16
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:39,496
Right

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,433
And now.

18
00:01:41,457 --> 00:01:43,626
There are two people taking a shower

19
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,446
That's right, exactly two

20
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,957
And now...

21
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:47,625
Three?

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,012
That's right

23
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:50,936
And now...

24
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,166
Four

25
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,446
No, it is not

26
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,470
You certainly have four persons Why?

27
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,193
There are five persons

28
00:02:00,217 --> 00:02:02,146
But you have four

29
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,170
Look, this person is picking up his soap

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,407
Did you get it?

31
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,438
Oh

32
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,416
Nice talking to you

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,440
Thank you

34
00:02:29,111 --> 00:02:38,625
Fukuzatsu na Kare / A Complicated Man (1966)

35
00:04:02,733 --> 00:04:03,239
How was the NAL service?
I hear it's better than before

36
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:10,803
I saw a good looking crew.

37
00:04:13,175 --> 00:04:15,670
He's tall and smart.

38
00:04:15,694 --> 00:04:18,522
He worked very nicely.

39
00:04:18,546 --> 00:04:20,473
Oh He must be Idohori-kun.

40
00:04:20,497 --> 00:04:21,992
Idohori?

41
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:25,016
He has unusual name.

42
00:04:25,888 --> 00:04:28,888
Judging by his name, is he from Okinawa?

43
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:32,712
You're silly.
That's just his nickname.

44
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,207
His real name is Geroge Miyagi

45
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,419
What? Is it nickname?

46
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,139
What do you wanna eat?

47
00:04:39,163 --> 00:04:40,272
Anything is fine.

48
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,296
Help me.

49
00:04:46,012 --> 00:04:48,955
He's careless guy.

50
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,415
Why?

51
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:53,439
Just call him Idohori

52
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,742
I can't imagine how much he's done bad things so far.

53
00:05:01,313 --> 00:05:04,313
He's good-looking, but when he's broke, he works digging wells.

54
00:05:07,298 --> 00:05:10,298
He got 1000yen to dig 1m.

55
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,483
The rookie dug deep, so he was drenched from head to toe.

56
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:40,166
He ended up to catch a cold.

57
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,808
I didn't know that.

58
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,832
I can't believe he did that job.

59
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:53,146
He even talks about it proudly.

60
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:58,148
Oh yeah.

61
00:05:58,172 --> 00:06:01,172
Didn't you have a relative who worked at the Nihon Shimbun?

62
00:06:03,271 --> 00:06:06,271
He's the brother right above my late mother,
and he's currently the head of the business division, you know.

63
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:10,076
Oh, right, Mr.Suga?

64
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,886
He was the London correspondent, wasn't he?

65
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,910
Nearly ten years ago

66
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:18,485
 I hear that Mr. Ido-bori was wandering around Europe and was taken care of by Mr. Suga.

67
00:06:22,813 --> 00:06:25,813
You might be able to learn something about him.

68
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:35,614
Hang this there.

69
00:06:44,344 --> 00:06:46,106
I'm back

70
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,936
Oh Saeko,Well come back.

71
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,975
Did you have fun?

72
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,023
Yes a lot.

73
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:54,047
Good to know.

74
00:06:55,116 --> 00:06:57,625
Are you holding an exhibition in the UK?

75
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,126
Yes.

76
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:01,399
It's convenience.

77
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,416
Do you know of Miyagi?

78
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,080
Put it there.

79
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,679
Miyagi?
Who?

80
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:10,703
He's flight attendant.

81
00:07:12,109 --> 00:07:14,458
He's crew for NAL

82
00:07:14,482 --> 00:07:16,411
He lived in London

83
00:07:16,435 --> 00:07:19,435
London?

84
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:23,773
Oh he must be George

85
00:07:24,168 --> 00:07:27,131
I heard you took care of him very much.

86
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,155
It was not much.

87
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:34,878
He studied at Wimbledon University,

88
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:39,452
He was expelled for some reason.

89
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,376
He came to me way,

90
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,400
He came to the London branch office near Big Ben.

91
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,874
Are you promising to be a camera assistant at home
and work diligently?

92
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:04,421
Yes, I'll do my absolute best.

93
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,525
By the way, what's your favorite thing?

94
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:13,381
Yes, it's a girl.

95
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:17,631
You're honest.

96
00:08:18,299 --> 00:08:21,299
I'm sick and tired of Japanese people who lie.

97
00:08:23,132 --> 00:08:26,132
Don't think about girl while working.

98
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,498
Sure.

99
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:33,490
So I hired him

100
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:36,514
He spook English well and was well mannered.
He was good to us.

101
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:42,589
He happened to cause an industrial espionage scandal while I was away on a reporting trip.

102
00:08:47,796 --> 00:08:49,329
Did he?

103
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,353
The company is a factory that makes comet machines, and he secretly took photos of the equipment there.

104
00:08:55,571 --> 00:08:58,571
There was a risk that this could develop into an international issue.

105
00:08:59,304 --> 00:09:02,304
I asked him like this.

106
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:05,854
Who exactly bought you?

107
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:10,175
Nobody is buying me.

108
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,199
Did you do it of your own volition?

109
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:15,022
No.

110
00:09:15,046 --> 00:09:18,046
Who told you to do that?

111
00:09:18,233 --> 00:09:21,233
Who asked you to do the photo shoot?

112
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:27,866
You can't say it because you feel bad.

113
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,706
OK

114
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,730
You can rest until I get to the truth.

115
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,827
OK?

116
00:09:42,828 --> 00:09:45,828
I was certain he was an accomplice.

117
00:09:46,349 --> 00:09:49,349
After further investigation, I found out that a cameraman, desperate for some pocket money, had accepted the job from a certain businessman.

118
00:09:53,861 --> 00:09:56,861
It turns out that they had disguised it as a company recruitment opportunity and made Miyagi-kun work for free.

119
00:10:01,764 --> 00:10:04,764
So, even though I looked after him, I may be the one responsible for causing him incurable emotional wounds at his most crucial time.

120
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,290
Are you still in a relationship with him?

121
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:20,960
I haven't seen him in a while, but he's very loyal.

122
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:24,874
He called me and asked if I would like to have dinner with him.

123
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:35,248
I think he'll be here soon.

124
00:10:36,404 --> 00:10:39,404
He may suddenly have work to do that requires him to fly.

125
00:10:40,881 --> 00:10:42,248
No way.

126
00:10:42,272 --> 00:10:45,084
He's not a fighter pilot

127
00:10:45,108 --> 00:10:48,108
Welcome.

128
00:10:48,513 --> 00:10:51,513
Welcome.

129
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:52,694
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

130
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,718
You haven't changed at all

131
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,638
I'm sorry I haven't seen you in a long time.

132
00:11:00,662 --> 00:11:03,662
Come in.

133
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:08,069
It's been 10 years since I last saw you

134
00:11:08,623 --> 00:11:10,638
But you haven't changed at all

135
00:11:10,662 --> 00:11:11,996
Not at all.

136
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,361
Ah, take it easy, take it easy.

137
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:14,526
Oh, excuse me

138
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,936
Ah, let me introduce you

139
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,935
She's My niece Saeko Morita

140
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,332
I'm Miyagi

141
00:11:21,356 --> 00:11:24,356
Excuse me, but weren't you in
San Francisco by NAL two weeks ago ?

142
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,311
Yes I was

143
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,586
you remember that well?

144
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,610
I remember most of the passengers.

145
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:39,254
You have an amazing memory

146
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,510
Hey, since it's all ready, please carry it over

147
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,232
Yes

148
00:11:45,256 --> 00:11:47,942
You might be tired of eating tempura by now.

149
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,122
I love it

150
00:11:50,146 --> 00:11:52,656
You can eat it anywhere in the world now

151
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,680
That's right, you liked fish

152
00:11:56,964 --> 00:11:59,826
Whether it's from the sea or the river,I love it.

153
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,850
Do you like the fish in the well?

154
00:12:03,614 --> 00:12:06,614
Fish in the well?

155
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,591
Are there any fish in the well?

156
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,615
Since there is water,
there might be some.

157
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:15,346
haha, I understand now

158
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:17,795
You seem to know various gossip about me

159
00:12:17,819 --> 00:12:18,653
I don't mean that

160
00:12:18,677 --> 00:12:20,306
Oh, it's not good to hide things, you know

161
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,330
I know exactly who said that.

162
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,960
But in this case, I might just confide a secret that I haven't told anyone yet, just to you

163
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:33,982
Can you absolutely keep this secret?

164
00:12:34,246 --> 00:12:37,246
If this gets out I'll be fired

165
00:12:37,518 --> 00:12:40,443
I will keep that secret

166
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:43,467
Right now, I'm out on bail.

167
00:13:01,951 --> 00:13:04,951
What's the hell?

168
00:13:08,115 --> 00:13:11,115
Let's dance

169
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,427
Why did you do something like that?

170
00:13:21,452 --> 00:13:23,319
 Because I was lonely

171
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,280
You shouldn't have the right to do something like that now.

172
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:31,818
Don't make fun of me.

173
00:13:32,439 --> 00:13:33,705
You actually have someone, you know

174
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:38,355
He's been cold lately

175
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,310
It's none of my business.

176
00:13:41,193 --> 00:13:44,209
George, do you remember?

177
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:47,735
In the beginning of us.

178
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Hey George, let's go somewhere tonight

179
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,889
We can't.

180
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,586
You have a husband, don't you?

181
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,474
Don't worry, don't worry

182
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:49,459
You know, we were apart like that four years ago, weren't we?

183
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:52,186
And it was only for a month

184
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,881
I didn't really understand various things back then

185
00:14:57,903 --> 00:15:00,903
Let's dance, George.

186
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:13,045
George.

187
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:17,256
I can't forget you

188
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,553
Don’t do that.

189
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:25,216
Will you go and apologize to her like this?

190
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:28,936
It's none of your business.

191
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,120
You know, it seems you're quite close with her too, huh?

192
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,295
Excuse me.

193
00:15:58,110 --> 00:15:59,676
it was you after all

194
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:00,990
Come in.

195
00:16:10,061 --> 00:16:11,045
Never mind

196
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:20,760
Has the company found out about that?

197
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,716
No, don't worry.

198
00:16:27,155 --> 00:16:31,068
Do you still not want money?

199
00:16:31,662 --> 00:16:32,475
No, not really

200
00:16:33,082 --> 00:16:34,348
What about your position?

201
00:16:35,303 --> 00:16:36,537
It must be boring even if I become important.

202
00:16:37,219 --> 00:16:40,219
It just binds me up because my actions are restricted

203
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:49,350
Meeting a young man like I
feel like taking a refreshing breath

204
00:16:50,355 --> 00:16:54,310
These days, young people are so timid and pathetic

205
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,998
Money, fame, and success

206
00:16:58,531 --> 00:17:01,531
Japan's future looks bleak.

207
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:11,552
Thinking about it, just having someone
like you around enriches my heart

208
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,818
However, I do have a fondness for women

209
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,326
Most failures stem from that

210
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,240
Isn't it quite nice to like women?

211
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,696
You're still young, after all

212
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,412
If your heart is moved, go ahead and enjoy it as much as you like;

213
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:27,287
There will come a time when you get tired of it

214
00:17:27,717 --> 00:17:28,725
You think so?

215
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,256
I've been doing it since I was 16 in England

216
00:17:33,037 --> 00:17:33,709
I can't do that yet

217
00:17:33,925 --> 00:17:36,880
Do as you please

218
00:17:42,255 --> 00:17:43,167
By the way,

219
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,360
Haven't you made up your mind yet?

220
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:49,279
What do you mean?

221
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,974
I told you when I helped you

222
00:17:52,662 --> 00:17:55,631
If I save you, you will follow me

223
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,680
However, I should have firmly declined at that time

224
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,302
Indeed, you refused

225
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,724
But I saved you

226
00:18:09,568 --> 00:18:11,170
I'm grateful for that

227
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:16,084
However, since I declined,

228
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:18,388
your act of saving me
is solely your own will

229
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,842
You're right.

230
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:22,998
So I'm not pushing you

231
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:24,526
but that's fine

232
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,326
Your feelings will probably change eventually

233
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:28,404
I'll come again someday!

234
00:19:15,575 --> 00:19:19,199
Hello, is this Morita's house? Is Saeko there?

235
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:20,733
Saeko?

236
00:19:21,357 --> 00:19:22,537
We don't have anyone named Saeko here

237
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:40,336
Hello, is this Morita's house?

238
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:41,521
Is Saeko there?

239
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm Saeko.

240
00:19:43,579 --> 00:19:45,735
Who?
Kacchan?

241
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,575
Where are you calling from?

242
00:19:48,953 --> 00:19:52,278
If it's from some bed,
I won't accept that

243
00:20:08,145 --> 00:20:09,133
Hello

244
00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:11,146
This is Morita.

245
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:12,786
May I ask who is calling?

246
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,114
This is Miyagi

247
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,372
Is Saeko there?

248
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:20,016
But I believe she has already gone to bed,

249
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,044
so please wait a moment

250
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,161
Hello, is this Saeko?

251
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,091
what? Isn't this Saeko?

252
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:36,286
My sister hasn't come home yet,

253
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:41,850
but no, I am not Saeko.

254
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,575
Is there something urgent?

255
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,317
I will just let my sister know that you called

256
00:21:43,622 --> 00:21:45,895
Hello, is this Suga's home?

257
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:47,872
Yes.

258
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:49,458
I'm George Miyagi

259
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:53,524
Actually, I have a request that I would really like to discuss

260
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,750
No, it's a request for my entire life

261
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:04,370
I'm really sorry for being out so late last night

262
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,340
No, no, I thought that if it continues like that, it wouldn't be just a simple matter

263
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:11,448
I quickly called Saeko out for lunch today

264
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,876
I explained it on your behalf.

265
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,426
Thank you very much.

266
00:22:15,325 --> 00:22:17,876
what did Saeko-san say?

267
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,866
Surprisingly,She was in a good mood

268
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:22,905
So, did she agree to my plan?

269
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,306
I think so.

270
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:25,396
they were even scolded

271
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:31,630
She felt more sorry for the girl who slapped than for the girl who was slapped.

272
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,107
So, about last night's phone call?

273
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,873
It really was Saeko

274
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:45,836
She doesn't have any siblings, you know

275
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,521
But the fact that she went out of her way to answer the phone probably means she wanted to hear your voice, right?

276
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:59,175
Thank you for everything; I really appreciate it. I'm sorry for causing so much trouble, and when I get back,

277
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,026
I will come to express my gratitude eventually,

278
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,052
but I don't have time today,

279
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:08,605
Wait Miyagi-kun, I have something that I brought from Saeko

280
00:23:08,630 --> 00:23:09,584
Thanks.

281
00:23:12,607 --> 00:23:14,224
You don't read?

282
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:17,404
I will read it on the plane

283
00:23:17,935 --> 00:23:19,630
Thank you very much for your repeated kindness

284
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,622
Well, Saeko

285
00:23:46,732 --> 00:23:48,865
What on earth does this mean?

286
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:52,942
You called me to Haneda all the way to Haneda

287
00:23:53,591 --> 00:23:54,459
Sorry.

288
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,406
just to see him off?

289
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,552
I don't mean that.

290
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,912
Just something.

291
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:03,427
It seems you have something to discuss

292
00:24:04,293 --> 00:24:07,950
shall we have a drink somewhere cool and talk about it in detail?

293
00:24:09,138 --> 00:24:12,177
However, I have guests coming over to my place today.

294
00:24:12,521 --> 00:24:13,566
I have to hurry home

295
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,766
that's a busy matter

296
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,186
Is it one of Dad's customers?

297
00:24:17,218 --> 00:24:23,192
No, it's the Indian lady I met at my Arab embassy party

298
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,200
Shall I send it to you?

299
00:24:25,777 --> 00:24:26,762
Thank you very much.

300
00:24:32,557 --> 00:24:35,557
I've completely forgotten about yesterday

301
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,028
Please don't worry

302
00:24:39,803 --> 00:24:42,803
If we have the chance to meet again,

303
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,400
I believe we will surely have a fun conversation then

304
00:24:47,762 --> 00:24:50,762
Morita Saeko, Dear Idohori

305
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:55,748
what are you doing, grinning to yourself?

306
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,185
I see, it's a love letter

307
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,145
Do you need another glass of wine?

308
00:25:02,909 --> 00:25:06,099
how about going for a swim after we land in Honolulu?

309
00:25:06,326 --> 00:25:08,170
Sounds good!
I want to go surfing for the first time in a while.

310
00:25:10,562 --> 00:25:11,536
but you should really give it up

311
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:15,344
Why? You're a strange person

312
00:25:16,966 --> 00:25:17,732
Please.

313
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,408
Thank you very much.

314
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:33,271
Actually, there was someone I wanted to meet when I came to Japan

315
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:39,903
It's someone I met at a nightclub in Cairo

316
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,724
I was watching from the back seat inside the tent

317
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,357
A foreigner sat next to me

318
00:26:20,388 --> 00:26:21,942
He looked very lonely

319
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:37,302
That person was a boy on a Japanese ship, and his name was George Miyagi

320
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:40,317
Huh? Miyagi?

321
00:26:40,779 --> 00:26:41,404
 Yes

322
00:26:42,082 --> 00:26:47,310
And then suddenly, he became restless and called the boy

323
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,755
When he stood up to leave

324
00:27:00,857 --> 00:27:04,232
that turned into.....

325
00:27:05,115 --> 00:27:05,966
I see

326
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,192
If you don't mind, please tell me more

327
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:22,068
Idohori!

328
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,415
Hey, how are you?

329
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:32,296
It's been a while

330
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,072
When did you arrive?

331
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:34,224
I came yesterday

332
00:27:35,427 --> 00:27:36,293
Aren't you going to join us?

333
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,259
Are you in a hurry?

334
00:27:39,478 --> 00:27:40,169
Not really,

335
00:27:40,795 --> 00:27:43,361
then it's fine. Let's have some coffee

336
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:44,224
Yeah.

337
00:27:50,403 --> 00:27:52,245
By the way, how's everything going?

338
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,196
I'm doing well

339
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,266
I actually have a surprisingly domestic side

340
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:57,134
And my husband loves me too,

341
00:27:57,657 --> 00:27:58,789
so that's great

342
00:27:59,339 --> 00:28:02,115
But I guess you're bored in the banking job

343
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:04,836
 that's the thing—my husband is really dedicated to his work,

344
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,044
When clients from the main office come,

345
00:28:06,258 --> 00:28:10,067
he shows them around, and if they don't come, he gathers his subordinates at home

346
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:15,293
I'm always in a flurry, but I don't mind because there's no such ideal husband

347
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,528
He's kind and considerate

348
00:28:18,553 --> 00:28:21,372
I can't believe I came all the way to San Francisco to hear your boasting

349
00:28:21,576 --> 00:28:23,212
What about you?

350
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:24,107
Me?

351
00:28:24,857 --> 00:28:26,599
Are you hunting women?

352
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:33,110
I'm actually in love right now

353
00:28:33,261 --> 00:28:34,927
In love? Who is it?

354
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:37,646
Is it someone from the same company?

355
00:28:38,574 --> 00:28:39,357
No, it's not like that

356
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,325
Could it be that person is SM?

357
00:28:45,591 --> 00:28:46,873
SM...

358
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,630
that's right, exactly

359
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,880
So it was Saeko after all

360
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:56,106
But why would you say that?

361
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,786
It's obvious, isn't it?

362
00:28:58,833 --> 00:29:02,536
She was a classmate from college and I met her last month.

363
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,426
So it was you after all

364
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:07,450
You were the one who taught her about well digging

365
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:16,565
But you didn't tell her my secret, did you?

366
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:17,748
What secret?

367
00:29:18,113 --> 00:29:19,800
Don't tease me.

368
00:29:19,894 --> 00:29:23,638
You and I had a fight and broke up

369
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,020
but I haven't even talked about that with anyone at the company

370
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,846
It's the bare minimum of etiquette towards you, isn't it?

371
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,706
If that's the case, I appreciate it

372
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:34,730
Of course, you haven't mentioned this to Saeko, right?

373
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:36,692
Of course, I swear.

374
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:40,114
Is that so? Thank you

375
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:51,935
There's no need to say thank you. it's just that I haven't talked yet

376
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,013
Are you talking about an exchange?

377
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:55,763
Yes.

378
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,333
money?

379
00:29:59,263 --> 00:30:00,575
Don't underestimate, okay?

380
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,976
I have more money than you

381
00:30:04,466 --> 00:30:06,000
Well, think it over carefully

382
00:30:06,115 --> 00:30:07,700
Other than the money

383
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,591
But you are married.

384
00:30:10,841 --> 00:30:12,286
It's none of your business.

385
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,724
I just want to steal you away for a bit

386
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,114
At this point, I don't really want any affection

387
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:28,193
You intend to tell Saeko-san about this deal, do you?

388
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,763
Do you think I'm such a cowardly woman?

389
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,186
We are fair now.

390
00:31:56,483 --> 00:31:57,405
What do you mean?

391
00:31:58,503 --> 00:32:00,076
The deal is done, right?

392
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:08,467
But still, the one who has the advantage is you, holding onto my secret

393
00:32:09,543 --> 00:32:11,506
Men's reasoning is so simple, isn't it?

394
00:32:13,296 --> 00:32:14,389
It's not like that.

395
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:21,537
I've created a secret that I absolutely want you to protect

396
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:23,818
For your husband?

397
00:32:24,966 --> 00:32:25,725
For Saeko

398
00:32:27,397 --> 00:32:28,311
For Saeko?

399
00:32:29,048 --> 00:32:33,139
Promise me that you will never tell Saeko about this

400
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:27,350
I never expected you to come out so honestly

401
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,007
it's quite ironic?

402
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:31,733
Oh no, that's not

403
00:33:32,065 --> 00:33:33,280
we made your tea.

404
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:39,553
Come in

405
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:45,772
Shall I bring your meal right away?

406
00:33:45,813 --> 00:33:46,449
Please do that

407
00:33:46,593 --> 00:33:47,350
How about drink?

408
00:33:47,566 --> 00:33:48,639
A beer would be fine?

409
00:33:48,757 --> 00:33:49,038
Yes

410
00:33:49,287 --> 00:33:50,483
I understood

411
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,600
What is this?

412
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:01,819
This is a small stone from the river

413
00:34:02,117 --> 00:34:03,381
I picked it up because it's pretty

414
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:14,279
The other day, I invited a lady from India
named Madam Zaruzaru to my house, you know?

415
00:34:15,489 --> 00:34:18,489
I heard something from her at that time

416
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,420
A love romance that lasts just one night with you

417
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:34,490
I heard you might have gotten married

418
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,446
So, is she in Japan?

419
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:38,436
Do you want to see her?

420
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:40,458
I guess so

421
00:34:42,438 --> 00:34:46,272
But I feel like it's better to leave old memories undisturbed

422
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,858
So, can you endure it?

423
00:34:48,866 --> 00:34:49,624
Yes, I can.

424
00:34:52,161 --> 00:34:55,161
I envy men.....

425
00:35:01,827 --> 00:35:05,514
for being able to cut off their past so easily

426
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:08,529
Do you have a past too?

427
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:12,426
You shouldn't treat me like a child

428
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,678
I apologize for that

429
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:17,170
From a woman's perspective,

430
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,116
I think if the other person were to cut
off the past, you might seem insincere,

431
00:35:23,991 --> 00:35:24,883
but that's not the case.

432
00:35:25,892 --> 00:35:26,899
Excuse me.

433
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:42,336
I wonder what happened

434
00:35:42,446 --> 00:35:45,066
This area sometimes has a strong wind blows

435
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:07,321
I'll take care of it.

436
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,227
You seem like a mysterious person, don't you think?Yes,

437
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,610
Me?

438
00:36:26,321 --> 00:36:26,947
why?

439
00:36:27,798 --> 00:36:30,196
I think you're a very complex person

440
00:36:30,517 --> 00:36:33,123
To me, there's nothing mysterious at all

441
00:36:35,031 --> 00:36:39,758
Still, I believe it's better to have a little mystery, whether you're a man or a woman

442
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,156
No, but I've actually suffered losses because of that until now

443
00:36:42,414 --> 00:36:42,653
But

444
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:43,657
it's really true

445
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,916
I've lived my life naturally as I felt since I was a child

446
00:36:47,024 --> 00:36:49,676
But that becomes a mystery to everyone, which is a problem for me

447
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,886
Because there are no connections to my past at all,

448
00:36:52,094 --> 00:36:54,910
it seems that people think I'm a silly and extraordinary guy,

449
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:57,306
but that actually troubles me as well

450
00:36:57,331 --> 00:37:00,331
it's true

451
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:07,462
I'm sorry.

452
00:37:10,274 --> 00:37:11,945
You tried so hard to excuse yourself.

453
00:37:13,188 --> 00:37:13,820
Is that bad?

454
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:16,368
Because it feels like you
were being a spoiled child

455
00:37:16,629 --> 00:37:18,383
Yes, I'm a brat.

456
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,548
It's not good.

457
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:42,024
I wanted to see you.

458
00:37:44,755 --> 00:37:48,727
I was scared that if I couldn't see you,

459
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:54,235
I felt like I was going to be no good for some reason.

460
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,408
Well, I'm going to take my leave now

461
00:38:14,873 --> 00:38:15,799
Are you heading home?

462
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,072
Huh? That's too bad

463
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,907
Then let me see you off

464
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,752
I'll see you again before you board.

465
00:38:27,963 --> 00:38:28,909
So, tomorrow,

466
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,252
so early?

467
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:34,665
It's not tomorrow to board, but I can't wait, is that okay?

468
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:35,987
Alright.

469
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:38,211
then I'll go settle the bill for a bit

470
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:41,440
Oh, you forgot the apples.

471
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:00,432
Saeko?

472
00:39:00,565 --> 00:39:00,948
Yes

473
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:07,603
I'm sorry for being late

474
00:39:09,212 --> 00:39:10,451
Where have you been?

475
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,900
I was treated to dinner by my uncle

476
00:39:16,793 --> 00:39:19,793
Well, let's go. You lied to Papa for the first time, didn't you?

477
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,752
I called Mr. Suga

478
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:31,838
Well, it's fine. You're old enough to take responsibility now

479
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,330
I believe in you

480
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,606
The meal is ready

481
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:39,806
She said she had already eaten her meal

482
00:39:42,846 --> 00:39:43,924
I see.

483
00:39:45,276 --> 00:39:51,783
Actually, I suddenly have to go to Rio de Janeiro as a representative of the industry

484
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:55,592
And I would like you to accompany me again

485
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,076
Well, when?

486
00:39:58,268 --> 00:39:59,627
It's quite sudden,
you see

487
00:39:59,858 --> 00:40:02,164
If we don't leave the day after tomorrow, we won't make it

488
00:40:02,189 --> 00:40:03,345
So until when? Huh?

489
00:40:04,237 --> 00:40:07,237
It might take almost a month

490
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:11,713
That long? That's a problem for me

491
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:17,103
Have a nice day.

492
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:33,698
Are you Mr. Morita's daughter?

493
00:40:34,463 --> 00:40:35,002
Yes.

494
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:39,902
then you know Miyagi-kun, right?

495
00:40:41,393 --> 00:40:42,096
What's wrong?

496
00:40:43,618 --> 00:40:45,196
Well then, let's talk while we walk

497
00:40:51,345 --> 00:40:54,345
What is your relationship with him?

498
00:40:54,502 --> 00:40:56,659
I don't have a deep relationship with him

499
00:40:56,694 --> 00:40:58,650
You haven't seen him that much yet.

500
00:40:59,026 --> 00:40:59,580
No

501
00:41:01,077 --> 00:41:05,212
A young man like him is quite rare these days

502
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,822
Once he decides he wants to do something,

503
00:41:10,466 --> 00:41:15,033
he pursues it wholeheartedly without worrying about what others think

504
00:41:15,933 --> 00:41:19,135
It might sound like he's a very simple man,

505
00:41:19,871 --> 00:41:25,510
but on the other hand, he is quite sensitive to feelings and has a surprisingly sentimental side

506
00:41:26,949 --> 00:41:31,556
In a nutshell, you could say he's a manly man

507
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:35,432
Anyway, it's a waste to leave him as just a purser

508
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,986
Well, no matter what anyone says

509
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:51,675
What Japan is most lacking right now is neither money nor goods

510
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:54,252
It is precisely human resources

511
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:57,740
Just like Miyagi-kun

512
00:41:58,704 --> 00:42:02,385
Do you know him very well?

513
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,996
I think I know Miyagi-san

514
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,406
The important thing is that

515
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:14,564
he is currently in the middle of hunting

516
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:18,490
So, it really is true that he is in the middle of hunting, isn't it?

517
00:42:19,057 --> 00:42:21,221
he is in the middle of hunting?

518
00:42:22,629 --> 00:42:26,207
Legally, it should be referred to as a suspended sentence,

519
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:31,707
but it seems he prefers the term 'in the midst of predation.'

520
00:42:32,110 --> 00:42:36,254
In any case, it's just a matter of waiting one more year for divine judgment

521
00:42:40,395 --> 00:42:42,199
Why did he end up in this situation?

522
00:42:43,927 --> 00:42:47,659
Because he was caught for illegal handling of a disability and a pistol

523
00:42:48,582 --> 00:42:49,144
When?

524
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:52,668
It's been a little over three years now

525
00:42:53,588 --> 00:42:58,027
At that time, he was working as a bartender at A bar in Yokohama

526
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,613
A night.

527
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:35,238
He heard from one customer that he was troubled because a bad foreigner had defaulted on nearly 10 million yen

528
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:46,430
He went to where the foreigners were and argued with them in English.

529
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:58,000
But the foreigners outnumbered him, so he was overwhelmed.

530
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,880
It happened while he was being transported somewhere in a car.

531
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:09,719
Don't move.

532
00:44:41,657 --> 00:44:45,180
That was good up to there

533
00:44:46,164 --> 00:44:48,974
but the next morning,
the police came to his lodging,

534
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:53,984
and as a result,
it ended up in court

535
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,126
You know quite a lot of detailed things, don't you?

536
00:44:57,237 --> 00:45:01,156
Well, I had a lawyer assigned to him, you see

537
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,126
You?

538
00:45:02,150 --> 00:45:03,226
That's right

539
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:09,726
He's a man worth doing that much for with pleasure

540
00:45:10,806 --> 00:45:15,453
Well, I just tent to chatter away without thinking, so excuse me

541
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:36,328
Sorry for keeping you waiting

542
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,422
What would you like to drink?

543
00:45:41,243 --> 00:45:42,586
I'm not in the mood to drink

544
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:48,140
What are you thinking?

545
00:45:50,226 --> 00:45:54,335
I was just wondering where you would take me today

546
00:45:54,563 --> 00:45:57,563
Well, I haven't decided yet either

547
00:45:57,702 --> 00:46:03,656
Shall we go to Jindaiji, or would it be more
stylish to stretch a bit further to Tamabochi?

548
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:05,773
Do you like cemeteries?

549
00:46:06,328 --> 00:46:07,368
 hat sounds nice.

550
00:46:07,786 --> 00:46:09,862
it makes me feel like we could live twice as long,

551
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:12,286
just like the Buddhas

552
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,742
If young people go, they'll surely be happy

553
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:32,922
Walking like this, it feels like we're looking for an apartment together,

554
00:46:34,914 --> 00:46:36,508
A place we could live in forever?

555
00:46:50,067 --> 00:46:54,779
I suddenly decided to go to Brazil

556
00:46:57,865 --> 00:46:59,386
Huh? What are you going there for?

557
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:01,537
I'm going to help my father

558
00:47:02,377 --> 00:47:03,170
When?

559
00:47:04,026 --> 00:47:04,861
Tomorrow

560
00:47:06,061 --> 00:47:10,194
and I might end up staying there for almost a month,

561
00:47:13,787 --> 00:47:14,725
for almost a month

562
00:47:26,634 --> 00:47:28,451
but I really don't want to go

563
00:47:30,826 --> 00:47:32,450
but this time his the last trip,

564
00:47:33,396 --> 00:47:35,306
so he absolutely have to take you with me

565
00:47:39,587 --> 00:47:42,587
It's so terrible that I can't see you for a month.

566
00:47:47,014 --> 00:47:49,592
My heart aches too

567
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,483
It's tough for me too.

568
00:47:55,430 --> 00:47:57,546
It's awful that things have turned out this way

569
00:47:57,577 --> 00:48:00,577
I won't let you go as it is either

570
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,514
I don't care what happens

571
00:48:12,037 --> 00:48:13,061
I think you feel the same way.

572
00:48:14,957 --> 00:48:17,957
Let's be alone somewhere.

573
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:21,811
We can't do that.

574
00:48:27,721 --> 00:48:30,721
That's your company's airplane? Huh?

575
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,326
No, that's not it

576
00:48:35,242 --> 00:48:36,631
That's a U.S. military fighter jet

577
00:48:38,033 --> 00:48:43,662
So, they might go to Vietnam someday, huh?

578
00:48:44,625 --> 00:48:49,717
Well, compared to that, I have to endure it

579
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,795
Even if I can't see you for about a month,

580
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,248
won't you send me a letter?

581
00:48:58,811 --> 00:48:59,483
Sure.

582
00:49:13,022 --> 00:49:14,346
Is there something I can help you?

583
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,185
No

584
00:49:35,084 --> 00:49:36,514
This is a letter for you

585
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,662
Thank you

586
00:49:58,373 --> 00:49:59,178
We met again

587
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,476
To San Francisco?

588
00:50:13,592 --> 00:50:14,123
Yes

589
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:20,116
Let's go that way

590
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,240
I'm so happy

591
00:50:35,543 --> 00:50:37,409
because I didn't expect this

592
00:50:38,178 --> 00:50:40,474
I didn't think we would meet
like this either

593
00:50:41,584 --> 00:50:43,246
When I found out I could take this flight

594
00:50:43,271 --> 00:50:47,710
To be honest, I was wondering what to do being in first place, unable to even talk to you

595
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,170
Just looking at your face is too painful

596
00:51:35,482 --> 00:51:36,705
Oh, what's wrong?

597
00:51:36,834 --> 00:51:38,069
No, it's nothing

598
00:51:48,013 --> 00:51:49,165
By the way, what are you going to do?

599
00:51:49,190 --> 00:51:51,636
I have to go out for business,

600
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:54,847
but I'll be down writing letters or something

601
00:51:56,306 --> 00:52:01,404
Mr. George, I saw your illusion today

602
00:52:02,873 --> 00:52:04,338
In front of the hotel,

603
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,816
wearing a brown suit,

604
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:11,326
I couldn't help but exclaim, and my father became suspicious of me

605
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,693
Rio is a beautiful city

606
00:52:23,137 --> 00:52:26,724
Blue sea and white sand

607
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,365
People who are close to each other everywhere

608
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:37,857
It seems like everyone in this town is in love

609
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:44,990
How happy I would be if I were with you

610
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:55,481
Hello,

611
00:52:56,373 --> 00:52:58,412
how did you manage to come all the way here?

612
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,881
If I want to meet you, there's no place I can't reach

613
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:04,498
Is your job okay?

614
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,836
I took a week off forcefully

615
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:10,986
So, I asked a friend from the airline here
to arrange the tickets up to this point

616
00:53:12,685 --> 00:53:13,912
Well, what did you write?

617
00:53:14,528 --> 00:53:16,216
A letter for you

618
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:19,506
Don't see it.

619
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:20,209
Why?

620
00:53:20,909 --> 00:53:23,909
It's still unfinished.

621
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:25,645
You are here,

622
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,193
why not just say it out loud?

623
00:53:28,217 --> 00:53:29,037
Come on.

624
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,756
Well, Rio is a beautiful city

625
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,326
And then?

626
00:53:36,568 --> 00:53:41,709
How happy I would be if I were with you.

627
00:53:45,365 --> 00:53:46,607
I'm the same way

628
00:53:49,334 --> 00:53:50,721
We can meet for a full five days, you know

629
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:54,271
But I wonder what my father's schedule looks like

630
00:53:54,897 --> 00:53:58,146
Well, I guess that's a problem

631
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:01,275
I came all the way here thinking I would guide you,

632
00:54:01,503 --> 00:54:04,092
but let's go out for now

633
00:54:04,506 --> 00:54:06,967
I'll bring my jacket so please wait.

634
00:54:23,167 --> 00:54:25,020
I'll think about this.

635
00:54:26,021 --> 00:54:28,497
You could become my long-lost friend

636
00:54:29,909 --> 00:54:35,171
And if we say we just happened to meet in Rio, I can formally introduce you to my father.

637
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:36,996
No way!
Don't tell such lies.

638
00:54:38,996 --> 00:54:41,356
He took break.

639
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,380
Idobori-kun is really into her.

640
00:54:44,745 --> 00:54:48,746
I can imagine there are quite a few people in my
circle who would be disappointed to hear this rumor

641
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,926
Are you one of them?

642
00:54:54,109 --> 00:54:58,197
Not at all, he's fine as long as we're just dating

643
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:01,576
I'll find a good person eventually, just like you

644
00:55:09,941 --> 00:55:14,039
Well then, it's in front of the gate at 1 o'clock tomorrow

645
00:55:33,026 --> 00:55:34,677
It's better to write the letter later

646
00:55:35,357 --> 00:55:36,450
Oh, just a little bit

647
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:37,756
That's not good

648
00:55:38,227 --> 00:55:41,646
It's disappointing that they came all this way to represent the industry

649
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,536
Ah, I understand, I understand

650
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,638
I'm going now

651
00:55:54,993 --> 00:55:56,091
Have a good time

652
00:56:59,694 --> 00:57:01,038
Stop it....

653
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:02,039
Saeko.

654
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,853
I was really scared

655
00:57:51,290 --> 00:57:53,315
After all, I didn't understand the words

656
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,896
and I was wondering what to do

657
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,856
But I'm glad we met

658
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,650
But I didn't know you were that strong

659
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:05,079
I was bad boy in old day

660
00:58:05,659 --> 00:58:07,227
Did you used to fight a lot?

661
00:58:07,252 --> 00:58:08,205
No, that's not it

662
00:58:10,245 --> 00:58:11,311
I was doing boxing

663
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:14,356
Well, when? Where?

664
00:58:21,246 --> 00:58:23,585
It was at a camp in
Tachikawa

665
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:25,516
I fought against an American

666
00:58:25,866 --> 00:58:29,928
That's also a fixed match set up for me to lose by knockout, isn't it?

667
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,956
I also hated the idea of a fixed match,

668
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,666
but I couldn't win against obligation

669
00:58:34,836 --> 00:58:37,276
I reluctantly took it on

670
00:58:38,180 --> 00:58:43,835
Around that time, I had a passionate patriot fan at the Western-style bakery in Tachikawa

671
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:58,213
She had no idea it was a fixed match

672
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:07,930
George, I don't want you to lose, so do your best!

673
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:09,804
If I lose, I might die.

674
00:59:15,914 --> 00:59:18,167
 probably due to the frustration of being toyed with by American soldiers on a daily basis

675
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:21,730
She wanted to let it all out with my victory, right?

676
01:00:08,470 --> 01:00:11,470
George, you did it! I'm so happy

677
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:16,517
What's wrong?

678
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:24,323
What happened all of a sudden?

679
01:00:25,779 --> 01:00:28,779
But that woman was beautiful, wasn't she?

680
01:00:32,542 --> 01:00:33,229
You are stupid.

681
01:00:45,005 --> 01:00:48,153
What happened after quitting boxing?

682
01:00:48,377 --> 01:00:49,753
I did various things

683
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,980
Boat racer,The bellboy at hotel

684
01:00:53,876 --> 01:00:56,109
Bar staff etc

685
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,434
How about bartender?

686
01:01:02,704 --> 01:01:03,521
Yes, I did

687
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:05,666
Before joining  in NAL

688
01:01:07,691 --> 01:01:10,196
You knew that I used to work
as a bartender

689
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:14,100
Oh, that was just a guess

690
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,338
Oh, I have to go home now.

691
01:01:19,395 --> 01:01:19,902
Really?

692
01:01:20,646 --> 01:01:23,646
because my father.....

693
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:26,907
I'm sorry

694
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:30,094
It's fine

695
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:34,340
Well then, I'll be waiting in the hotel lobby tomorrow

696
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:38,094
If we meet there, we shouldn't miss each other like today,

697
01:01:39,804 --> 01:01:40,838
and around one o'clock would be good

698
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:41,865
I get it.

699
01:02:34,464 --> 01:02:35,581
I was surprised

700
01:02:35,606 --> 01:02:36,489
I'm sorry.

701
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:39,836
My father just wouldn't go out, so I was quite anxious about it

702
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,860
I thought you might go out together too,

703
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,326
so I was a bit flustered at the entrance

704
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:47,350
I suddenly got a headache

705
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,260
I see, let's go out today

706
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:52,856
I'll show you the face of Corcovado

707
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:53,481
Yes

708
01:04:05,094 --> 01:04:06,760
this is the apartment I'm renting

709
01:04:07,466 --> 01:04:10,449
It's more economical than a hotel if it's for a week

710
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:17,826
Well, I can't go

711
01:04:18,086 --> 01:04:19,140
Why not?

712
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:22,647
I can't go

713
01:04:24,710 --> 01:04:25,243
Why not?

714
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:32,562
I can't enter your room until I get married

715
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:35,342
You're saying that again, huh?

716
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,699
Tomorrow, Meet my father to get approve our marriage

717
01:04:43,591 --> 01:04:46,510
I can't enter your room until I get married

718
01:04:49,078 --> 01:04:50,188
So just understand

719
01:04:51,579 --> 01:04:58,091
I want to go to your room without any worries

720
01:04:59,553 --> 01:05:01,019
What if your Dad says no?

721
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:04,847
I won't let him say that

722
01:05:05,997 --> 01:05:06,637
How can you do that?

723
01:05:08,234 --> 01:05:12,627
I will definitely make him understand
by tonight, no matter how long it takes

724
01:05:13,332 --> 01:05:14,013
So

725
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,144
I understand,

726
01:05:32,452 --> 01:05:33,076
I'm sorry about that

727
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:34,396
I'm being selfish,

728
01:06:07,144 --> 01:06:07,777
Dad.

729
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:12,274
I have a request for you

730
01:06:40,378 --> 01:06:43,442
Hello, could you please talk to Mr. George ?

731
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,542
What? He's not there?

732
01:06:49,223 --> 01:06:52,824
Really? Thank you very much

733
01:06:56,627 --> 01:06:57,762
What's wrong?

734
01:06:58,499 --> 01:07:01,266
You don't mean he's already moved out, do you?

735
01:08:43,484 --> 01:08:46,701
Hello? Oh, George? When did you come?

736
01:08:47,745 --> 01:08:49,849
I really want to see you.

737
01:08:51,562 --> 01:08:52,822
Wait for me at our usual spot

738
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,775
Stay way

739
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,331
You are cold

740
01:09:36,824 --> 01:09:37,651
What's wrong?

741
01:09:38,736 --> 01:09:40,114
Nothing's wrong at all

742
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:48,047
You're cold, it's like you've changed

743
01:09:49,367 --> 01:09:51,153
What about Saeko?

744
01:09:52,768 --> 01:09:53,997
You've already gotten tired of her, huh?

745
01:09:54,128 --> 01:09:55,496
It doesn't really matter, does it?

746
01:09:56,137 --> 01:09:57,643
I guess I was better after all

747
01:09:58,673 --> 01:10:00,963
If that's the case, I wouldn't mind being with you

748
01:10:06,372 --> 01:10:09,372
I've been thinking for a long time about whether I should break up with my partner

749
01:10:10,520 --> 01:10:13,520
If only you had that idea

750
01:10:15,473 --> 01:10:20,336
George, I'll let your secret wife know, ok?

751
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:22,914
Do whatever you like, I don't care

752
01:10:25,665 --> 01:10:26,672
George.

753
01:10:31,544 --> 01:10:33,350
we've talked quite a bit about it

754
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,606
It seems that Dad has completely lost his emotions

755
01:10:38,946 --> 01:10:42,745
I also provided a detailed explanation about Miyagi-kun's character

756
01:10:44,372 --> 01:10:46,831
The reason he didn't show up at the hotel

757
01:10:47,098 --> 01:10:48,835
Because he has something to hide,

758
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,571
that's for sure, He thinks like that.

759
01:10:52,065 --> 01:10:57,628
Anyway, putting that aside, I think I will try to meet George once, what do you think?

760
01:11:10,965 --> 01:11:11,569
Come in.

761
01:11:21,889 --> 01:11:22,609
You're here.

762
01:11:24,249 --> 01:11:25,650
I thought you would come

763
01:11:28,775 --> 01:11:30,749
That's quite a power-saving approach

764
01:11:31,861 --> 01:11:35,822
What were you thinking in such a dark room
without turning on the lights?

765
01:11:37,846 --> 01:11:40,163
I suppose everyone already knows that, right?

766
01:11:41,737 --> 01:11:42,944
Well, that's true

767
01:11:48,325 --> 01:11:49,345
By the way

768
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:55,115
You came here thinking that today I
would finally make up my mind, didn't you?

769
01:11:55,299 --> 01:11:56,618
I can understand at least that much

770
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,108
Actually, you came at a good time

771
01:12:03,466 --> 01:12:05,652
I always come at the right moment in life.

772
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:13,996
There is such a thing as the right timing, and I don't let it slip away

773
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:20,763
It's not easy to patiently wait for that right moment to come

774
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:26,384
But you are a person who is worth enough for me to do that

775
01:12:27,966 --> 01:12:28,919
It's pointless that you praise me.

776
01:12:29,436 --> 01:12:33,880
I truly believe that, of course, that person too.

777
01:12:39,134 --> 01:12:39,840
Who?

778
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,143
Well, it's not the time to mention the name yet

779
01:12:44,557 --> 01:12:45,244
But

780
01:12:58,183 --> 01:12:59,817
can you really just watch in silence?

781
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:07,389
He is deeply in love with you.

782
01:13:08,116 --> 01:13:11,116
That person is deeply pained by the recent conflicts among the same ethnic group in Asia

783
01:13:13,108 --> 01:13:19,957
He wants to somehow bring peace to this Asia; there is no time to waste

784
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:24,893
Thus, he was able to strengthen his resolve to avoid taking action

785
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:30,047
That person chose you as one of his assistants

786
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:33,796
Could you please speak a little more specifically?

787
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:36,939
It would be best to hear that directly from that person

788
01:13:38,125 --> 01:13:38,871
I understood.

789
01:13:40,535 --> 01:13:43,029
Even though I am not in a position to marry a woman among good house,

790
01:13:44,107 --> 01:13:47,823
I was able to smoothly join NAL company thanks to that person's recommendation

791
01:13:48,145 --> 01:13:49,456
I can say it now,

792
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:50,678
but that's exactly right

793
01:13:52,540 --> 01:13:53,727
I knew it.

794
01:13:55,813 --> 01:13:58,785
Do you value
your life right now?

795
01:13:59,773 --> 01:14:00,419
Right now? Right now

796
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:01,926
Speak frankly

797
01:14:03,612 --> 01:14:04,836
I don't particularly think it's precious

798
01:14:04,963 --> 01:14:06,826
Alright, the time has come

799
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:07,602
What is it?

800
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,586
You've changed your mind.

801
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,267
It can't be helped

802
01:14:15,597 --> 01:14:16,988
Let's acknowledge that I've changed my mind.

803
01:14:31,222 --> 01:14:32,419
I come to your room

804
01:14:35,265 --> 01:14:36,618
There is a guest

805
01:14:37,312 --> 01:14:38,692
Please come in.

806
01:14:50,050 --> 01:14:52,114
Oh, it's nice to see you again.

807
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:17,629
What do you think?

808
01:15:19,173 --> 01:15:23,425
You didn't have the courage to propose to this young lady

809
01:15:23,450 --> 01:15:25,447
I'll show you the reason for that

810
01:15:29,177 --> 01:15:34,873
You took on that burden when you did ship's
laborer

811
01:15:35,518 --> 01:15:42,635
However, just being embarrassed alone
won't communicate anything to others

812
01:15:44,444 --> 01:15:47,375
If you boldly show it, everything will change and
you'll be able to let it go

813
01:15:48,995 --> 01:15:49,709
What do you think?

814
01:16:39,396 --> 01:16:42,396
Now you understand, right?

815
01:16:45,176 --> 01:16:48,176
He is definitely not a careless man who puts on a facade of control

816
01:16:49,143 --> 01:16:50,795
He truly loved you with all his heart

817
01:16:53,466 --> 01:16:57,681
However, he did not have the courage to confess this

818
01:16:58,716 --> 01:17:03,424
His propose will be decline if he did confess about this,

819
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:07,127
he would not be able to accept a marriage proposal

820
01:17:10,345 --> 01:17:15,067
He got a tattoo just because he was young.

821
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:23,800
Youth always seems to carry some
form of punishment later on, doesn't it?

822
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:31,839
However, if you intend to stick with someone like him, that's a different story

823
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,699
George...

824
01:17:40,811 --> 01:17:41,697
what do you think?

825
01:17:43,073 --> 01:17:44,394
Will you follow him?

826
01:17:52,909 --> 01:17:53,583
Yes, I will

827
01:17:55,802 --> 01:17:56,942
Your answer is too quick

828
01:17:58,643 --> 01:18:00,094
Can you think about it a bit more?

829
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:02,032
Okay?

830
01:18:03,793 --> 01:18:06,290
you will also have children

831
01:18:07,460 --> 01:18:10,460
However, children cannot go swimming in the pool with their father

832
01:18:11,303 --> 01:18:14,303
First, will you tell this secret to the child or not?

833
01:18:15,778 --> 01:18:18,764
Will you regret it when that time comes?

834
01:18:22,893 --> 01:18:24,280
I won't regret it at all

835
01:18:25,623 --> 01:18:26,373
I see

836
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:33,468
Right now, you probably love him with pure feelings

837
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:40,300
However, I did take the liberty to look into your upbringing

838
01:18:42,046 --> 01:18:43,728
So, if I may say so,

839
01:18:45,210 --> 01:18:48,210
You won't be able to live with such a tattoo man forever

840
01:18:51,339 --> 01:18:59,387
Will you cherish your dreams with him forever, or live in a long, long disillusionment and suffering?

841
01:19:00,756 --> 01:19:02,991
You are standing at that crossroads right now

842
01:19:09,458 --> 01:19:12,649
What if I say my feelings have been
decided from the very beginning.

843
01:19:13,836 --> 01:19:14,683
What do you mean?

844
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:20,638
I love him.

845
01:19:25,349 --> 01:19:28,349
but  you should go home today.

846
01:19:29,422 --> 01:19:32,756
At least think it over for one more night

847
01:19:34,342 --> 01:19:38,576
And once you've made up your mind, you can come back here again

848
01:19:40,232 --> 01:19:40,826
Even if tomorrow comes

849
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,974
He won't run away or hide

850
01:19:43,622 --> 01:19:45,587
I promise you firmly.

851
01:19:48,412 --> 01:19:50,666
Even after thinking about it all night,

852
01:19:50,690 --> 01:19:52,356
my feelings won't change

853
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:58,501
In that case, it means that your love for him is genuine

854
01:20:00,532 --> 01:20:02,473
Please go home.

855
01:20:09,213 --> 01:20:12,887
He will probably be waiting for you to come tomorrow

856
01:20:46,804 --> 01:20:48,150
She is going home.

857
01:20:49,793 --> 01:20:51,332
It's someone you will never meet again

858
01:20:54,356 --> 01:20:55,359
Come here and see her

859
01:20:57,723 --> 01:20:59,087
That's enough now

860
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:04,705
Just hearing her words makes me satisfied

861
01:21:06,853 --> 01:21:10,511
I understand very well that I can't make her happy.

862
01:21:13,189 --> 01:21:18,755
For the first time in my life, I truly loved her.

863
01:21:20,701 --> 01:21:22,867
But if truly loving
someone is this painful,

864
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:26,702
I never want to go through something this painful again

865
01:21:29,219 --> 01:21:30,065
Never.

866
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:33,352
That's right.

867
01:21:36,734 --> 01:21:40,400
You've graduated from the world of women

868
01:21:41,983 --> 01:21:45,692
From today, a life of battles and adventures begins before you

869
01:21:46,574 --> 01:21:47,940
for the Asian people.

870
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:52,558
Come on, let's pack our bags.

871
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:56,810
Let's move out here and go to that person

872
01:21:59,274 --> 01:22:00,114
You don't like it?

873
01:22:02,563 --> 01:22:05,563
No, the bags are already ready

874
01:22:07,496 --> 01:22:09,206
I intended to do that from the very beginning as well.

875
01:22:39,755 --> 01:22:41,474
Let's go.

876
01:23:32,739 --> 01:23:40,857
THE END

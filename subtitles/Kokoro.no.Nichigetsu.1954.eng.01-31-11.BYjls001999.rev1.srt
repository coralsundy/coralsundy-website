00:00:12,617 --> 00:00:22,293
<i>Kokoro no Nichigetsu (1954)</i>

3
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,718
I've tried to look around, but there's no sleeping seat.

4
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:30,788
Can't find one?

5
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,842
Really?

6
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:34,825
It's fine now.

7
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:35,829
Thank you for your hard work.

8
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:44,073
but it's not good.
I want you to have a rest.

9
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,242
Don't call me Madam.

10
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:49,914
That's what I always say.

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,157
This is bad card.

12
00:02:54,903 --> 00:02:56,684
Don't be loud.

13
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,376
There are passengers.

14
00:02:59,325 --> 00:03:00,471
Where's my card?

15
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:03,079
Where has it gone?

16
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:05,616
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:08,082
Here it is.

18
00:03:08,716 --> 00:03:10,577
Yes this is.

19
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,684
I hate this card.

20
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,911
I'm sorry for being so noisy, really.

21
00:03:20,538 --> 00:03:22,175
Eri-chan, let's stop now

22
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,720
You get excited too easily, so that's not good

23
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,307
Riding the train is tiring

24
00:03:33,873 --> 00:03:37,200
What time do we arrive?

25
00:03:37,668 --> 00:03:40,023
We'll be arrived at 9:30

26
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,949
Would you like to have this?

27
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,652
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:54,745 --> 00:03:55,302
Eri-chan, but you're too weak to do anything

29
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,835
You're too lazy.

30
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:07,728
You really need to sleep better.

31
00:04:08,824 --> 00:04:13,246
I apologize for the inconvenience, but she had a drink before getting on.

32
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,196
Oh, Eri-chan, you are too heavy.

33
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,670
This person is causing trouble, so please sit here.

34
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:26,002
Eri-chan, it would be rude to lean against her.

35
00:04:26,177 --> 00:04:27,341
Don't worry.

36
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,957
This space is available, please.

37
00:04:40,075 --> 00:04:41,948
I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience.

38
00:04:42,754 --> 00:04:45,175
I shouldn't have brought someone like her.

39
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,015
I was persistently told that I should definitely take her to Osaka.

40
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,735
Osaka is a lively place, isn't it?

41
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:56,324
Where did you board from?

42
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,589
From Okayama

43
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:03,016
Okayama?

44
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,836
Speaking of Okayama,Rice is famous.

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,992
Where to?

46
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:11,359
Tokyo.

47
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,117
Well, I'm glad we could go together.

48
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,872
I am the type who can't sleep on the train.

49
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:19,917
Wanna eat oranges?

50
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:21,038
Don't worry.

51
00:05:23,292 --> 00:05:26,210
It's tough to sit all night, isn't it?

52
00:05:27,617 --> 00:05:28,399
Have a Cigaret?

53
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,072
I know you don't want.

54
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,449
Arrive 9:30 to Tokyo.

55
00:05:45,501 --> 00:05:47,549
Shimbashi is just a little earlier.

56
00:05:55,151 --> 00:06:03,618
How long does it take to get from Tokyo Station to Ichigaya Mitsuke.

57
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:06,608
about 10 minutes by taxi

58
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:09,176
Oh, it's your first time in Tokyo?

59
00:06:10,012 --> 00:06:10,843
Yes.

60
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:13,425
Well, it's tough to be alone

61
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:16,159
If you'd like, I can accompany you

62
00:06:16,214 --> 00:06:17,414
It's not far from Tokyo Station.

63
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:19,130
Don't worry.

64
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,672
It won't take long for one taxi, and I think I can go by myself

65
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:22,695
I see.

66
00:06:26,272 --> 00:06:27,855
I'm worried about something, you know

67
00:06:29,482 --> 00:06:31,858
I got on from Osaka, right?

68
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,807
Actually, I felt that way from the moment I saw you.

69
00:06:39,314 --> 00:06:40,277
I'm sorry

70
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,366
It's because I like someone like you

71
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,043
I thought it would be a bit romantic
Please have a sandwich.

72
00:06:50,325 --> 00:06:50,968
Oh yeah.

73
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:53,256
I'm giving you my business card

74
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,063
If you happen to be in Ginza, please do stop by

75
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,344
I assure you,I am nothing suspicious.

76
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:04,311
please do stop by.

77
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:06,990
Thank you very much.

78
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,958
I've really started to like you.

79
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,740
Please have a  sandwich.

80
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:23,572
in from the countryside to Tokyo

81
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,540
People flowing in under various fates

82
00:07:29,675 --> 00:07:37,664
This person, Reiko Minagawa, also ran away from her mother-in-law in Okayama and is now in Tokyo.

83
00:07:39,777 --> 00:07:43,247
In a hurry, the local authorities

84
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:49,946
Feudal marriages are still common in rural areas.

85
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:52,252
Reiko also did it at home because of it.

86
00:08:04,356 --> 00:08:04,895
I'm home.

87
00:08:05,016 --> 00:08:05,943
Welcome back.

88
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:18,674
Yes, it's here.
Here's Sanyo dormitory.

89
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:21,886
Just a moment.
I think he's here.

90
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,510
Isomura-san, it's a phone call.

91
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:31,230
Is it for me?

92
00:08:31,466 --> 00:08:32,145
Yes, it is.

93
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,770
Hello? This is Isomura

94
00:08:45,722 --> 00:08:47,346
I'm Minagawa.

95
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:48,244
Minagawa?

96
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,107
This is Minagawa from Okayama.

97
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:52,178
from Okayama?

98
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:55,748
Are you Reiko?

99
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,395
Yes It's Reiko.

100
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:00,835
So, I came out to Tokyo.

101
00:09:01,747 --> 00:09:03,159
When did you come?

102
00:09:03,547 --> 00:09:04,522
Where are you now?

103
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,638
I'm in front of Iidabashi Station

104
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,574
I'm at the public phone in front of the station.

105
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:11,520
so come over here right away.

106
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,740
It doesn't take much time to get here from Iidabashi

107
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,430
Ah, but

108
00:09:18,763 --> 00:09:21,636
Your place has more guests from Okayama Prefecture?

109
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:23,289
Yes.

110
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,846
Yes, it seems that there are mostly students from Okayama Prefecture here

111
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,647
Um, if I happen to be seen by someone who knows me when I visit there...

112
00:09:35,045 --> 00:09:37,209
Hello?

113
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:38,949
Hello?

114
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:40,613
Isomura-san

115
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,244
I ran away from home.

116
00:09:48,075 --> 00:09:49,003
I understand.

117
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,582
I'll head over there right away.

118
00:09:51,264 --> 00:09:52,516
It's Iidabashi Station, right?

119
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,133
I'll wait at the station entrance.

120
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,620
As soon as you cross the bridge, there's the entrance to the station, right?

121
00:10:00,807 --> 00:10:02,134
Yes, I understand

122
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,560
Then I'll go right away, it should take about ten minutes

123
00:10:42,024 --> 00:10:43,236
Don't be rush.

124
00:10:43,657 --> 00:10:45,002
This is my shoe.

125
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,114
How long does it take from here?

126
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,779
it should take about ten minutes

127
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,560
even walking would take about ten minutes.

128
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:47,429
Oh, I'm really sorry.

129
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,031
I'm home.

130
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:21,322
Welcome back.

131
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:30,940
Yes it is.

132
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,883
Is Isomura there?

133
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:34,926
He just went out.

134
00:14:35,021 --> 00:14:36,203
When was it?

135
00:14:36,673 --> 00:14:38,922
It was about 1 hour ago

136
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:46,250
anyone came to visit me?

137
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:48,517
I just received a call again,

138
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:50,433
A woman?

139
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,339
Yes. Her voice was beautiful

140
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,288
She said she would come here?

141
00:14:54,923 --> 00:14:57,299
She just asked me if you went out.

142
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:08,107
Excuse me.

143
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:10,795
Is this really Iidabashi?

144
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,710
Iidabashi?

145
00:15:13,938 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes.

146
00:16:29,983 --> 00:16:32,983
Since then, no one has come to visit?

147
00:16:33,086 --> 00:16:35,782
No one has come to see us.

148
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,037
That's strange, no phone calls or anything?

149
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:39,874
No.

150
00:16:45,516 --> 00:16:47,752
He acts weird.

151
00:16:48,297 --> 00:16:50,027
He's always like that.

152
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:58,414
Yes, yes, that's right.

153
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,994
Ah, it's you from earlier.

154
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,923
Mr. Isomura just left right after coming home.

155
00:17:06,570 --> 00:17:08,940
Ah, wait, wait a moment please

156
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,650
It's a telegram from Kenjiro Okada

157
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,443
Oh from dormitory superintendent.

158
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,773
Hello? I don't know because Mr. Isomura has also gone out

159
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:38,485
Isomura has gone back and forth on this road between Iidabashi and the lodging countless times.

160
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:44,191
However, Isomura, who is somewhat laid-back and not yet accustomed to the city,

161
00:17:44,879 --> 00:17:48,067
He does not notice that there are two entrances to Iidabashi Station

162
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,047
Iidabashi Station has two entrances: one on the Iidabashi side

163
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,371
and the other closer to Ushigome.

164
00:18:22,345 --> 00:18:23,905
Hey Isomura?

165
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,333
What are you doing?

166
00:18:29,255 --> 00:18:30,848
I'm waiting for someone I promised to meet.

167
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,989
is it a woman? Well, I don't wanna disturb you.

168
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,720
but it's fine now.

169
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,772
No matter how long I wait, She won't come.

170
00:18:40,883 --> 00:18:42,311
At what time do you promise?

171
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,876
She called me at one point.

172
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,816
Well, hasn't it been five or six hours already?

173
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:50,271
She stood up you.

174
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:51,428
Yeah, let's go home

175
00:18:51,482 --> 00:18:53,548
but It wouldn't happen.

176
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,345
Did you make a promise to meet here?

177
00:19:00,297 --> 00:19:02,129
the entrance of Iidabashi Station

178
00:19:02,314 --> 00:19:04,647
Then did you go over there too?

179
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:08,628
over there?

180
00:19:08,895 --> 00:19:11,895
There's another entrance.

181
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,170
As I thought

182
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,551
Go there.

183
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:26,150
This way is faster.

184
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,657
Excuse me.

185
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,390
was there a young woman around here?

186
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,987
Yes She was.

187
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:55,985
She was a young and cute lady, right? It seemed like she had been waiting for quite a while

188
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:59,797
So, it was just about fifteen minutes ago.

189
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,600
It seemed like she took a taxi there.

190
00:21:24,554 --> 00:21:25,180
Hello?

191
00:21:25,218 --> 00:21:25,933
Yes, yes,

192
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:26,920
Okane?

193
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:27,667
that's right.

194
00:21:28,035 --> 00:21:29,708
She visited there?

195
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,239
No one has come even once

196
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,082
Not at all

197
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:38,002
If it's Isomura-kun, I'll take care of it.

198
00:21:38,468 --> 00:21:39,628
please wait a moment.

199
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:41,411
I'm switching with superintendent now

200
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,422
Hello? Hello? Hello?

201
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,135
He hang up the phone.

202
00:21:58,829 --> 00:22:01,829
It seems it was from Isomura-kun?

203
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,795
Unfortunately, The phone hangs up, but I think he will be back shortly.

204
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:13,209
Did the maid not hear the name of the woman
who called Isomura?

205
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:17,259
It seems that she didn't say her name.

206
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:18,925
That's why I sent a telegram

207
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,155
It's your fault, you know. It's proof that your supervision isn't thorough

208
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,240
I’m sorry.

209
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,406
I rushed here from Okayama like this,

210
00:22:27,611 --> 00:22:29,042
it doesn't mean anything at all.

211
00:22:29,673 --> 00:22:30,853
Who's he?

212
00:22:31,077 --> 00:22:31,997
That person is scary, right?

213
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,787
In Okayama Prefecture, He's the richest

214
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,792
He built this dormitory for us

215
00:22:38,851 --> 00:22:40,452
That's great.

216
00:22:40,543 --> 00:22:41,776
Shut up.

217
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,192
That call is definitely from Reiko

218
00:22:46,227 --> 00:22:49,287
especially since Isomura hasn't come back, she must be Reiko Minagawa.

219
00:22:50,846 --> 00:22:53,340
He's just gang, not student.

220
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,414
Reiko is my fiancée

221
00:22:56,653 --> 00:23:00,440
He seduced her even though he was a student.

222
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,487
I know everything.

223
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
I also know that Reiko turned down my marriage proposal and ran away from home

224
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,045
Everyone is just because of Isomura.

225
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:13,113
I beg your pardon, but...

226
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,325
The student Akira Isomura, based on his usual behavior,

227
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,104
He's very good man.

228
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:22,550
You don't have eyes for people.

229
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,155
I even know that Isomura is exchanging letters with Reiko

230
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:35,352
However, the student Isomura, who is from Okayama, is...

231
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:43,428
He is indebted to you for your assistance.

232
00:23:43,501 --> 00:23:45,201
That's why he's bad.

233
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:52,288
He can live in Tokyo without lodging because of me.

234
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,478
But well, it can't be helped

235
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,492
It's unacceptable for a student to stay here.

236
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:04,667
Get him out from here.

237
00:24:31,343 --> 00:24:33,029
Yes it is.

238
00:24:34,284 --> 00:24:36,395
Is Isomura back?

239
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:39,420
Oh, Isomura? Please wait a moment

240
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:40,669
Is Isomura here?

241
00:24:41,132 --> 00:24:44,132
She got a call from a woman, and he went out

242
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:48,594
Um, hello? he went out with a woman

243
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:50,756
he still hasn't come back

244
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,146
I truly feel sorry for you.

245
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:55,419
I see, thank you very much.

246
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,386
Even a trivial mistake can often determine a person's fate

247
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,644
Some seek death for that reason

248
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,256
However, some unexpectedly find themselves on a different shore because of it

249
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:59,342
And again, they take a new step into life with a hand grenade

250
00:26:35,743 --> 00:26:37,683
Good morning.

251
00:27:06,689 --> 00:27:09,115
Don't you think that's a bit strange?

252
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:09,963
What is?

253
00:27:10,316 --> 00:27:12,351
Since Minagawa became the president's secretary

254
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,630
the president come to company early.

255
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,558
Our president is serious man.

256
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,495
Is that so?

257
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,843
Well then, could you call Mr. Kudo

258
00:27:44,943 --> 00:27:47,137
Who are you?

259
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,120
I am Akemi, the president's younger sister.

260
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,020
I apologize for that.

261
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,346
it's fine.

262
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,777
Quickly call Mr. Kudo.

263
00:27:58,031 --> 00:27:59,171
The chief,right?

264
00:27:59,196 --> 00:27:59,808
Yes.

265
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:10,296
Oh dear, I'm sorry.

266
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,355
I have a small favor to ask of you.

267
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,505
It is forbidden by the president to give you your allowance.

268
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,960
so it's a bit rude, right?
I don't mean that.

269
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:29,206
I would like to have one person hired as an employee, you know

270
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:30,648
employee?

271
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,396
He's still a student,

272
00:28:33,426 --> 00:28:36,426
He has to work to support myself

273
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,745
I met him at a pachinko parlor

274
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,900
he's a student working part-time at a pachinko parlor

275
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:44,362
It's a problem that  he's still student.

276
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,756
But what does the president say?

277
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:50,349
Don't ask him.
He's a useless president doesn't pay any attention to someone like me

278
00:28:51,056 --> 00:28:54,703
Oh, by the way, I was just informed by his wife

279
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:58,320
Why don't you hire him as your housekeeper?

280
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,016
As expected, thank you.

281
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:17,783
Resume is fine.
That’s fine, and the guarantor is Madam, ok?

282
00:29:29,283 --> 00:29:32,283
Is it really true that they say it’s over just like that?

283
00:29:33,154 --> 00:29:34,560
Thank you

284
00:29:36,417 --> 00:29:38,144
Take care of this.

285
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:41,389
Please repair it.

286
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:46,438
Help me to tie this.

287
00:29:49,451 --> 00:29:50,931
This is too flashy.

288
00:29:52,823 --> 00:29:54,203
Welcome back.

289
00:29:56,548 --> 00:29:57,335
Welcome back.

290
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,104
You back home early.

291
00:30:01,027 --> 00:30:03,657
Have you gotten used to the company little?

292
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:05,705
The president is a really nice person.

293
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,356
By the way, I can't see Kudo-san lately.

294
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,046
Oh, He just got here the day before yesterday

295
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:14,076
He was really drunk

296
00:30:14,682 --> 00:30:16,131
Company will pay the bill.

297
00:30:16,552 --> 00:30:18,157
Please don't lend money too much about the others

298
00:30:18,703 --> 00:30:19,460
Thank you.

299
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:26,558
Rei, you're still thinking about it, huh?

300
00:30:27,421 --> 00:30:28,033
Don't worry.

301
00:30:28,378 --> 00:30:30,219
You can't keep worrying forever

302
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,795
If you're feeling regret, just forget it

303
00:30:32,074 --> 00:30:32,990
I'll do it.

304
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:37,679
But honestly, I think about what would have happened if I hadn't met you back then

305
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,199
Really.

306
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,342
It was good I could give you my business card, He's still a student, right?

307
00:30:44,867 --> 00:30:48,294
I don't know what students are thinking these days.

308
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:52,004
Listen, I'm telling you all this too

309
00:30:52,286 --> 00:30:55,768
Don't trust any man too much.

310
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,800
Men often say things without thinking

311
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,714
All men are play boy.

312
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,317
Men hit on women all the time.

313
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:09,466
but it doesn't always work out that way

314
00:31:09,607 --> 00:31:11,352
In the end, it's a source of suffering

315
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:15,532
Well, after all, We are women, we are lonely.

316
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,298
It's time for some love philosophy

317
00:31:21,825 --> 00:31:23,418
Welcome.

318
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:24,770
It's been ages.

319
00:31:25,061 --> 00:31:27,057
Oh, there’s been a business issue in Kobe for a while

320
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:31,410
Just wait a moment, I will tidy up the room on the second floor right away.

321
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:44,670
You can come up if you want

322
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,457
Who is the girl down there?

323
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,450
I don't know.

324
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:20,708
Good morning

325
00:32:21,036 --> 00:32:22,364
Good morning

326
00:32:24,161 --> 00:32:25,426
Good morning

327
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:29,083
Was that OK?

328
00:32:29,309 --> 00:32:30,746
We managed it.

329
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:32,059
That's good.

330
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:32,997
Excuse me.

331
00:33:00,418 --> 00:33:01,028
Hello?

332
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:02,504
Is my bros there?

333
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,379
From your house.

334
00:33:07,167 --> 00:33:09,785
yes, yes, it's me

335
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,512
Brother? Isomura-san is starting to work today.

336
00:33:14,106 --> 00:33:17,254
How long will it be just walking the dog?

337
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:20,806
I don't know about that either. Ask Ritsuko.

338
00:33:21,598 --> 00:33:24,418
My sister is not here

339
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:28,310
Can I decide? I will decide, so

340
00:33:29,324 --> 00:33:31,820
please teach me French too

341
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,716
I'm not very confident,

342
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,809
I'll give you more rewards.

343
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,480
Your mother wants to know his background.

344
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:46,540
He's Akira Isomura, not from Hiroshima but from Okayama.

345
00:33:47,114 --> 00:33:49,965
His family is poor, but he's talented.

346
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:53,730
He's in trouble after being kicked out of his university dorm.

347
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:56,512
The reason He was kicked out is....

348
00:33:56,606 --> 00:33:59,411
That is suspicious.

349
00:33:59,614 --> 00:34:00,856
Hey.

350
00:34:19,712 --> 00:34:22,712
Reiko has finally gotten used to life in the building

351
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:29,307
and has discovered a way to heal the terrible shock she experienced by working through it,

352
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,254
and these days she is already part of the president's desk

353
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,585
She even felt like trying to decorate a magazine with flowers

354
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:42,424
She take the leftover flowers from Madame's shop every morning

355
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,855
and replace them daily

356
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,730
And then..

357
00:34:56,895 --> 00:34:57,903
Good morning.

358
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,036
Good morning.

359
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,426
Good morning.

360
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:45,489
Good morning.

361
00:35:48,364 --> 00:35:49,497
Good morning.

362
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,126
It seems like you have quite active.

363
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:07,520
Minagawa.

364
00:36:10,606 --> 00:36:12,387
What time is the meeting with Shimamura-san?

365
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,684
It is scheduled for eight o'clock.

366
00:36:14,709 --> 00:36:15,770
Thanks.

367
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:28,511
Um, what is this that you've given me?

368
00:36:28,856 --> 00:36:29,426
Why?

369
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,855
I offered it as a thank you for the flowers

370
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:38,450
It's you who brings flowers every morning

371
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,637
The flowers are for use at home.

372
00:36:43,379 --> 00:36:44,567
and this perfume is the same.

373
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,020
I was asked by my wife, so I bought two.

374
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,535
But something like this...

375
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,918
even this flower is quite nice

376
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,965
Flowers and perfume are different.

377
00:36:55,301 --> 00:36:56,364
They are the same.

378
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:59,830
Perfume is something I made with flower.

379
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:03,934
Please take it.

380
00:37:04,668 --> 00:37:06,887
Thank you very much.

381
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:16,629
It smells good.

382
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:19,887
Let me smell it.

383
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,543
It smells good.

384
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,426
This is awesome.

385
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:33,076
It must cost around 20000.

386
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:36,100
Don't talk about the prices.

387
00:37:38,723 --> 00:37:39,864
It smells good.

388
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,168
this is something the president gave me.

389
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:45,051
This is a French perfume.

390
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,605
This is a very luxurious perfume

391
00:37:49,286 --> 00:37:51,144
You really should accept something like that?

392
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,145
He is into you.

393
00:37:53,182 --> 00:37:55,122
Oh, the president isn't like that at all

394
00:37:55,279 --> 00:37:59,185
That's fine, but there are two types of ways men approach things

395
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,496
One is to take a forceful approach.

396
00:38:01,933 --> 00:38:05,059
and the other is to pretend to be serious at first and then reveal one's true self

397
00:38:05,434 --> 00:38:07,223
Which one is me?

398
00:38:07,961 --> 00:38:10,960
You seem to do both

399
00:38:14,868 --> 00:38:20,660
She gradually understand that a job that adds some excitement to life is important

400
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,480
Commuting to work every day becomes enjoyable

401
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,551
Good morning.

402
00:38:32,347 --> 00:38:34,230
Hey, don't you think it's strange?

403
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:35,074
What is?

404
00:38:35,473 --> 00:38:37,645
Isn't the president coming back later these days?

405
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,035
That's true

406
00:38:41,145 --> 00:38:43,655
don't you think it's strange?

407
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,680
The president seems to be in a really good mood lately

408
00:38:49,184 --> 00:38:50,731
He must be in love with someone.

409
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,792
People are not what they seem

410
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,895
Maybe I should just quit

411
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:14,652
it seems that the president's wife has some business with you

412
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:41,191
You are the president's secretary, aren't you?

413
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:42,278
Yes

414
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:45,788
Thank you for taking care of my husband.

415
00:39:51,221 --> 00:39:55,934
Do you bring these beautiful flowers every day?

416
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:59,458
That job is hard

417
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:05,316
What do you mean by giving him flowers?

418
00:40:07,801 --> 00:40:09,051
Please be clear about it

419
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:15,699
We haven't misunderstood each other over trivial matters

420
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:19,137
There is no particular meaning to that.

421
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:24,488
You're kind.
Did my husband give you anything in return?

422
00:40:27,246 --> 00:40:29,504
I received some perfume from him some time ago.

423
00:40:29,614 --> 00:40:30,114
Then?

424
00:40:30,613 --> 00:40:36,777
And then, I received this brooch

425
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:44,199
It really suits you, doesn't it? That clothes too?

426
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,793
Well, this was made by my older sister.

427
00:40:50,395 --> 00:40:51,418
I understand.

428
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,720
It seems like I've gotten into a bit of trouble.

429
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:34,129
This is a diamond brooch

430
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:41,480
Anyway, This is an order from my wife.

431
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,082
I'm saying that I want you to quit immediately

432
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,770
Moreover, if I talk to the president, he might try to stop you

433
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:51,260
I'm saying that we should make it look like you are resigning voluntarily

434
00:41:52,141 --> 00:41:59,644
This is like a traffic accident.

435
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:03,434
Please accept it.

436
00:42:04,166 --> 00:42:07,645
I have done nothing wrong.

437
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:22,559
Thank you very much.

438
00:42:24,883 --> 00:42:26,074
Osaka is fine.

439
00:42:34,242 --> 00:42:35,613
Oh, thank you very much

440
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:48,199
Um, I have a bit of a situation, and I would like to resign

441
00:42:48,504 --> 00:42:51,668
Would you quit your job?

442
00:42:55,035 --> 00:42:55,988
Why?

443
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:00,329
I'm going to quit because I have a bit of a situation

444
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,960
If there is something going on, I can't just stop

445
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:10,070
And I can't just intrude and ask again

446
00:43:12,012 --> 00:43:14,543
Are you dissatisfied with the treatment you receive at your company?

447
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:15,356
No.

448
00:43:17,235 --> 00:43:19,395
It's not like that.

449
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,387
if that's the case, then there's nothing I can do

450
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:27,582
However, I wanted you to stay with me all along

451
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:31,551
When will you leave the company?

452
00:43:32,125 --> 00:43:35,125
It's better to do it sooner rather than later

453
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:40,074
Well, starting tomorrow, I won't be able to accept this flower

454
00:43:43,442 --> 00:43:46,442
Thank you very much for everything.

455
00:43:48,067 --> 00:43:48,879
Reiko.

456
00:43:50,176 --> 00:43:53,473
Let's shake hands once as a farewell.

457
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:12,370
Reiko, I liked you

458
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,457
I wish you happiness.

459
00:45:22,934 --> 00:45:23,590
Reiko.

460
00:45:24,075 --> 00:45:26,567
I didn't notice you.

461
00:45:26,991 --> 00:45:28,500
How do you like your job?

462
00:45:28,885 --> 00:45:30,532
Thank you for everything

463
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:33,492
Thanks to you, I found job soon.

464
00:45:33,577 --> 00:45:35,083
Did you like it?

465
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:38,422
I'm still not used to it.

466
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:40,917
I asked the manager about you.

467
00:45:41,786 --> 00:45:43,852
You wanna meet him?

468
00:45:44,449 --> 00:45:45,649
He's too great for me.

469
00:45:45,674 --> 00:45:49,266
He is my funny friend from the club and a laid-back guy

470
00:45:49,905 --> 00:45:51,271
Yes, let's go with that after all

471
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,676
For now, let's have a meal together

472
00:45:53,706 --> 00:45:56,706
It's better to become acquainted directly for future advantages

473
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:57,705
But.

474
00:45:57,819 --> 00:45:58,585
it's okay

475
00:45:58,616 --> 00:46:02,537
I'll go with you. What time are we meeting?

476
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:05,415
I can leave by six-thirty

477
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:09,490
Then I'll go around back and bring the car at that time

478
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,323
Thank you so much for everything.

479
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,304
Let me see this.

480
00:46:12,329 --> 00:46:13,097
Welcome.

481
00:46:14,543 --> 00:46:15,523
This?

482
00:46:23,596 --> 00:46:24,864
Isomura-san, over here.

483
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:27,526
Aren't you going to buy a dictionary?

484
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:30,616
Let's not put that off.
we should go buy a good one quickly.

485
00:46:30,833 --> 00:46:32,213
Let's go.

486
00:46:34,028 --> 00:46:35,588
Let's see them.

487
00:46:36,604 --> 00:46:38,199
How about watching Bra?

488
00:46:38,301 --> 00:46:39,176
Yeah, okay

489
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,840
Welcome.

490
00:46:48,676 --> 00:46:50,340
Look at this.

491
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:57,830
Well, what do you think about that?

492
00:46:59,145 --> 00:47:00,731
Does this suit me?

493
00:47:02,176 --> 00:47:04,027
I wonder if it's good.

494
00:47:04,052 --> 00:47:05,528
Oh.

495
00:47:08,372 --> 00:47:10,355
Are you Minagawa?

496
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,692
I've met you before, you know

497
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,238
I'm sorry I didn't notice you.

498
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:17,614
Do you work here now?

499
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,668
I know a little bit about it

500
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,200
I'm sorry, but that's just how that wife is

501
00:47:23,999 --> 00:47:26,465
She is a very old-fashioned person

502
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:29,490
She is very jealous.

503
00:47:30,117 --> 00:47:32,363
Their marriage is not going well.

504
00:47:32,586 --> 00:47:33,356
Is it my fault?

505
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:33,958
No.

506
00:47:34,452 --> 00:47:36,801
I think that's the wife's fault.

507
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:40,770
So when the president found out, he was very angry.

508
00:47:42,723 --> 00:47:46,668
Their relationship is very bad now.

509
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:50,669
I'll come back later.

510
00:47:55,261 --> 00:47:58,261
but you like him,right?

511
00:49:22,137 --> 00:49:24,044
She's here.

512
00:49:26,207 --> 00:49:29,230
Oh, please come in.

513
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:30,997
sorry for being late

514
00:49:31,062 --> 00:49:34,062
No, no, no, The manager hasn't come yet.

515
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:35,606
Please have this first

516
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:47,028
Is the usual food okay?

517
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,997
Yes please.

518
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:12,084
It's nice to come to such a calm place once in a while.

519
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:15,647
What are your hobbies?

520
00:50:17,942 --> 00:50:21,466
Has the manager arrived yet?

521
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,396
it's late, isn't it?

522
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,475
The shopkeeper turned off the lights.

523
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:32,677
They care about our moods.

524
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,975
I have to go.

525
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:39,904
There is a light switch there

526
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,375
Where is the switch? I can't find it.

527
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,334
but that's strange

528
00:50:49,892 --> 00:50:51,318
Isn't it around here?

529
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:57,756
It should be here

530
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,215
Reiko.

531
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:11,264
Don't do that.

532
00:51:59,994 --> 00:52:03,276
Eventually, Reiko came home completely exhausted.

533
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:09,072
Fortunately, everyone is asleep

534
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:16,306
She stood in the late-night streets waiting for everyone to fall asleep before heading home

535
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:20,480
She didn't want anyone to see her like this

536
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,845
What if Madame sees her?

537
00:52:53,346 --> 00:52:53,963
Reiko?

538
00:52:59,111 --> 00:53:00,393
I'm home.

539
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:03,572
You're late

540
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,796
You can't sleep in a place like that

541
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:08,820
Come quickly, please come quickly.

542
00:53:14,082 --> 00:53:16,495
No matter how you cry, I won't understand

543
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:20,270
Hurry up and tell me, who made you go through that?

544
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:22,512
I know I'm foolish,

545
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,136
so I understand that you are the fool.

546
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,113
You were taken to such a place

547
00:53:28,535 --> 00:53:31,613
Is he Shinohara?

548
00:53:33,125 --> 00:53:34,379
Sister.

549
00:53:44,895 --> 00:53:46,223
I knew it would be like this.

550
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:52,840
So what happened to you? Did you lose?

551
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:58,254
Listen, I didn't sleep with him.

552
00:54:06,965 --> 00:54:08,497
Stop it....

553
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:46,965
Her fingers are gradually losing strength

554
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:56,317
Her knees are shaking and trembling, she think it's really over, she see the window.

555
00:54:59,722 --> 00:55:05,400
I had jumped out of that round window and rolled onto the roof.

556
00:55:07,073 --> 00:55:08,604
It was impressive.

557
00:55:09,614 --> 00:55:13,182
I'm glad, I'm glad! Thank you.

558
00:55:15,893 --> 00:55:17,440
It was my fault.

559
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:20,510
Knowing someone named Shinohara,

560
00:55:20,874 --> 00:55:23,874
I'm sorry I ask you to work there.

561
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,439
After all, this wasn't a place for you

562
00:55:41,430 --> 00:55:43,182
Thank you for waiting

563
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:49,814
I am looking for a handkerchief.

564
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:51,416
What kind?

565
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,370
I'm looking for a handkerchief with a beautiful design.

566
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,002
how about this?

567
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,541
Oh

568
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:00,016
I heard from my sister that you were here

569
00:56:01,049 --> 00:56:01,760
It's been ages.

570
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:05,299
Kudo told me why you quit your job.

571
00:56:06,546 --> 00:56:08,471
I apologize for the inconvenience

572
00:56:09,955 --> 00:56:11,736
Is this a handkerchief with a Japanese design?

573
00:56:12,309 --> 00:56:13,517
Yes.

574
00:56:13,948 --> 00:56:15,151
I'll take this.

575
00:56:18,171 --> 00:56:21,791
I hope to see you again somewhere soon

576
00:56:24,150 --> 00:56:26,955
Huh? Then please prepare this.

577
00:56:27,365 --> 00:56:28,736
Well then, I'll take two thousand yen.

578
00:56:57,948 --> 00:56:59,573
I'm sorry for being late.

579
00:56:59,598 --> 00:57:03,174
Ah, welcome back! It was such a nice room

580
00:57:03,210 --> 00:57:04,650
I completely liked it.

581
00:57:04,932 --> 00:57:05,940
Madam is here too.

582
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:08,150
Oh really?

583
00:57:13,518 --> 00:57:14,682
I'm sorry for being late.

584
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:17,830
Welcome back, How was it? It's a nice room, isn't it?

585
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:19,870
Thank you for cleaning up too.

586
00:57:20,448 --> 00:57:22,041
oh, could you please hand me that?

587
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,936
You're safe here now

588
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,960
Also, just to be cautious, I rent here down under my name

589
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,590
Oh, by the way put this up.

590
00:57:49,612 --> 00:57:50,541
will you put that up?

591
00:57:52,250 --> 00:57:53,432
I'll help it.

592
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:57,072
Are you Watanabe-san?

593
00:57:57,721 --> 00:57:59,755
 I just moved in today

594
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:00,956
Nice to meet you.

595
00:58:00,988 --> 00:58:02,986
I'm Onodera Daisaku is in that room

596
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:04,103
Should I help you?

597
00:58:04,151 --> 00:58:05,596
Don't worry.

598
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:10,510
I plan to move into another apartment.

599
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:15,681
Who is he?

600
00:58:15,807 --> 00:58:17,385
He said, "The student across the street."

601
00:58:18,004 --> 00:58:20,736
You have to be careful; students these days are...

602
00:58:21,112 --> 00:58:22,127
Be careful.

603
00:58:24,150 --> 00:58:26,353
Ah, that's Ok.

604
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,463
Welcome.

605
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:52,330
Do you have any handkerchiefs for gifts?

606
00:58:52,854 --> 00:58:54,463
How about this?

607
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,502
If it's okay with you,

608
00:58:56,527 --> 00:58:58,026
I'm embarrassed.

609
00:58:58,666 --> 00:59:01,729
Do you have no work tomorrow?

610
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:05,635
would you like to join me for dinner tomorrow

611
00:59:05,736 --> 00:59:10,630
I just made plans to meet with this friend a little while ago

612
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:13,369
That's too bad.

613
00:59:13,837 --> 00:59:18,173
Well then, please let me know about the next time.
One dozen please

614
01:00:31,751 --> 01:00:34,751
Yeah, Look at them.

615
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,857
Isomura....

616
01:02:40,749 --> 01:02:41,602
bonsoir mademoiselle

617
01:02:42,006 --> 01:02:43,300
bonsoir mademoiselle

618
01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:45,841
bonsoir mademoiselle

619
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:47,938
bonsoir mademoiselle

620
01:02:49,168 --> 01:02:51,050
Why do you keep looking at my face?

621
01:02:52,538 --> 01:02:54,945
bonsoir mademoiselle

622
01:02:55,691 --> 01:02:57,999
It feels strange to me.

623
01:02:59,643 --> 01:03:01,170
Why are you fidgeting?

624
01:03:01,764 --> 01:03:03,931
It's because you lack composure

625
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:06,065
Well then, let's leave it at this for today.

626
01:03:06,494 --> 01:03:08,761
I wanna stay with you more.

627
01:03:10,357 --> 01:03:13,357
but I do have some appointment today

628
01:03:13,969 --> 01:03:17,572
Oh, you're so mean.

629
01:05:21,081 --> 01:05:22,001
Have you made it?

630
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:25,373
Let's drink.

631
01:05:31,323 --> 01:05:32,476
Come in.

632
01:05:36,843 --> 01:05:40,138
Oh you, join us.

633
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,706
I'm busy.

634
01:05:44,009 --> 01:05:46,298
Ah, thank you for this!

635
01:05:47,267 --> 01:05:49,473
Hey, don't rush, sit down.

636
01:05:50,508 --> 01:05:51,255
Isomura.

637
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:54,474
I was just talking about it.
There are plenty of women in the world.

638
01:05:55,340 --> 01:05:58,340
You don't have to wait outside on a cold day for a woman

639
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,454
How many days now?

640
01:06:01,350 --> 01:06:02,573
It's already the third day

641
01:06:03,270 --> 01:06:04,777
Do you think she will show up?

642
01:06:04,978 --> 01:06:06,291
You should give up?

643
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:12,053
A beautiful woman moved into the room across the room.

644
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,316
If you take a peek, you might change your mind

645
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,793
I have to go.

646
01:06:18,757 --> 01:06:20,885
Well, you're a pitiful guy.

647
01:06:20,910 --> 01:06:22,823
Are you standing around at the station again tonight?

648
01:06:26,511 --> 01:06:27,377
Isomura?

649
01:06:32,218 --> 01:06:34,344
I don't think she's coming tonight either.

650
01:08:39,398 --> 01:08:40,345
Welcome.

651
01:08:42,212 --> 01:08:43,845
Could I have a handkerchief?

652
01:08:45,402 --> 01:08:47,089
How about that?

653
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,720
It's been turned into a pharmaceutical product, though

654
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:54,183
So, I'll have this one dozen, is there anything else?

655
01:08:55,610 --> 01:08:58,610
Well, He often buy handkerchiefs

656
01:09:05,332 --> 01:09:06,698
How about this?

657
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:08,889
They are curious about us

658
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:12,142
Then I will try not to come as much as possible

659
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:16,220
At least,we can have a dinner tonight's Christmas.

660
01:09:16,477 --> 01:09:18,243
I would be happy to join you, if that's alright with you.

661
01:09:23,948 --> 01:09:26,368
Please come here.

662
01:09:29,852 --> 01:09:30,825
I'll buy this.

663
01:09:31,862 --> 01:09:33,351
Thank you very much.

664
01:10:24,514 --> 01:10:25,420
Is this Yurakubashi?

665
01:10:25,445 --> 01:10:26,476
Yes.

666
01:10:26,983 --> 01:10:29,085
I'll get off here.

667
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:18,075
I'll be waiting at Yurakubashi forever.

668
01:11:19,433 --> 01:11:20,219
forever.

669
01:11:31,678 --> 01:11:32,318
Hey.

670
01:11:35,022 --> 01:11:38,068
There's really no need to panic

671
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:40,366
Well, anyway, I have to go and see

672
01:11:41,803 --> 01:11:43,092
Are you standing there again?

673
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,218
Please go and eat some soba noodles.

674
01:11:45,752 --> 01:11:47,725
The rest I leave to you

675
01:11:52,863 --> 01:11:54,443
He is a very unusual young man.

676
01:13:00,054 --> 01:13:01,227
To Teikoku Hotel.

677
01:13:30,442 --> 01:13:32,762
Sorry for making you wait.

678
01:13:35,216 --> 01:13:38,216
I thought you might not be here.

679
01:13:38,690 --> 01:13:40,237
I'm here.

680
01:13:42,181 --> 01:13:44,175
I'm glad to come here.

681
01:14:32,830 --> 01:14:37,466
Reiko, we shook hands when you left the company, didn't we?

682
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:41,566
But now that we can meet again

683
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,877
what I said back then...

684
01:14:44,010 --> 01:14:45,032
Do you still remember?

685
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:53,905
I like you, and I still love you even now

686
01:14:55,966 --> 01:14:57,513
I love you.

687
01:15:04,555 --> 01:15:08,263
Since then, my wife and I haven't been getting along well

688
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:10,867
No, I'm not saying it's your fault.

689
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:16,672
It's due to fundamental reasons, but we are currently living apart

690
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,305
And my wife finally demanded a divorce

691
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,945
Eventually, you'll go through that process.

692
01:15:35,351 --> 01:15:39,367
But I feel so liberated.

693
01:15:42,375 --> 01:15:43,625
Is that bad?

694
01:15:46,657 --> 01:15:49,164
I like you.

695
01:15:53,938 --> 01:15:55,219
Sorry.

696
01:15:58,729 --> 01:16:00,062
I met someone.

697
01:16:00,258 --> 01:16:00,907
Who?

698
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:07,332
I met a man who shocked me.

699
01:16:08,516 --> 01:16:09,875
Is that true?

700
01:16:10,516 --> 01:16:11,250
Yes.

701
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:13,211
I am heartbroken.

702
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:01,960
Isomura, why are you just reading books?

703
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:05,172
Are you scared of me?

704
01:18:06,701 --> 01:18:09,701
None of your friends have been considerate of us.

705
01:18:10,509 --> 01:18:12,187
I'm not scared at all.

706
01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:15,900
Then are you okay being here alone with me?

707
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:25,690
Well, I am a little cautious too

708
01:18:26,180 --> 01:18:28,121
Because you are man.

709
01:18:29,394 --> 01:18:30,264
There's no need for that

710
01:18:30,947 --> 01:18:32,625
I'm a gentleman.

711
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:40,430
so I guess I can relax and go to sleep now.

712
01:20:13,203 --> 01:20:14,323
What's wrong? Akemi.

713
01:20:15,307 --> 01:20:17,164
is there something wrong?

714
01:20:17,453 --> 01:20:18,844
Please tell me.

715
01:20:19,641 --> 01:20:22,688
I hate it.

716
01:20:22,852 --> 01:20:23,719
Let me go.

717
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:34,326
Well then, Please take care of it quickly.

718
01:20:34,350 --> 01:20:36,426
So let's make sure to get.

719
01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:39,450
It's a big deal, I have a problem.

720
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:41,148
Please leave,Kudo.

721
01:20:41,787 --> 01:20:43,020
When did you come back?

722
01:20:43,379 --> 01:20:45,579
I've just arrived.

723
01:20:47,242 --> 01:20:49,605
I want to get married

724
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:50,906
Who are you going to marry?

725
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:51,913
With Isomura.

726
01:20:52,293 --> 01:20:53,466
Hey, you say that so easily

727
01:20:54,290 --> 01:20:57,290
However, if it's with him, I agree

728
01:20:57,546 --> 01:20:58,617
But He's still a student

729
01:20:58,842 --> 01:21:00,368
I can't wait for his graduation

730
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,120
My enemy has appeared.

731
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:03,208
Your enemy has appeared?

732
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:07,842
In other words, it's Isomura's girlfriend. He had a girlfriend

733
01:21:08,110 --> 01:21:11,110
At least his ex-girlfriend.

734
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:16,035
but it's something that concerns you too, brother

735
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:20,840
Isomura's girlfriend is the Reiko Minagawa who was here

736
01:21:22,809 --> 01:21:23,894
You were surprised, weren't you?

737
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,812
So you can't just stay calm

738
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:29,930
You like Minagawa-san, right?

739
01:21:31,693 --> 01:21:33,539
Then Let's do this.

740
01:21:33,790 --> 01:21:36,416
In other words, if I marry Tamura-san,

741
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,440
then you'll be with Minagwa.

742
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:45,800
By the way, both of them are from Okayama.

743
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:47,906
I'm sure it's something like that evidence

744
01:21:48,189 --> 01:21:51,189
Until then, there were many times I thought it was strange.

745
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:55,620
Why are you spacing out?

746
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:07,394
Did you call for me?

747
01:22:09,098 --> 01:22:11,445
Have a seat.

748
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:16,954
I wanna talk to you about something

749
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:26,230
I know this is sudden and a bit reckless, but...

750
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:32,847
Actually, it's about my sister. Akemi has said that she wants to marry you

751
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:37,240
I had also heard about that from her.

752
01:22:37,980 --> 01:22:40,980
So, I wanted to hear your thoughts on it as well

753
01:22:42,650 --> 01:22:44,361
I think it's something to be grateful for

754
01:22:45,101 --> 01:22:46,121
Do you like her?

755
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,108
I don't dislike her

756
01:22:50,150 --> 01:22:53,150
However, do you have someone else you like?

757
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:58,545
I want you to tell me the truth.

758
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:04,400
But that's something that has happened from the past.

759
01:23:08,679 --> 01:23:11,679
Is that person named Minagawa Reiko?

760
01:23:13,142 --> 01:23:14,655
Huh? How do you know that?

761
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:18,062
To put it frankly,

762
01:23:18,366 --> 01:23:21,366
Minagawa worked for my company as a secretary.

763
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:28,328
Isomura.

764
01:23:41,113 --> 01:23:41,853
To put it frankly,

765
01:23:43,130 --> 01:23:46,327
I also love Reiko-san.

766
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,376
To be more honest,

767
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,400
I even think that I want to marry Reiko in the future

768
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,313
 but of course,

769
01:23:59,230 --> 01:24:02,230
that's just my own thought

770
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:10,675
By the way, actually today I heard from my sister about you and Reiko

771
01:24:11,870 --> 01:24:14,870
Rather than being unexpected, I was more surprised

772
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:19,710
Then my sister said that she wants to marry you

773
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,392
I think there are some subtle issues around that,

774
01:24:25,795 --> 01:24:28,795
and I’ve laid everything out for you.

775
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:31,530
I'm fine with my situation now.

776
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:36,970
What does that mean?

777
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:40,880
I don't feel anything for Reiko anymore

778
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:45,872
More importantly, we never made a promise to get married from the beginning

779
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:53,020
We just got to know each other during my time in Okayama and had a little emotional connection

780
01:24:56,256 --> 01:24:58,528
So, it was just that we were two beautiful first loves

781
01:24:59,416 --> 01:25:04,998
No, rather, I should have said that I was the one who made Reiko unhappy

782
01:25:09,540 --> 01:25:18,047
Shortly after I moved to Tokyo, Reiko-san also came to Tokyo, relying on me due to her dark family circumstances

783
01:25:20,476 --> 01:25:24,812
At that time, we made a promise in front of the Iidabashi station

784
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:30,519
Being careless, I didn't notice that there were two entrances to Iidabashi station

785
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,938
We couldn't meet up.

786
01:25:36,306 --> 01:25:43,733
I can imagine how much Reiko-san, who had just
come to Tokyo for the first time, struggled.

787
01:25:47,507 --> 01:25:50,507
Since then, it seems she hold a grudge with me.

788
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,713
I think it's only natural

789
01:25:56,426 --> 01:25:59,082
Since then, you guys haven't seen each other at all?

790
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:01,089
Right.

791
01:26:03,029 --> 01:26:07,047
However, once we meet again, there will be no way to regain the affection we had that crumbled

792
01:26:09,550 --> 01:26:12,550
Originally, I didn't have the power to make her happy.

793
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:17,166
How can someone who doesn't even have the power to make others happy have the right to love?

794
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,860
But I finally feel like I've lifted a burden off my shoulders.

795
01:26:25,648 --> 01:26:26,288
Please.

796
01:26:27,206 --> 01:26:30,569
Could you please marry her and make her happy?

797
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:40,242
Thank you, Nishimura-kun

798
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,536
Thank you for waiting

799
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:48,810
Thank you very much

800
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:50,170
Welcome.

801
01:26:54,182 --> 01:26:55,090
This?

802
01:26:56,310 --> 01:26:57,150
Well...

803
01:26:57,255 --> 01:26:58,858
There's a call for you.

804
01:26:59,188 --> 01:27:00,435
Leave it to you.

805
01:27:00,976 --> 01:27:02,256
Welcome.

806
01:27:03,609 --> 01:27:06,495
Hello? This is Nakata

807
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,306
I have something to discuss

808
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:13,491
Could you please come at the entrance of Iidabashi Station at 8 AM tomorrow?

809
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,974
that's the entrance of Iidabashi Station?

810
01:27:18,698 --> 01:27:21,285
Yes,that's it.

811
01:27:22,610 --> 01:27:24,434
I have a good story for you.

812
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:28,933
I understand, tomorrow at eight in the morning

813
01:27:29,663 --> 01:27:30,636
Iidabashi

814
01:28:14,403 --> 01:28:16,295
Just as I thought, you were at this exit.

815
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:18,447
I was waiting at the entrance on the other side for a while

816
01:28:19,196 --> 01:28:20,256
other side?

817
01:28:20,757 --> 01:28:23,257
There are two entrances to this station on the other side

818
01:28:23,410 --> 01:28:25,014
the entrance on this side

819
01:28:25,039 --> 01:28:27,602
and the other one at Ushigome exit.

820
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:39,454
Don't worry.

821
01:28:40,530 --> 01:28:43,178
The person waiting for you is at the entrance over there.

822
01:28:48,220 --> 01:28:50,541
Well then, may you always be happy.

823
01:30:06,073 --> 01:30:07,033
Isomura-san.

824
01:30:34,215 --> 01:30:34,989
Reiko-san.

825
01:30:58,403 --> 01:31:04,920
THE END

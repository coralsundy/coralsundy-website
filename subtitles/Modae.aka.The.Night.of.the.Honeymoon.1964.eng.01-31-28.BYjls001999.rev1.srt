Modae / The Night of the Honeymoon (1964)

3
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:26,168
The bride and groom will now depart for their honeymoon in Hakone!

4
00:01:27,168 --> 00:01:31,911
Please send them off with a round of applause to celebrate their new beginnings!

5
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:42,812
Congratulations.

6
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:53,630
Hello.

7
00:01:54,184 --> 00:01:55,012
I'm so jealous!

8
00:01:55,294 --> 00:01:58,083
She lets her husband carry all the luggage.

9
00:01:58,419 --> 00:02:00,145
The beginning of everything is important.

10
00:02:00,755 --> 00:02:02,028
Thank you very much.

11
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:02,880
Take care!

12
00:02:04,076 --> 00:02:05,997
Take care!

13
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:07,943
Have a safe trip.

14
00:02:07,968 --> 00:02:08,732
Thank you.

15
00:02:08,787 --> 00:02:11,349
Take care!

16
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:14,003
Have a safe trip.

17
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:41,126
The ceremony we just had.

18
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,995
I am now at the gate of marriage.

19
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:00,253
Tonight I will be a married woman.

20
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:04,167
My heart is filled with both anxiety and anticipation.

21
00:03:05,534 --> 00:03:09,682
But I will gladly go to my new life as a wife

22
00:03:20,656 --> 00:03:23,265
The bath is ready.

23
00:03:23,718 --> 00:03:24,187
Thank you.

24
00:03:47,456 --> 00:03:50,604
If you need me, please call me.

25
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:52,065
Thank you.

26
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,995
Good night.

27
00:03:55,525 --> 00:03:58,384
Something is closing in on me.

28
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:02,634
My heart is stepping back into the unknown

29
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:06,361
My skin is already waiting for it

30
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,380
You take bath first.

31
00:04:14,685 --> 00:04:17,138
I'll take later.
You first.

32
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:18,685
I'll take later.

33
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,240
Thanks.

34
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:22,959
Go ahead.

35
00:05:59,956 --> 00:06:01,620
Excuse me.

36
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:32,328
It was a very nice bath.

37
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:34,953
What are you looking at?

38
00:06:36,156 --> 00:06:36,680
A novel.

39
00:06:38,359 --> 00:06:39,765
Take the bath.

40
00:06:58,477 --> 00:07:00,641
Oh, you're not going to take a bath?

41
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:04,695
I'm a little tired, so I just wiped myself down.

42
00:07:04,891 --> 00:07:06,039
Are you in a bad mood?

43
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,430
No no.

44
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,356
Good night.

45
00:07:52,748 --> 00:07:53,615
Good night.

46
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,833
We are still a couple in form only.

47
00:09:27,388 --> 00:09:29,755
I've really extended my day to be a wife by a day.

48
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:34,216
I resent my husband's extra thoughtfulness.

49
00:09:39,467 --> 00:09:42,303
But Shoichiro is a really kind man.

50
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:49,890
I'm happy.

51
00:09:51,288 --> 00:09:52,202
Same here.

52
00:10:24,327 --> 00:10:24,959
Here it is.

53
00:10:29,654 --> 00:10:32,264
That's the road you just drove down.

54
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,818
I'm going to play.

55
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,350
Foe what?

56
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:44,842
I saw a pool at the main building.

57
00:10:45,014 --> 00:10:46,936
You're going now? I'm coming with you.

58
00:10:47,694 --> 00:10:48,655
Can you play?

59
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,858
I can't, but you have to teach me.

60
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:52,920
It's not that easy.

61
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,809
I brought you some fruit.

62
00:11:38,099 --> 00:11:40,075
I didn't ask for it.

63
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:44,215
Your husband told me to deliver it to you.

64
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,349
I see.

65
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,458
He's dancing so happily.

66
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:52,200
I don't really like that kind of play.

67
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:53,778
What do you mean by that?

68
00:11:54,075 --> 00:11:57,294
I think they should just enjoy themselves.

69
00:11:58,692 --> 00:12:01,622
You just got married, but you're alone and lonely.

70
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:04,325
Why don't you take the rest and wait?

71
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,498
Excuse me.

72
00:12:51,331 --> 00:12:54,214
You and your wife are a perfect match.

73
00:12:54,753 --> 00:12:58,847
I am very honored to have it.

74
00:12:59,213 --> 00:13:02,963
Among our friends, we think your wife will be a great person.

75
00:13:03,792 --> 00:13:06,839
Because he is a great feminist

76
00:13:07,409 --> 00:13:09,284
I envy you.

77
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:13,456
I'm happy for you

78
00:13:29,281 --> 00:13:30,281
Welcome back.

79
00:13:30,415 --> 00:13:31,891
You didn't sleep yet?

80
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:33,696
I was waiting for you.

81
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,700
I'm going to write a letter.

82
00:13:37,965 --> 00:13:39,622
Why don't you write tomorrow?

83
00:13:39,747 --> 00:13:41,551
No, I'll write when I feel like it.

84
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,718
You go ahead and get some rest.

85
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:10,660
What's the matter?

86
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:13,621
You don't like me.

87
00:14:14,043 --> 00:14:15,449
Maybe you like someone else.

88
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,480
Tell me.

89
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,363
I'm going back to Tokyo.

90
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:22,121
Tell me.

91
00:14:23,118 --> 00:14:24,594
Don't get me wrong.

92
00:14:25,915 --> 00:14:27,188
I like you.

93
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:29,313
That's why I married you.

94
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,290
You are so terrible.

95
00:14:32,063 --> 00:14:33,696
Because this is too much.

96
00:14:37,165 --> 00:14:39,399
Forgive me.
I'm sorry.

97
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:47,360
I tried to be honest with you but I can't have sex.

98
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:50,931
What do you mean?

99
00:14:52,298 --> 00:14:55,728
I was in a car accident the year before last.

100
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,775
The man's nerves were ruined.

101
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:07,951
The doctor said he'd be fine.
So I got engaged, thinking I'd be better by the time of the wedding.

102
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,584
But it's not gonna work.

103
00:15:12,927 --> 00:15:13,810
So..

104
00:15:15,568 --> 00:15:18,123
I'm not worthy of being a man.

105
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:27,341
During the wedding and after you're here. With your charm.
I've tried so hard to make up for what I've lost.

106
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:30,566
But it's not gonna work.

107
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,714
Forgive me.

108
00:15:34,964 --> 00:15:37,753
I'm sure you're disappointed.
I've been too selfish.

109
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,707
I'm at your disposal.

110
00:15:43,043 --> 00:15:50,316
If need be, I am willing to humiliate myself and publicly disclose my flaws to prove your innocence.

111
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:53,238
I didn't know that.

112
00:15:54,363 --> 00:15:56,980
I thought you hated me.

113
00:15:57,262 --> 00:16:02,121
I love you.
Please believe me on this.

114
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:07,189
I was wondering if we should postpone the ceremony until I was healed.

115
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:12,362
But the doctor said there was a chance that marriage could cure me.

116
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:19,065
I wanted to marry you no matter what.

117
00:16:20,132 --> 00:16:21,374
That's true.

118
00:16:22,194 --> 00:16:28,632
I'm so happy that you thought of me.

119
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:33,530
You don't know what it's like to be a woman.

120
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:37,132
I don't just want sex.

121
00:16:37,945 --> 00:16:39,757
That's what makes me different from men.

122
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:43,601
We're not only married for our bodies.

123
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:47,585
And it's curable, right?

124
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,937
The doctor said so.

125
00:16:50,163 --> 00:16:54,570
Then let's work together to cure it.
We are a couple.

126
00:16:56,689 --> 00:16:57,478
Chieko.

127
00:17:00,595 --> 00:17:04,103
And...
Let's be a beautiful couple.

128
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,110
Thank you.

129
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:10,006
Thank you.

130
00:18:17,383 --> 00:18:18,837
Good morning.

131
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,923
He's sleeping well. Please don't wake him.

132
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,274
why don't you go to the hot spring pool?
Over there.

133
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:08,507
Let's swim together.

134
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,777
Oh.

135
00:19:19,316 --> 00:19:20,464
Chieko.

136
00:19:21,988 --> 00:19:23,542
It's been a while.

137
00:19:23,613 --> 00:19:24,933
Since graduation?

138
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:25,417
Are you alone?

139
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,339
My husband is here.

140
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,191
Are you newlyweds?

141
00:19:29,394 --> 00:19:29,956
What about you?

142
00:19:29,989 --> 00:19:32,792
I'm here in Recreation.
I missed out on getting married.

143
00:19:32,832 --> 00:19:35,972
Well, you can only have so much fun while you still can.
I envy you.

144
00:19:36,284 --> 00:19:41,893
And you're not here to play, are you?It's on the third floor of the main building.
I'm with these guys. They're all very interesting people.

145
00:19:42,183 --> 00:19:43,152
I'd go.

146
00:19:43,464 --> 00:19:44,831
Bring your husband.

147
00:20:06,968 --> 00:20:08,116
Are you awake?

148
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:11,577
You slept so well.
I went for a walk.

149
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:14,374
You didn't run away, did you?

150
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,663
Don't be kidding.

151
00:20:25,373 --> 00:20:26,459
Thanks so much.

152
00:20:34,937 --> 00:20:35,898
We can't?

153
00:20:36,835 --> 00:20:39,749
If I kiss you, you'll do more than that.

154
00:20:40,593 --> 00:20:41,741
I'm afraid of that.

155
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:44,249
That's not gonna happen.

156
00:20:45,749 --> 00:20:48,507
Please go back to bed and take off your pajamas.

157
00:20:49,851 --> 00:20:50,484
Why?

158
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:56,773
I've been trying to get you washed in hot water since before we were married.

159
00:20:57,121 --> 00:21:00,480
This feels so good.

160
00:21:01,089 --> 00:21:02,230
Thanks so much.

161
00:21:08,639 --> 00:21:10,342
Lie face down.

162
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:18,930
The year before last, the other car's brakes went out, and I hit this spot.

163
00:21:23,477 --> 00:21:27,945
I don't know how much more I can take from you.

164
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:33,336
We bonded more strongly last night than any married couple ever has.

165
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,914
I feel as if I've already settled down with your wife.

166
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:43,275
I feel as if you're mine now.

167
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,299
Let's stop talking like this.

168
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,072
I just met a friend from high school at the pool.

169
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:53,165
She invited me to come visit them.

170
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:53,978
Please go.

171
00:21:54,338 --> 00:21:55,986
She invited you too.

172
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,197
I don't wanna go.

173
00:21:57,978 --> 00:22:02,057
I want to fully enjoy my stay-at-home husband's company.

174
00:22:07,783 --> 00:22:09,470
You won.

175
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:10,986
Keep going.

176
00:22:11,048 --> 00:22:11,962
Come on.

177
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:18,532
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you.
This is my friend from high school, Chieko.

178
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:20,126
They're all boyfriends and friends.

179
00:22:20,314 --> 00:22:21,470
I'm Ueda. Nice to meet you.

180
00:22:21,495 --> 00:22:22,462
Nice to meet you.

181
00:22:22,767 --> 00:22:24,337
Are you newlyweds?

182
00:22:24,439 --> 00:22:26,720
How about you bring your husband along?

183
00:22:26,868 --> 00:22:28,884
He's not feeling well.

184
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:31,993
Because you had a lot of sex?

185
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:36,502
Good morning.

186
00:22:36,611 --> 00:22:38,057
You overslept.

187
00:22:38,174 --> 00:22:39,385
She was always with me.

188
00:22:40,197 --> 00:22:42,252
It's so nice to be in love.

189
00:22:42,494 --> 00:22:43,268
She's my friend.

190
00:22:45,205 --> 00:22:46,135
How about your wife?

191
00:22:46,228 --> 00:22:47,252
She's sleeping.

192
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:49,971
Let's enjoy time together.

193
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:58,912
Do you think they look bad? Actually, police officers and civil servants are people with serious occupations.

194
00:23:03,868 --> 00:23:05,204
You guys look like you're having a good time.

195
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:08,454
Here it is.

196
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,689
I can't drink.

197
00:23:09,798 --> 00:23:13,993
You come in here, have a drink, get your freak on.

198
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:16,697
It's a way to forget the angst of reality.

199
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,540
You worry about her husband?

200
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:22,040
I don't care. I don't care.
He's tired. That's bad.

201
00:23:23,587 --> 00:23:24,923
Have a drink.

202
00:23:49,117 --> 00:23:50,344
What are your thoughts on the marriage?

203
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,152
I'll leave that to your imagination.

204
00:23:54,863 --> 00:23:55,792
Let me guess.

205
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,441
Disappointing, of course.

206
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,535
No way.
You're rude.

207
00:24:02,972 --> 00:24:07,042
I know what on your mind.
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here playing.

208
00:24:07,597 --> 00:24:08,785
Well, I'm leaving.

209
00:24:09,151 --> 00:24:09,822
I won't give it back.

210
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,472
I fell in love with you.

211
00:24:11,636 --> 00:24:12,535
That's bad.

212
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,980
It's your fault.

213
00:24:20,314 --> 00:24:22,384
Don't get jealous.

214
00:24:50,982 --> 00:24:53,404
I think marriage is a stupid habit.

215
00:24:54,248 --> 00:24:57,263
The only thing between a man and a woman is their instincts, and that's all that matters.

216
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,607
But there is love between a husband and wife.

217
00:25:00,162 --> 00:25:02,217
That's not why marriage is worth it.

218
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,811
That's ridiculous.

219
00:25:04,076 --> 00:25:07,381
Why don't we just live from the heart?

220
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:10,459
Let go of your hypocrisy.

221
00:25:10,881 --> 00:25:14,787
Is this a theory of life?
There's no need to think so hard.

222
00:25:15,455 --> 00:25:16,869
Just enjoy the life in front of you.

223
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:19,618
Yes.
Be thorough.

224
00:25:20,134 --> 00:25:22,119
I'm thorough in my own way.

225
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,994
I want to be affectionate above all else.

226
00:25:26,603 --> 00:25:30,986
But a woman's body doesn't work that way.
I have to say.

227
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:35,955
I think you'll get divorced in six months and we'll join the group.

228
00:25:36,205 --> 00:25:37,197
You think so?

229
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,711
Hello?
Who?

230
00:25:45,297 --> 00:25:46,196
Ueda?

231
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:50,110
My wife is supposed to be there.

232
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:52,703
Hold on.
Your husband.

233
00:25:54,078 --> 00:25:55,696
Oh you.

234
00:25:56,758 --> 00:26:00,821
Sorry.
I'm leaving right now.

235
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,037
I'm sorry I'm late.

236
00:26:12,928 --> 00:26:14,068
Did you have fun?

237
00:26:14,248 --> 00:26:16,334
Yeah, it's been a while.

238
00:26:17,906 --> 00:26:19,109
You're angry?

239
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:23,195
Tell me.

240
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:26,499
I knew you regretted marrying me.

241
00:26:27,648 --> 00:26:29,241
That's why you didn't want to come back.

242
00:26:29,874 --> 00:26:31,343
Well, I didn't mean it like that.

243
00:26:34,383 --> 00:26:35,281
Chieko.

244
00:26:36,664 --> 00:26:38,187
What's wrong?

245
00:27:58,423 --> 00:27:59,681
Are you ok?

246
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:01,689
Don't look at me.

247
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:10,274
I can't..

248
00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:12,549
I can't..

249
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:17,120
I can't..

250
00:28:21,941 --> 00:28:24,441
You shouldn't be in such a hurry.

251
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:29,972
We just made a promise to each other that we'd stay rational until you got better.

252
00:28:30,027 --> 00:28:32,894
That's why I'm afraid you'll leave.

253
00:28:32,964 --> 00:28:34,519
No worries.

254
00:28:35,503 --> 00:28:38,480
If I didn't love you, I'd have run away this morning.

255
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:44,089
If you're too pessimistic, I'll still be unhappy.

256
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:50,367
Cheer up.
Let's go have a cold drink.

257
00:28:56,391 --> 00:28:57,258
Welcome.

258
00:28:57,516 --> 00:28:58,273
Please.

259
00:29:01,185 --> 00:29:01,989
Hey, Chief.

260
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,442
You're here, too.

261
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,161
I took a vacation.

262
00:29:07,294 --> 00:29:08,169
Are you alone?

263
00:29:08,239 --> 00:29:09,833
Just a couple of friends.

264
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:11,419
He's Ishikawa.

265
00:29:11,669 --> 00:29:12,333
My wife.

266
00:29:12,825 --> 00:29:15,724
Nice to meet you.
He's always been a great help to me.

267
00:29:15,856 --> 00:29:17,325
Congratulations.

268
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,841
Let's have a drink together.

269
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,833
Please.

270
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,136
I'll excuse.

271
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:31,597
Come join us for just one drink.

272
00:29:31,863 --> 00:29:33,074
Thanks.

273
00:29:34,595 --> 00:29:35,392
what do you drink?

274
00:29:35,962 --> 00:29:37,025
I'll have brandy.

275
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,806
I'll have coke.

276
00:29:39,017 --> 00:29:40,447
I'll have whiskey.

277
00:29:43,387 --> 00:29:45,341
You'll have to get a wife soon.

278
00:29:45,692 --> 00:29:47,216
I'm sure you've got plenty girls.

279
00:29:47,356 --> 00:29:51,614
I'm surrounded by an icy desert.
It's a cold world without sun.

280
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:55,614
It's not like you.

281
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:58,395
I'm jealous.
You got a very nice wife.

282
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,817
May I dance with her?

283
00:30:03,497 --> 00:30:04,450
Go ahead.

284
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:07,687
Thanks.

285
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:13,491
Here it is.

286
00:30:25,845 --> 00:30:27,517
I was surprised that the section manager is your husband.

287
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:29,181
What a coincidence.

288
00:30:41,819 --> 00:30:43,507
Look, look, your husband is jealous of us.

289
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:47,937
Don't tell anyone, but see me from time to time.

290
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:49,500
I can't..

291
00:30:53,273 --> 00:30:54,133
Welcome.

292
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:01,570
Who?

293
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:03,499
Shit.

294
00:31:05,901 --> 00:31:08,276
What's wrong,Sadao?

295
00:31:08,385 --> 00:31:09,706
They are the company's section chief and his wife.

296
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,456
Nice to meet you.

297
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:15,815
You are sometimes away from home for three days without saying a word.
It took me half a day to find a place to stay!

298
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,167
She's my aunt, Fusaki Shirako.

299
00:31:18,213 --> 00:31:19,104
she is a beautician.

300
00:31:19,143 --> 00:31:23,025
Yes I know.
Nice to meet you.

301
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:27,870
He's my nephew. He's a real pain in the ass.
He often goes out without telling me.

302
00:31:27,948 --> 00:31:28,854
Let's go home.

303
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:29,995
You're kind of rude.

304
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:33,354
Because you are bad.
I beg your pardon.

305
00:31:33,854 --> 00:31:34,612
See you.

306
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:49,186
I was in despair about my body until yesterday.
But today I have hope.

307
00:31:50,022 --> 00:31:53,319
Maybe the doctor's right, maybe marrying you will cure me.

308
00:31:53,522 --> 00:31:54,530
Really?

309
00:31:55,937 --> 00:32:00,272
You were dancing with him earlier and I was so jealous.

310
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:07,566
So I think if you go with another man I'll be so excited that I'll be cured of my illness.

311
00:32:07,878 --> 00:32:09,433
You're kidding.

312
00:32:10,704 --> 00:32:13,907
You know, Ishikawa, he has a serious face at the office, but he's quite a playboy.

313
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:15,376
Think about it.

314
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:17,821
Are you serious?

315
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:22,493
I'm starting to get the feeling that this is where the doctor meant for me to go.

316
00:32:23,165 --> 00:32:24,797
I decline.

317
00:32:25,446 --> 00:32:30,774
You're not getting any unnatural stimulation, and I'm fine the way I am.

318
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:38,002
From now on, don't tell me about it.
I hope you won't even think about it.

319
00:32:38,533 --> 00:32:41,158
I see.
Sorry.

320
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,041
Do you want to take this home?

321
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,244
I'm sorry for everything.
Your husband ok?

322
00:32:55,557 --> 00:32:57,994
Don't worry.
He's concern about you.

323
00:32:59,933 --> 00:33:01,105
Can't you have a baby yet?

324
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:02,504
Not yet.

325
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:04,738
How's Shuichiro?

326
00:33:05,238 --> 00:33:06,699
He's very healthy.

327
00:33:08,922 --> 00:33:10,250
Would he be so kind?

328
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:13,164
Yes he is.

329
00:33:14,211 --> 00:33:17,328
I wipe him down every morning.

330
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:22,016
He is very calm like a baby while I wash him.

331
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:25,276
He comes home on time every night.?

332
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:27,456
Yeah, why?

333
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:35,799
Actually, your father saw him get into a car with a strange woman in Ginza.

334
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:38,221
What kind of woman?

335
00:33:39,213 --> 00:33:41,323
He said she might be bar girl.

336
00:33:44,752 --> 00:33:49,237
I'm worried about you because you've been so down lately.

337
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,735
Are things going well with you?

338
00:33:53,321 --> 00:33:58,344
Of course we're doing fine.

339
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,630
Welcome home.

340
00:34:14,247 --> 00:34:15,333
Come in.

341
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,239
He's Dr. Terada.

342
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:18,333
M wife.

343
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:21,552
I'm glad to meet you.

344
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:23,988
I'm Dr. Terada of Principle Therapy.

345
00:34:24,013 --> 00:34:26,020
My husband has always been a great help.

346
00:34:26,388 --> 00:34:27,302
Come in.

347
00:34:32,664 --> 00:34:34,852
It is quite a splendid residence!

348
00:34:34,877 --> 00:34:39,328
No way.
Would you like to have a drink while you treat yourself?

349
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:44,500
I'm very sorry, but I'll have.
Thanks.

350
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:46,469
Please bring ice and water.

351
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,635
Did you buy this house?

352
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:50,589
Yes.

353
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,612
I think the price was high.

354
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,237
I'll have it.

355
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,237
Go ahead.

356
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,933
Shall we start?

357
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,659
Where?

358
00:35:03,933 --> 00:35:05,237
Here's fine.

359
00:35:08,234 --> 00:35:09,828
Do you want to eat dinner?

360
00:35:10,703 --> 00:35:11,914
I ate out.

361
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:14,422
Someone invited?

362
00:35:14,961 --> 00:35:19,547
I finished my meal while waiting for my teacher in Ginza.

363
00:35:29,149 --> 00:35:29,984
Excuse me.

364
00:35:39,926 --> 00:35:42,457
I knew you had a problem with your third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.

365
00:35:56,732 --> 00:36:01,217
I am the only one who can cure your husband's illness.

366
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:07,189
I'm sorry to hear you're ill with such a beautiful wife.

367
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:11,627
It must be hard for you, too.
But please be patient for a while longer

368
00:36:12,353 --> 00:36:16,400
I'm sure I'll make you happy.

369
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:21,212
Life is very difficult when you have this disease.

370
00:36:26,808 --> 00:36:31,761
My patient suddenly disappeared at her home.

371
00:36:32,472 --> 00:36:34,128
It's not because of marital quarrels.

372
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:00,245
Are you still late tomorrow?

373
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,463
Why?

374
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:07,143
These days, even if I cook, you don't eat it, so it goes to waste.

375
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:12,947
I have to invite the Kyushu branch manager tomorrow, so I'll be home around this time.

376
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,450
He's leaving.

377
00:37:56,872 --> 00:38:00,473
Come to see me again.

378
00:38:07,883 --> 00:38:09,765
Do you drink brandy?

379
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,539
Same here.

380
00:38:11,937 --> 00:38:13,703
I want beer.

381
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,359
You guys are good friends.

382
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:17,008
Don't be jealous.

383
00:38:19,383 --> 00:38:21,265
Oh my god.

384
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,461
Bring ice.

385
00:38:26,529 --> 00:38:27,599
What's the hell?

386
00:38:27,826 --> 00:38:28,646
Nothing.

387
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:41,773
Chieko, come on.

388
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:43,786
It's me.

389
00:38:44,692 --> 00:38:46,044
Oh mitsuko.

390
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:48,809
Thanks for the other night.

391
00:38:48,919 --> 00:38:50,176
You look scared.

392
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,528
Nothing.

393
00:38:51,553 --> 00:38:54,536
I'm going to Shiraki's beauty salon now. Wanna go out with me?

394
00:38:54,684 --> 00:38:56,786
It'll be fun.

395
00:38:58,567 --> 00:39:00,122
Get in the car.

396
00:39:18,806 --> 00:39:23,587
Oh  madam.
Thank you very much for the other day

397
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:25,056
Sorry to bother you.

398
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,861
You look so nice.

399
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,197
But I think it would be better to expand it a little bit like this.

400
00:39:33,556 --> 00:39:36,197
Where's Sadao?

401
00:39:36,642 --> 00:39:38,509
Do you have something to do with him?

402
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:39,712
Kind of.

403
00:39:40,502 --> 00:39:45,142
He's been attracted to someone else for a while now.
He seems to be having a hard time.

404
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,189
She must be me.

405
00:39:48,978 --> 00:39:53,830
I'm thinking of marrying to Sadao.

406
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,236
He doesn't take you seriously.

407
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,361
Excuse me, ma'am.

408
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,159
Sorry to keep you waiting.

409
00:40:16,726 --> 00:40:19,742
Are you really going to marry Mr. Ishikawa?

410
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:22,593
That's a lie.
I was just teasing.

411
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,773
It's funny how she gets so mad when I mention him.

412
00:40:26,406 --> 00:40:28,312
she has a very short temper.

413
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:34,320
She seems to get very excited when she gets jealous.

414
00:40:34,757 --> 00:40:37,968
Mr. Ishikawa and her are blood related, right?

415
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,617
He's her nephew, but he's the nephew of her deceased husband.

416
00:40:42,249 --> 00:40:45,484
I mean, he is a young swallows.

417
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:47,460
I see.

418
00:40:48,648 --> 00:40:50,515
He's crazy about her too?

419
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:54,656
I hear you're interested in him, too.

420
00:40:55,008 --> 00:40:56,758
I'm not.

421
00:40:57,141 --> 00:40:59,031
It's okay. You don't have to hide it.

422
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:01,726
You're not happy with your husband.

423
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:03,492
No...

424
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:04,828
It's written on your face.

425
00:41:05,836 --> 00:41:10,922
Maybe it's time you joined our group.
I'll make it fun for you.

426
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,187
Can you come next Saturday?

427
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,476
I can't.

428
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:16,859
You say that, but secretly you want to go.

429
00:41:17,617 --> 00:41:19,891
Well, whenever you feel like it.

430
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:24,359
You need to take better care of yourself.

431
00:41:25,008 --> 00:41:29,422
Look at us.
And live like a human being.

432
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,756
Where the hell did you go?
It's already 0:30 a.m.

433
00:41:39,537 --> 00:41:43,365
I went to the hairdresser and then to Roppongi.

434
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:46,256
What did you do in Roppongi?

435
00:41:52,669 --> 00:41:54,981
I think you're getting tired of living with me.

436
00:41:57,983 --> 00:42:01,327
Why don't you just tell me what you really want?

437
00:42:02,873 --> 00:42:04,428
I'm sure you'd like to have more fun.

438
00:42:07,006 --> 00:42:08,194
What did you do in Roppongi?

439
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:13,599
Men are so free.
Once they're out, they can do whatever they want and come home and be fine.

440
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:16,842
A woman can be blamed for the slightest thing.

441
00:42:17,061 --> 00:42:19,631
What's your point?

442
00:42:20,116 --> 00:42:24,670
Don't pretend you don't know.
I saw you at the bar with a woman.

443
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:35,437
Chieko.

444
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:38,546
You're terrible.

445
00:42:39,234 --> 00:42:42,515
You were with that woman every night.

446
00:42:43,866 --> 00:42:49,015
I was meeting with that woman for treatment of my body.

447
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,398
Please don't make excuses like that.

448
00:42:52,874 --> 00:42:54,023
I want to die.

449
00:42:55,421 --> 00:42:59,687
I think I'm going crazy.

450
00:43:03,303 --> 00:43:08,787
Even my own wife makes fun of me because of my body.

451
00:43:09,334 --> 00:43:12,467
We're over.

452
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:17,201
I don't know what to do.

453
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:23,709
Don't run away, please.

454
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:24,506
No.

455
00:43:24,732 --> 00:43:28,568
I can't live if you run away.

456
00:43:29,459 --> 00:43:30,334
No..

457
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:45,586
Chieko.

458
00:44:43,942 --> 00:44:47,192
I did it again...

459
00:44:52,166 --> 00:44:55,901
Don't be disappointed.
It's a sign that you're getting better.

460
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:04,650
Don't go to the bar.
Let's cure it with the power of just the two of us

461
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,190
I'm sorry,
I won't go out with her anymore.

462
00:45:25,855 --> 00:45:29,167
I'll be home early tonight.

463
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,355
Do me a favor.

464
00:45:32,503 --> 00:45:33,449
What?

465
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:40,339
Now I'd like to go on an overnight trip with a class reunion on Saturday and Sunday, if you don't mind if I go.

466
00:45:41,034 --> 00:45:42,089
Class reunion? Really?

467
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:45,035
It's true.
Sawaki is coming, too.

468
00:45:50,726 --> 00:45:52,234
He's jealous...

469
00:45:56,734 --> 00:46:00,898
I'm going for him.
Don't be afraid.

470
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:05,583
Three congratulatory gifts for the pair.

471
00:46:05,848 --> 00:46:06,512
You?

472
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:07,692
Call.

473
00:46:08,169 --> 00:46:10,919
If I lose any more, the wife will scold me.

474
00:46:10,981 --> 00:46:12,176
Why did you ever get married?

475
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,926
Marriage is the graveyard of life.

476
00:46:16,012 --> 00:46:17,567
I feel sorry for wives.

477
00:46:18,497 --> 00:46:20,473
Thanks for coming.

478
00:46:21,481 --> 00:46:23,442
But I guess I should go home now

479
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:29,027
We come here to free ourselves, escape from society and relax.

480
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:32,489
That's what this group is for.

481
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:36,254
I understand.
Is that all?

482
00:46:37,771 --> 00:46:39,467
You're just waiting for Suda?

483
00:46:39,982 --> 00:46:41,342
No way.

484
00:46:41,623 --> 00:46:43,201
He's into you.

485
00:46:44,287 --> 00:46:46,045
I know.

486
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,623
He's coming.

487
00:46:53,371 --> 00:46:54,949
You came late.

488
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:56,965
What's the matter, are you late or something?

489
00:46:57,261 --> 00:47:01,433
I'm having trouble because my section manager has invited me to play golf tomorrow.

490
00:47:01,847 --> 00:47:02,636
My husband?

491
00:47:03,113 --> 00:47:05,871
He noticed that I was a member of this group.

492
00:47:09,275 --> 00:47:11,189
Haha I was kidding.

493
00:47:11,565 --> 00:47:13,135
He was waiting for you.

494
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,252
I should go home now

495
00:47:17,596 --> 00:47:21,806
No, no.
Forget about everything but your own pleasure.

496
00:47:32,597 --> 00:47:36,394
I missed you so much.
I can't tell you how many times I wanted to call you.

497
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:40,526
Don't get nervous.

498
00:47:41,105 --> 00:47:42,151
No..

499
00:47:42,956 --> 00:47:47,792
You're pure.
That's what I love about you.

500
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:19,323
Stop it.

501
00:48:20,019 --> 00:48:20,651
Don't worry.

502
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:21,636
No..

503
00:48:23,308 --> 00:48:24,534
Stop it.

504
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:29,824
Don't touch my body.

505
00:48:30,644 --> 00:48:31,113
Why?

506
00:48:31,222 --> 00:48:32,152
Stop it.

507
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:41,105
You are dry.
Men find a thirsty woman attractive.

508
00:48:43,092 --> 00:48:48,561
Ma'am, you're not a child.
You know what you're doing here.

509
00:48:49,709 --> 00:48:53,295
I can't betray my husband.

510
00:48:54,389 --> 00:48:56,287
That kind of sentimentalism doesn't make sense.

511
00:48:57,209 --> 00:49:02,490
Let's just remain close friends.

512
00:49:02,515 --> 00:49:04,491
Don't make it sound like a novel.

513
00:49:05,584 --> 00:49:08,990
You don't like me?
You like me.

514
00:49:09,944 --> 00:49:12,287
If you like each other, what's wrong with being physical?

515
00:49:12,936 --> 00:49:14,514
Anyway, I'm going home today.

516
00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:15,201
No.

517
00:49:16,303 --> 00:49:17,670
Please

518
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:18,967
I want you.

519
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:19,498
No.

520
00:49:19,592 --> 00:49:20,319
I want you.

521
00:49:23,152 --> 00:49:24,082
Let me go.

522
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,480
Let me go.

523
00:49:28,866 --> 00:49:30,765
Forgive me..

524
00:49:37,362 --> 00:49:39,104
Stop it..

525
00:49:39,753 --> 00:49:41,675
I can't hold back.

526
00:49:53,181 --> 00:49:56,829
You're not sure if you're inviting guys or being nice.

527
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:01,196
You are too old fashioned.

528
00:50:02,173 --> 00:50:03,806
I am disappointed in you.

529
00:50:10,484 --> 00:50:11,742
May I help you?

530
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:14,156
She's waiting.

531
00:50:18,846 --> 00:50:20,221
May I help you?

532
00:50:21,627 --> 00:50:23,979
Please bring cold water.

533
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,566
I wasn't wrong.

534
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:37,355
I wasn't wrong.

535
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:45,488
It's Sunday.
I'll make myself at home.

536
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:48,809
Lie down.

537
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:02,341
Do you want to have a baby?

538
00:51:02,638 --> 00:51:05,911
Baby? but..

539
00:51:06,177 --> 00:51:09,333
There's also the artificial conception method.

540
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,208
Dr. Terada came to my office yesterday and recommended it.

541
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,747
He said he'd carry it off in secret.

542
00:51:18,770 --> 00:51:21,794
I want to have a baby, but I don't want it.

543
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:26,255
I'm sure he's colluding with some doctor, because he's a shrewd guy.

544
00:51:27,216 --> 00:51:30,099
But I want you to have a baby, too.

545
00:51:31,232 --> 00:51:33,872
As long as we have a child, things will settle down between us.

546
00:51:35,029 --> 00:51:38,333
Are you sure you can love a child that isn't yours?

547
00:51:39,154 --> 00:51:41,161
I could love your child.

548
00:51:42,091 --> 00:51:46,841
I have a very talented young man working for me.
I'm willing to ask him to do it.

549
00:51:47,950 --> 00:51:48,849
Who?

550
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:51,279
I can't tell.

551
00:51:53,888 --> 00:51:55,825
I wonder if he is Ishikawa..

552
00:51:56,958 --> 00:51:58,263
Why you think so?

553
00:51:59,185 --> 00:52:01,279
Because you said he's your man.

554
00:52:01,677 --> 00:52:04,185
No, he's a much better young man than him.

555
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,294
Or maybe you should ask Terada-san to pick someone who doesn't know each other at all.

556
00:52:12,232 --> 00:52:14,450
I'm worried about whether you're in love with that person.

557
00:52:24,499 --> 00:52:25,725
Oh you.

558
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:27,007
Good morning.

559
00:52:27,366 --> 00:52:29,100
I've come to ask a favor of you.

560
00:52:29,499 --> 00:52:30,913
Come in.

561
00:52:37,484 --> 00:52:38,648
Thank you for the other day.

562
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:41,656
 I'm sorry to bother you.

563
00:52:41,984 --> 00:52:43,273
Please.

564
00:52:43,298 --> 00:52:44,164
I have some business to attend to.

565
00:52:45,304 --> 00:52:46,476
Have a seat.

566
00:52:46,632 --> 00:52:47,789
What would you like?

567
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,617
Cold tea please.

568
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:52,968
Here's nice place.

569
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,257
This is good kitchen.

570
00:52:58,921 --> 00:53:03,234
What I mean is...
I'd like you to visit us often.

571
00:53:04,226 --> 00:53:08,039
Because Sadao is always out of home.

572
00:53:09,054 --> 00:53:12,312
I've been thinking about it a lot, trying to calm him down, but...

573
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:13,890
Here's fine?

574
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,898
If he's with you I think he's at home.

575
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:20,533
I'm afraid..

576
00:53:20,558 --> 00:53:21,837
Please help me.

577
00:53:22,314 --> 00:53:25,400
He likes you so much.

578
00:53:26,267 --> 00:53:28,243
So I'm asking you.

579
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:44,669
Hello?

580
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:48,044
I'm Ishikawa.

581
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:52,646
A woman.
I'll connect you.

582
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,770
Hello?

583
00:53:58,356 --> 00:54:01,700
I'm Ishikawa, from Koi Bussan.
Who is this?

584
00:54:03,125 --> 00:54:04,609
I'm Ueda.

585
00:54:07,687 --> 00:54:08,703
Oh madam.

586
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,062
Sorry to call you.

587
00:54:12,289 --> 00:54:13,390
I don't mind.

588
00:54:13,578 --> 00:54:15,187
What's wrong?

589
00:54:15,984 --> 00:54:19,304
I'd like to meet with you to discuss some things.

590
00:54:19,937 --> 00:54:21,594
Can I see you?

591
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:26,164
Well..

592
00:54:27,437 --> 00:54:31,234
Well, we'll look into it, and we'll call you back.
We'll call you later.

593
00:54:31,469 --> 00:54:32,609
Thanks.

594
00:54:34,515 --> 00:54:35,344
Who was it?

595
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:39,148
Private call for me.
I'm going to go to the office.

596
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,229
Hi. it's Ueda.

597
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:56,448
Chieko-san?
Ishikawa here.

598
00:54:57,065 --> 00:55:00,112
The Chief is nearby.
It's not good if the exchange agent hears me.

599
00:55:00,643 --> 00:55:02,901
Please call me as Ishikawa's sister from now on.

600
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:05,034
I'm sorry for troubling you.

601
00:55:05,657 --> 00:55:08,759
I'm a little inconvenient tonight.

602
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,634
You have an appointment with someone?

603
00:55:12,243 --> 00:55:16,688
My aunt is setting up a blind date with me.

604
00:55:17,345 --> 00:55:19,368
I must meet with her.

605
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:22,251
I see.

606
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:27,488
I'm sure she's beautiful.

607
00:55:28,192 --> 00:55:29,231
I hope so.

608
00:55:31,307 --> 00:55:33,494
Hello?

609
00:55:34,510 --> 00:55:35,517
Are you upset?

610
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:40,861
I hope your blind date goes well.

611
00:55:53,567 --> 00:55:55,075
It's been a while.

612
00:55:56,473 --> 00:55:59,153
Ueda is at work.

613
00:55:59,978 --> 00:56:02,406
I'm here to see Mrs. Ueda.

614
00:56:02,740 --> 00:56:03,870
Excuse me.

615
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:10,667
Please come in.

616
00:56:16,143 --> 00:56:19,807
You must be bored.
Alone and without any pleasure.

617
00:56:26,176 --> 00:56:30,288
Actually...
I wonder if your husband told you about our little talk.

618
00:56:30,785 --> 00:56:32,014
I'm not sure what you mean.

619
00:56:33,236 --> 00:56:34,393
About artificial conception.

620
00:56:35,594 --> 00:56:40,324
Mr. Ueda is very enthusiastic. I wanted to bring it to you as soon as possible.

621
00:56:41,057 --> 00:56:45,503
I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to do that yet.

622
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:47,797
If we have a chance, please contact me.

623
00:56:48,287 --> 00:56:52,570
Please be considerate of your husband's feelings.

624
00:56:53,301 --> 00:56:56,554
Mr. Ueda, you want to bond with this family.

625
00:56:57,342 --> 00:57:02,790
He knows how much you are suffering because of his unhappiness.

626
00:57:02,896 --> 00:57:03,955
I understand.

627
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:08,436
Please give birth to a child for your husband.

628
00:57:09,303 --> 00:57:12,960
I will ask you then, but not now.

629
00:57:14,715 --> 00:57:19,281
I heard you attended a class reunion the other day.

630
00:57:19,658 --> 00:57:22,215
He's been neurotic ever since.

631
00:57:22,761 --> 00:57:29,444
He suspects you, but he's having a hard time saying it.

632
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:32,236
I have some shopping to do.

633
00:57:33,060 --> 00:57:34,587
I'll see you later.

634
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:38,450
But I'm not saying it's a bad thing

635
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:46,269
In case of emergency. It would be more convenient for you to have a conception.

636
00:57:46,788 --> 00:57:48,046
Don't be rude.

637
00:57:48,266 --> 00:57:51,802
I am very honest.

638
00:57:51,827 --> 00:57:58,855
When I see these unfortunate families, I take kindly to them.
Thank you for your time.

639
00:58:06,353 --> 00:58:07,802
I'll see you later.

640
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:14,379
Looks delicious!

641
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,083
I'll bake too.

642
00:58:16,282 --> 00:58:18,008
You cook well.

643
00:58:18,164 --> 00:58:20,529
Mr. Ueda's wife is here.

644
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:27,875
My aunt's a little concerned, so we decided we liked each other enough to get engaged.

645
00:58:27,953 --> 00:58:31,021
That'll make everything go more smoothly.

646
00:58:31,718 --> 00:58:34,794
But you know what? I don't like her.

647
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:36,385
In what way?

648
00:58:36,583 --> 00:58:42,137
She's too familiar with Sadao.

649
00:58:42,507 --> 00:58:44,488
Please try to judge her.

650
00:58:44,957 --> 00:58:45,937
Hey, guys.

651
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,395
Welcome.

652
00:58:50,689 --> 00:58:53,366
This is Miyakojima Shizuko-san.
This is Mr. Ueda's wife.

653
00:58:53,586 --> 00:58:55,128
I'm Ueda. Nice to meet you.

654
00:58:55,248 --> 00:58:57,386
You're beautiful.

655
00:58:57,521 --> 00:59:00,099
We've decided to get engaged.

656
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:03,231
It's only been two hours since you met.

657
00:59:03,537 --> 00:59:05,717
Why don't you try to get to know each other a little better?

658
00:59:05,742 --> 00:59:08,075
We like each other, don't we?

659
00:59:08,331 --> 00:59:09,865
Love at first sight, huh?

660
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,537
Please serve her.

661
00:59:13,977 --> 00:59:15,426
Would you like something to drink?

662
00:59:16,172 --> 00:59:18,096
I'll have brandy.

663
00:59:18,121 --> 00:59:22,287
I told you we're engaged, but I lied.
She just wanted to live in Tokyo.

664
00:59:22,478 --> 00:59:23,544
You are bad.

665
00:59:23,750 --> 00:59:25,163
When shall we meet again?

666
00:59:27,088 --> 00:59:28,494
Would you like something to drink?

667
00:59:28,672 --> 00:59:30,199
Don't worry.

668
00:59:30,224 --> 00:59:31,427
Don't be humble.

669
00:59:33,262 --> 00:59:36,437
Let's drink grape wine together.

670
00:59:36,856 --> 00:59:39,178
Let's have fun.

671
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:57,110
Oh, come on.
Dance with me again.

672
00:59:57,487 --> 01:00:00,626
No, you're gonna have to give it up.

673
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:06,642
One more time.

674
01:00:40,729 --> 01:00:41,687
Welcome back.

675
01:00:45,785 --> 01:00:47,043
Are you alright?

676
01:00:48,527 --> 01:00:50,433
Water, water.

677
01:00:53,793 --> 01:00:59,214
Where the hell have you been all day?
I called you three times.

678
01:00:59,801 --> 01:01:01,301
Here it is.

679
01:01:01,379 --> 01:01:03,496
At shiraki's house.

680
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,364
You went to see Ishikawa, didn't you?

681
01:01:11,692 --> 01:01:13,512
You must be very drunk.

682
01:01:13,614 --> 01:01:14,833
Tell me.

683
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,067
I want to talk to you tonight.

684
01:01:19,754 --> 01:01:20,551
Sit down.

685
01:01:29,069 --> 01:01:36,334
I'll be honest with you.
I went back to that place to see that woman again.

686
01:01:37,835 --> 01:01:39,382
And she laughed at me.

687
01:01:40,202 --> 01:01:41,522
I know I sound pathetic.

688
01:01:42,601 --> 01:01:45,554
I'm a really bad guy...

689
01:01:45,585 --> 01:01:47,233
I don't want to hear it.

690
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,569
Hey, wait a minute.

691
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:51,826
I want to hear you this time.

692
01:01:53,943 --> 01:01:56,397
You've been acting really weird lately.
What the hell did you do?

693
01:01:56,826 --> 01:01:58,303
There's nothing going on.

694
01:01:58,998 --> 01:02:04,053
Tell me the truth.
You're in the company of the crazy group.

695
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:07,615
That trip you took the other day was with that group, wasn't it?

696
01:02:08,686 --> 01:02:10,553
Tell me the truth.

697
01:02:11,115 --> 01:02:12,311
Tell me the truth.

698
01:02:13,764 --> 01:02:19,053
There's no such thing as a mistake. I'm as virgin as ever.

699
01:02:20,362 --> 01:02:21,370
Are you sure?

700
01:02:22,816 --> 01:02:23,589
Yes.

701
01:02:25,066 --> 01:02:30,573
And I don't want to undergo artificial conception because I want to remain a virgin until you're cured.

702
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:38,969
Okay. Okay.
Don't betray me.

703
01:02:42,087 --> 01:02:43,244
It's okay.

704
01:02:44,556 --> 01:02:47,923
You're never going to go out with that woman again,ok?

705
01:02:49,423 --> 01:02:54,525
If you're willing to try out your body on someone like that, why aren't you willing to try it on me?

706
01:02:56,078 --> 01:02:59,719
I would do anything for you.

707
01:03:01,274 --> 01:03:04,446
What's wrong with my body?

708
01:03:04,516 --> 01:03:06,258
Don't make me suffer so much.

709
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:34,600
Come on.

710
01:03:54,393 --> 01:03:55,135
Darling.

711
01:03:58,089 --> 01:03:59,417
Chieko.

712
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:06,785
It's okay.

713
01:04:08,058 --> 01:04:09,285
You don't have to do that.

714
01:04:09,542 --> 01:04:12,441
I am your wife.

715
01:04:12,894 --> 01:04:13,582
Chieko.

716
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,620
You are a poor person.

717
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,566
You are more pitiful than I am.

718
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:21,347
I need you.

719
01:04:23,355 --> 01:04:26,152
Thank you.

720
01:04:31,930 --> 01:04:33,735
I'm so pissed off.

721
01:04:36,305 --> 01:04:39,719
Sadao is going to marry that woman..

722
01:04:40,516 --> 01:04:45,070
If that little bitch takes Sadao away from me, all the hard work I put into taking care of him will be meaningless!

723
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,477
But it's an arranged marriage.

724
01:04:47,502 --> 01:04:49,383
Don't be so cruel.

725
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,251
Give me some water.

726
01:04:54,821 --> 01:04:58,540
I think he will listen to you.

727
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:01,172
I don't think there's anyone but you who can fix this situation.

728
01:05:01,945 --> 01:05:03,789
Do they get along well?

729
01:05:04,024 --> 01:05:07,555
They're like a married couple.

730
01:05:11,966 --> 01:05:13,005
I beg you.

731
01:05:13,974 --> 01:05:16,091
Then I'll talk to him.

732
01:05:21,861 --> 01:05:22,978
Sadao.

733
01:05:23,095 --> 01:05:23,782
Madam.

734
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:25,751
Sadao, where are you going?

735
01:05:25,776 --> 01:05:27,681
I promised my friends I'd go bowling.

736
01:05:28,509 --> 01:05:31,212
Chieko wants to talk to you.

737
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:33,954
She wants to talk to you in a small room on the third floor.

738
01:05:34,751 --> 01:05:35,384
Ok.

739
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,382
There's a room like this

740
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,356
This is the employee break room.

741
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:59,046
I can almost imagine what you're talking about.
My aunt asked you, didn't she?

742
01:06:02,913 --> 01:06:06,155
She's trying to get me and someone else to be friends in order to make her jealous.

743
01:06:06,624 --> 01:06:10,296
Shizuko's being used as a tool.
So are you.

744
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:12,085
I understand.

745
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:15,725
That's why I'm not here to help you play jealousy games with your aunt.

746
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:22,288
I have something important for me, and I was wondering if you could help me with it.

747
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:23,835
What is it?

748
01:06:25,053 --> 01:06:28,592
I'm thinking of having a conception.

749
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,038
A conception?

750
01:06:31,069 --> 01:06:35,921
Ueda lost his male faculties due to his car accident injuries.

751
01:06:37,647 --> 01:06:38,835
Poor guy.

752
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,811
I didn't know that.

753
01:06:42,608 --> 01:06:44,882
Please don't let anyone know about this.

754
01:06:45,014 --> 01:06:45,717
Ok.

755
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:48,319
So you want to talk to me about it?

756
01:07:01,014 --> 01:07:03,046
You want me to be the father?

757
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:07,577
I'd rather that than someone I don't know at all.

758
01:07:07,602 --> 01:07:08,796
He knows about it?

759
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:11,131
No.

760
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:15,897
Then why are you asking me to do this?
Because you like me?

761
01:07:17,483 --> 01:07:20,147
I can't ask you to do this if I don't like you.

762
01:07:20,506 --> 01:07:25,194
If you cared about me that much...
I wouldn't have to use the artificial conception method.

763
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:26,889
I can't.

764
01:07:27,030 --> 01:07:31,694
What's the difference?
Artificial conception is more hypocritical.

765
01:07:32,452 --> 01:07:36,186
I take this back.
Forget it.

766
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:38,530
You're a terrible person.
You seduced me.

767
01:07:39,038 --> 01:07:40,155
It's the same thing.

768
01:07:42,483 --> 01:07:43,546
I like you.

769
01:07:44,491 --> 01:07:45,249
I can't.

770
01:07:45,296 --> 01:07:46,147
Madam.

771
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:51,905
Your heart desires me.

772
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:00,435
Chieko.

773
01:08:32,601 --> 01:08:34,319
Hello?
Hey, it's me.

774
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:38,007
Okay, okay, yes.

775
01:08:40,288 --> 01:08:41,569
She heard us outside the door.

776
01:08:43,616 --> 01:08:45,351
I'll go and check on her.

777
01:09:24,388 --> 01:09:25,263
Sadao.

778
01:09:26,989 --> 01:09:30,630
Ma'am.
Please don't get mad at me.

779
01:09:30,755 --> 01:09:32,864
Ah, that's the only thing I can do

780
01:09:33,443 --> 01:09:36,599
This is the penalty I have to pay.

781
01:09:36,624 --> 01:09:38,388
I can't hold back.

782
01:09:38,521 --> 01:09:40,646
I don't want to hear about you anymore.

783
01:09:40,715 --> 01:09:42,786
Hold on.

784
01:09:45,611 --> 01:09:47,142
I'm sure she'll come to me.

785
01:09:57,169 --> 01:09:59,958
Ma'am.
I've been expecting you.

786
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,203
What can I do for you?

787
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:11,054
I wish you wouldn't play with Sadao so much.

788
01:10:12,633 --> 01:10:14,312
He is picking on me.

789
01:10:14,672 --> 01:10:16,804
I feel sorry for Sadao.

790
01:10:17,328 --> 01:10:19,477
He's being played by two people, you and his aunt.

791
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,094
You like Sadao too, don't you?

792
01:10:22,328 --> 01:10:23,758
I don't like him.

793
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:28,820
But you're so mean, so I'm so frustrated.

794
01:10:29,383 --> 01:10:32,789
But you know that we have no advantage in this game.

795
01:10:32,867 --> 01:10:33,695
Why?

796
01:10:34,195 --> 01:10:39,055
You know how attractive a married woman like your wife is to him.

797
01:10:40,149 --> 01:10:42,281
That makes me a challenge.

798
01:10:44,625 --> 01:10:49,359
It's true, I'm liking Sadao more and more.

799
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:52,633
But in the end, he's Mrs. Shiraki's.

800
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:56,195
No one can imitate that crazy way of loving him.

801
01:10:56,220 --> 01:11:00,617
You think so?
I think you're a more formidable foe than his aunt.

802
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:06,758
If his aunt is a raccoon dog, then you are a fox.

803
01:11:07,485 --> 01:11:09,719
A raccoon dog and a fox scare each other.

804
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:12,320
Don't be rude.

805
01:11:12,586 --> 01:11:15,891
I bet Sadao will be corrupted by you playing with him.

806
01:11:17,024 --> 01:11:19,399
If that happens, will you take responsibility?

807
01:11:23,016 --> 01:11:25,352
You can't take responsibility.
It's just a game.

808
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:30,453
I'd give up the world and my family for him.

809
01:11:30,656 --> 01:11:34,445
What a stupid.
I don't believe you.

810
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:41,438
What's the hell?
If you don't even like Sadao, why don't you stop meddling?

811
01:11:42,117 --> 01:11:46,586
Don't get so excited.
Your beautiful face is becoming more and more foxy.

812
01:11:52,398 --> 01:11:53,475
I'm home.

813
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:54,148
Welcome home.

814
01:11:56,156 --> 01:11:56,687
You have a visitor?

815
01:11:57,710 --> 01:11:59,788
Good evening. I'm sorry to disturb you.

816
01:12:01,710 --> 01:12:05,569
I'm asking you to do what I just said.

817
01:12:09,290 --> 01:12:09,805
Who?

818
01:12:11,266 --> 01:12:14,602
A relative of my mother's came from Kansai to say hello.

819
01:12:32,937 --> 01:12:35,796
Hello, is Ueda residence?

820
01:12:36,062 --> 01:12:37,155
Yes.

821
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:42,663
I'm Mr. Tsutsumi's deputy.
Has Chief Ueda left already?

822
01:12:43,515 --> 01:12:45,351
Yes, please wait a moment.

823
01:12:45,898 --> 01:12:48,952
I have a call from Executive Director Tsutsumi's secretary.

824
01:12:49,288 --> 01:12:50,835
From Tsustumi's secretary?

825
01:12:52,733 --> 01:12:54,616
This is Ueda.

826
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:56,843
Are you Manager Ueda?

827
01:12:58,062 --> 01:13:04,023
I'm not Tsutsumi's secretary.
My name is Shizuko Miyajima and I visited your house earlier.

828
01:13:04,421 --> 01:13:07,608
I have something to tell you about your wife.

829
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:08,632
What's that?

830
01:13:09,249 --> 01:13:11,554
Your wife is in love with someone.

831
01:13:12,741 --> 01:13:15,968
So, who's your business partner?

832
01:13:16,265 --> 01:13:17,077
What?

833
01:13:17,725 --> 01:13:19,694
He's my lover.

834
01:13:20,226 --> 01:13:23,413
He's the one who's going to get your wife.

835
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,460
I need your help.

836
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:49,931
What's wrong?
You've been quiet.

837
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:57,923
We've been married six months.
I'm sure you must be disgusted by the tastelessness of our life together.

838
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:07,732
I'm thinking about having a baby.

839
01:14:10,841 --> 01:14:13,693
I've finally made up my mind to have conception.

840
01:14:19,273 --> 01:14:20,492
Why aren't you happy about it?

841
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:22,984
why did you change your mind?

842
01:14:24,070 --> 01:14:29,203
I feel like having a baby would help you and me a little.

843
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:36,039
You're not having someone else's baby, are you?

844
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:40,362
What a horrible thing to say.

845
01:14:43,308 --> 01:14:49,846
If it's happened, tell me.
It's easier for me to know the truth, no matter what the truth is.

846
01:14:50,378 --> 01:14:53,448
If you're that suspicious, I don't have a place to stand.

847
01:14:54,425 --> 01:14:56,956
I can't stand anymore.

848
01:14:57,027 --> 01:14:58,487
I hate you.

849
01:14:59,425 --> 01:15:00,394
Chieko.

850
01:15:01,144 --> 01:15:02,237
You so mean.

851
01:15:03,214 --> 01:15:07,097
You've never done anything for me, and I've always been suspicious of you.

852
01:15:07,933 --> 01:15:09,417
I can't stand anymore.

853
01:15:09,870 --> 01:15:11,284
I'm leaving.

854
01:15:12,464 --> 01:15:13,066
Chieko.

855
01:15:20,393 --> 01:15:22,127
If it makes you happy, I'll leave.

856
01:15:23,862 --> 01:15:25,721
You're right, I didn't do anything.

857
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:28,745
I have no right to stop you.

858
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:39,683
Surgery... is that a big deal?

859
01:15:40,073 --> 01:15:41,441
No, no, no, it's very simple.

860
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,081
You made a good decision.

861
01:15:46,003 --> 01:15:49,862
Wouldn't you like to know whose the partner is?

862
01:15:51,081 --> 01:15:56,441
Ueda-san has strictly forbidden me to tell you, but I'd be happy to do so in secret.

863
01:15:56,466 --> 01:15:57,675
I don't want to know.

864
01:16:03,919 --> 01:16:04,684
Here.

865
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:13,169
come in.

866
01:16:20,475 --> 01:16:21,686
Go ahead.

867
01:16:22,694 --> 01:16:24,022
Is this a hospital?

868
01:16:24,047 --> 01:16:25,350
This is his home.

869
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:32,678
He is the head of the gynecology department at a general hospital.
He only sees patients he's close to.

870
01:16:32,996 --> 01:16:34,019
Wait here.

871
01:16:48,648 --> 01:16:50,030
You must be Chieko Ueda.

872
01:16:52,905 --> 01:16:53,374
come in.

873
01:17:02,506 --> 01:17:07,279
I heard from Mr. Terada.
Don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

874
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:09,991
Please take off your clothes and lie down there.

875
01:17:13,937 --> 01:17:17,140
I'd still like my husband to be present.

876
01:17:17,351 --> 01:17:17,937
Why?

877
01:17:18,773 --> 01:17:22,945
It's a sacred thing for us.
I think it would be better if he were present.

878
01:17:22,970 --> 01:17:25,062
That won't be necessary.
Go ahead.

879
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,136
Take it easy.

880
01:18:07,588 --> 01:18:09,268
Are you going to give me that injection?

881
01:18:09,424 --> 01:18:15,744
It'll be easier if you get some sleep, so just lie down.

882
01:18:59,647 --> 01:19:00,826
Stop it!

883
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:02,248
I don't want to do this today.

884
01:19:02,273 --> 01:19:04,022
But you don't have to worry about it.

885
01:19:04,670 --> 01:19:06,225
Hey!

886
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:07,850
I'm leaving.

887
01:19:08,061 --> 01:19:09,349
It's too late.

888
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:12,358
What's wrong with you?

889
01:19:16,236 --> 01:19:17,517
Wait.

890
01:19:18,470 --> 01:19:21,103
Hey madam!

891
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:27,367
I'm Ishikawa from the Research Division.

892
01:19:27,593 --> 01:19:31,140
This is Chieko.

893
01:19:32,917 --> 01:19:38,713
I feel very miserable and don't know what to do.
I really need to see you.

894
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:42,237
Please.
Help me.

895
01:19:44,674 --> 01:19:49,143
Oh no..
I'll see you at 4:00. I'm sure we can work something out.

896
01:19:49,919 --> 01:19:52,622
Okay, where should I meet you?

897
01:19:54,646 --> 01:19:57,146
Okay, sure.

898
01:19:58,571 --> 01:20:03,344
Just in case, please don't change your mind.

899
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:05,314
See you then.

900
01:20:14,517 --> 01:20:18,713
I have some urgent business at home.
I have to leave early at 3:30.

901
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:19,955
I see.

902
01:20:21,545 --> 01:20:26,108
Do you know Shizuko Mikoshima?

903
01:20:26,133 --> 01:20:28,163
My fiancée.

904
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:30,530
Your fiancée?

905
01:20:31,358 --> 01:20:32,413
Do you know her?

906
01:20:32,655 --> 01:20:37,124
Someone asked me to do a little favor for you the other day.

907
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,608
When are you getting married?

908
01:20:40,499 --> 01:20:41,709
Not yet.

909
01:20:41,905 --> 01:20:45,022
I'd like to ask the Chief and his wife to join us for dinner then.

910
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:48,092
I'd be delighted.

911
01:20:48,858 --> 01:20:50,303
I'll be happy to.

912
01:21:04,061 --> 01:21:04,842
Uno.

913
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:14,334
It's hard to say.
Actually, I was wondering if you could do me a favor.

914
01:21:14,905 --> 01:21:15,631
What is it?

915
01:21:38,871 --> 01:21:40,113
I got here at 4:00 exactly.

916
01:21:40,582 --> 01:21:41,230
Thank you.

917
01:21:41,934 --> 01:21:42,707
Is something wrong?

918
01:21:44,707 --> 01:21:48,996
Mr. Ishikawa, take me somewhere.

919
01:21:50,191 --> 01:21:51,840
This is a big change of your heart.

920
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:53,910
You don't worry about your husband?

921
01:21:53,935 --> 01:21:55,816
Please don't talk about my husband .

922
01:21:57,410 --> 01:22:00,066
I'm not meeting you behind my husband's back.

923
01:22:00,941 --> 01:22:05,004
I called you here to be true to myself.

924
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,644
I'll take responsibility for my actions.

925
01:22:09,238 --> 01:22:10,230
You look so unhappy.

926
01:22:11,051 --> 01:22:12,816
But I'm afraid you're going to run away again.

927
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,059
I won't.

928
01:22:17,723 --> 01:22:18,465
Never?

929
01:22:20,473 --> 01:22:20,934
Yeah.

930
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:27,057
Hello, I'm calling from the front desk of the Silvermont Hotel.

931
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:30,119
Mr. Ishikawa came into the hotel with a woman.

932
01:22:31,151 --> 01:22:35,057
Uh, yes, she's about 25 years old and looks like a young wife.

933
01:22:36,018 --> 01:22:38,018
Let's have a toast.
To great love.

934
01:22:46,447 --> 01:22:47,611
Did we look like a couple?

935
01:22:49,518 --> 01:22:51,705
I don't care what people think about me.

936
01:22:52,705 --> 01:22:54,018
I'm going my way.

937
01:22:54,119 --> 01:22:55,416
You're great.

938
01:22:56,994 --> 01:23:00,213
Mr. Ishikawa.
What do you think of Shizuko-san?

939
01:23:00,385 --> 01:23:02,096
I don't really care.

940
01:23:02,650 --> 01:23:06,439
You know, my Chief was asking me about Shizuko earlier, but I wonder if he met her.

941
01:23:06,814 --> 01:23:08,947
Please don't talk about my husband .

942
01:23:09,002 --> 01:23:10,002
Sorry.

943
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:12,447
How about Mitsuko?

944
01:23:12,658 --> 01:23:14,838
She's a whore.
She thinks she's so progressive.

945
01:23:15,525 --> 01:23:17,408
She's nice to play with, but...

946
01:23:18,158 --> 01:23:19,283
How about your aunt?

947
01:23:19,768 --> 01:23:21,978
With my aunt, for purely financial reasons.

948
01:23:22,846 --> 01:23:25,478
I don't like it.
It's as if you're being probed.

949
01:23:26,572 --> 01:23:30,494
Well, I'm young and single, so I've had played women.

950
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:34,275
But I like you the best.

951
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:37,971
The other women don't matter.

952
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:51,487
She's trembling.

953
01:23:52,823 --> 01:23:54,619
I've never had sex before.

954
01:23:55,705 --> 01:23:57,182
I don't know anything about it.

955
01:24:23,379 --> 01:24:24,012
Who?

956
01:24:31,655 --> 01:24:32,561
That's what I thought.

957
01:24:34,170 --> 01:24:35,694
Chieko!

958
01:24:41,796 --> 01:24:43,702
Ishikawa!

959
01:24:43,827 --> 01:24:45,952
I was just trying to weigh her down.

960
01:24:46,444 --> 01:24:47,600
I wish you could thank me for that.

961
01:24:47,632 --> 01:24:48,843
You idiot!

962
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:51,960
Stop it.

963
01:24:52,171 --> 01:24:55,171
This is my fault.

964
01:24:55,196 --> 01:24:59,741
It's true.
This is what happens when you can't give your wife the pleasure of a woman.

965
01:25:03,157 --> 01:25:05,789
It's not right to marry a man who can't have sex!

966
01:25:07,133 --> 01:25:08,329
You idiot!

967
01:25:09,657 --> 01:25:11,930
Stop it.

968
01:25:12,539 --> 01:25:14,180
Please leave.

969
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,860
Please, no violence.

970
01:25:17,702 --> 01:25:22,905
You guys are gonna have to talk this through.
I mean, it's an old-fashioned moral imperative.

971
01:25:23,124 --> 01:25:24,171
What?

972
01:25:38,941 --> 01:25:40,597
Let me go.

973
01:26:04,212 --> 01:26:05,774
Are you alright?

974
01:26:07,751 --> 01:26:10,907
You told that man about my body.

975
01:26:13,048 --> 01:26:16,540
You idiot!

976
01:26:18,485 --> 01:26:19,290
You idiot!

977
01:26:19,524 --> 01:26:21,407
Sorry...

978
01:26:21,938 --> 01:26:23,446
You idiot!

979
01:26:24,969 --> 01:26:25,891
You idiot!

980
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:27,907
You idiot!

981
01:26:28,454 --> 01:26:29,766
You idiot!

982
01:26:30,118 --> 01:26:31,071
You idiot!

983
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:33,219
You are such a terrible person.

984
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:37,875
Chieko!

985
01:27:31,102 --> 01:27:32,555
I'm getting better, aren't I?

986
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:38,516
The moment I heard you went into that hotel room, my period changed.

987
01:27:39,610 --> 01:27:42,383
Now we're really married.

988
01:27:46,260 --> 01:27:48,377
Forgive me?

989
01:27:49,026 --> 01:27:52,971
You don’t have to  forgive me.
It's all because of you.

990
01:28:09,937 --> 01:28:11,367
Are you sick?

991
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,500
I'm sorry to call you.

992
01:28:17,429 --> 01:28:20,328
I'm afraid I'm going out of my mind.

993
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:22,664
What's wrong?

994
01:28:24,742 --> 01:28:28,843
Michiko Sawaki got pregnant because of SADAO.

995
01:28:30,414 --> 01:28:35,210
Sadao pretended to be in love with Shizuko and you and met that woman every day.

996
01:28:36,156 --> 01:28:38,070
I am so frustrated.

997
01:28:41,117 --> 01:28:42,843
There's a phone call for Mrs. Ueda.

998
01:28:42,929 --> 01:28:44,296
From who?

999
01:28:44,476 --> 01:28:46,452
From Michiko Sawaki.

1000
01:28:46,477 --> 01:28:48,367
why does she call us?

1001
01:28:48,703 --> 01:28:50,507
Please take it.

1002
01:28:51,257 --> 01:28:54,460
please encourage her to have an abortion.

1003
01:28:56,421 --> 01:28:57,937
Hello, it's me, Chieko.

1004
01:28:58,718 --> 01:29:01,453
I heard.
You're in a lot of trouble.

1005
01:29:01,593 --> 01:29:03,171
I want to be a mom.

1006
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,898
Thanks to you, I have become an ordinary woman.

1007
01:29:05,923 --> 01:29:11,265
I don't care what kind of games you play, but having a baby is just too sloppy.

1008
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:14,359
I know Shiraki's there.
Tell her.

1009
01:29:14,867 --> 01:29:18,335
I can't have a baby but I won't get married him.

1010
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:22,070
Chieko can play with him too.

1011
01:29:22,437 --> 01:29:25,109
You are very irresponsible.

1012
01:29:25,406 --> 01:29:30,578
I don't care what you say
I'll have a baby and live without getting married for the rest of my life

1013
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:35,752
I want to live in a way no Japanese woman has ever lived before.

1014
01:29:36,713 --> 01:29:40,541
That's all I wanted to say to you.
Well, good-bye.

1015
01:29:50,985 --> 01:29:53,196
what did she say?

1016
01:29:54,189 --> 01:29:57,353
She's trying to be tough, but She is still lonely.

1017
01:29:57,853 --> 01:29:59,540
she said she was going to have a baby.

1018
01:29:59,665 --> 01:30:02,493
Don't you regret that she gave birth to Mr. Sadao's child?

1019
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:05,915
I'm just a bystander.

1020
01:30:06,337 --> 01:30:10,556
I just want to watch over her.

1021
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:12,993
You love Sadao, don't you?

1022
01:30:14,087 --> 01:30:18,603
For a time.
But there was no love.

1023
01:30:19,682 --> 01:30:22,839
Because... I have a husband I love.

1024
01:30:25,323 --> 01:30:27,472
But you were so close to him.

1025
01:30:28,362 --> 01:30:32,643
If that's all I can do, I'll leave you to it.
Take care.

1026
01:30:36,648 --> 01:30:38,547
You all make fun of me.

1027
01:30:41,461 --> 01:30:44,812
Can I have a glass of water, please?

1028
01:30:47,499 --> 01:30:54,272
I have this calm gait.
I'm already sitting on the throne of wife.

1029
01:30:55,844 --> 01:30:59,414
This peace of mind of an ordinary woman seeking happiness

1030
01:31:00,930 --> 01:31:03,351
It's been a nightmarish six months.

1031
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:25,390
THE END

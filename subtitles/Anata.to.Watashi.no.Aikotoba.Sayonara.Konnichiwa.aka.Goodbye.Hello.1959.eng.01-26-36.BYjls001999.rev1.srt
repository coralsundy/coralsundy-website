Anata to watashi no aikotoba: Sayonara, konnichiwa / Goodbye, Hello (1959)

3
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:44,059
I can't find

4
00:01:44,293 --> 00:01:45,759
Good weather

5
00:01:46,463 --> 00:01:48,536
I'm thinking of going hiking tomorrow

6
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:50,004
I'll give you sweets

7
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:52,088
I can't find

8
00:01:52,232 --> 00:01:52,919
Dog?

9
00:01:53,356 --> 00:01:53,863
Dog?

10
00:01:54,183 --> 00:01:55,876
Is he disappeared?

11
00:01:56,284 --> 00:01:58,224
Your dog is spits?

12
00:01:58,848 --> 00:01:59,408
White one?

13
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:03,128
I mean a girl, human

14
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:03,998
What?

15
00:02:04,178 --> 00:02:05,878
I can't find a partner

16
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:07,909
Would you like to go to the rooftop?

17
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,076
My mom told me to find a partner for me

18
00:02:17,285 --> 00:02:19,511
She worries about me

19
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,904
I want to fall in love with someone

20
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:22,621
You're serious

21
00:02:22,646 --> 00:02:28,388
The women we know are interested in us.

22
00:02:28,486 --> 00:02:29,406
You are vain

23
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:30,346
You sure?

24
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:30,979
Yes

25
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:35,576
Women get a job to find a marriage partner.

26
00:02:36,326 --> 00:02:42,358
The newspapers say there will be a shortage of women in 20 years.

27
00:02:42,383 --> 00:02:45,129
I don't care about the future

28
00:02:45,684 --> 00:02:48,417
I know you are playboy

29
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:50,547
I haven't find yet

30
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,757
She wear sleeveless.
She looks healthy

31
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:15,646
She's into me

32
00:03:15,713 --> 00:03:16,839
She's into me

33
00:03:19,718 --> 00:03:24,044
They say she is proud.

34
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:28,746
I like those kind of women

35
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:31,910
She has good education, I hear

36
00:03:31,984 --> 00:03:34,211
I don't think she is good for you

37
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,726
Have you asked her already?

38
00:03:35,954 --> 00:03:40,074
She looks girly and beautiful

39
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:41,611
She's polite

40
00:03:41,777 --> 00:03:42,497
No

41
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,443
I like her

42
00:03:44,477 --> 00:03:45,130
No

43
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:47,021
I am really into her

44
00:03:56,427 --> 00:03:57,174
Hello?

45
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:02,013
It's lunch break.
Aota?

46
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,912
Aota? there's a call for you

47
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,674
Thank you

48
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,530
Hello?

49
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:16,780
Oh Umeko, What's wrong?

50
00:04:17,335 --> 00:04:22,548
How are you?
Are you calling from Tokyo station?

51
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:27,366
I don't go out much

52
00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:31,335
It's been a year

53
00:04:32,417 --> 00:04:35,563
Yeah, it was summer

54
00:04:35,793 --> 00:04:40,700
Would you like to come to the cemetery

55
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,262
Work? What kind?

56
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,191
I can go out.
Where?

57
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:50,816
I get it

58
00:04:52,082 --> 00:04:55,981
I'll be there in 20mins

59
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:06,749
Welcome

60
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:10,359
I'm here

61
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:19,023
What do you order?

62
00:05:19,867 --> 00:05:24,679
The restaurant here used to be good, but now it's bad.

63
00:05:25,374 --> 00:05:26,078
Ice Cream

64
00:05:26,249 --> 00:05:30,367
Even in this cold weather
You eat ice cream the American way, even in winter.

65
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:33,312
But it's not good for your health

66
00:05:36,229 --> 00:05:40,276
I know you're not a bad person.
But don't laugh like that.

67
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,502
You're laughing like you despise people.

68
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:43,080
Really?

69
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,744
yeah, come

70
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:50,799
Don't waste time! There's a new specialty restaurant in a department store in Nihonbashi.
Ice cream!

71
00:05:51,065 --> 00:05:56,174
I started working at that branch.
I advance to Tokyo

72
00:05:56,307 --> 00:05:57,018
You'll be busy

73
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,838
So please let me stay a few days

74
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,526
I know

75
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:00,151
Thanks

76
00:06:01,182 --> 00:06:01,916
Are you busy?

77
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:03,682
Worries?

78
00:06:04,369 --> 00:06:06,823
You can talk to me about anything.
What is it?

79
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:08,924
It's a little complicated.

80
00:06:09,393 --> 00:06:14,244
So ask me at the night.
I'm busy

81
00:06:14,596 --> 00:06:15,096
OK

82
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:21,221
If my business succeeds, I will be very busy.

83
00:06:21,393 --> 00:06:22,565
You're not getting married?

84
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:27,729
A woman who marries is a woman who cannot work.
If you get married, God will weep.

85
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:31,268
Did you receive an invitation to marry?

86
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:36,666
That's good.
I'm getting more and more tired of these men I'm observing.

87
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:41,408
Men lose their individuality and look like stingy pigs

88
00:06:41,752 --> 00:06:42,346
Right?

89
00:06:42,588 --> 00:06:44,416
It could be

90
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,635
are there any exceptions?

91
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:46,393
I have no idea

92
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:47,151
Why?

93
00:06:47,252 --> 00:06:49,580
I don't observe things with the same interest that you do.

94
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:54,143
That you ignore men at all?

95
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:59,276
since when do you wear glasses?

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,143
Always

97
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,518
You are lying

98
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:02,698
I changed the flame

99
00:07:03,026 --> 00:07:06,659
You didn't wear glasses the last time we met.

100
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:08,494
I'll take it off

101
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:11,627
It's better.
are you nearsighted?

102
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:14,588
You look beautiful in a daze.

103
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:16,299
you really nearsighted?

104
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:18,026
You told me you were busy

105
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:20,487
I forgot it

106
00:08:34,424 --> 00:08:35,385
You surprised me

107
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,799
I didn't know you backed home

108
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,260
I left the company early

109
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:42,440
What's wrong?

110
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:48,377
I told you to go to the dentist.

111
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:50,159
It's okay. It's cooled off.

112
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:51,541
Where's dad?

113
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:52,096
Not here

114
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:54,955
You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

115
00:08:55,073 --> 00:08:57,291
I had soft foods

116
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:58,221
Who cocked for you?

117
00:08:58,252 --> 00:08:58,963
Tecchan

118
00:08:59,198 --> 00:08:59,854
Tecchan?

119
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,573
I ate porridge

120
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:03,909
porridge?
You cocked?

121
00:09:03,956 --> 00:09:04,799
Tecchan

122
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:05,846
Tecchan?

123
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,416
I think he was cooking your dinner too.

124
00:09:09,862 --> 00:09:11,760
Oh I feel sorry

125
00:09:11,838 --> 00:09:13,182
He can cook good

126
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,104
he had dinner too?

127
00:09:16,862 --> 00:09:17,659
Who?

128
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:18,752
I think Umeko

129
00:09:18,909 --> 00:09:19,870
is she coming?

130
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,479
I hate talkative girls

131
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,260
Be careful

132
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,515
I just got home

133
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,234
Tokyo is busy.
I feel calm when I come here

134
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:30,461
because I take care of you

135
00:09:30,531 --> 00:09:33,133
Yeah it's free.
Oh Toothache?

136
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,430
Welcome

137
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,664
Good evening.

138
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:39,023
You must be in a lot of pain.

139
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:40,515
It's a big problem

140
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:44,328
Are you used to it yet? Airplanes?

141
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:49,351
I definitely don't want a job like a flight attendant

142
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,844
I hope the plane you boarded doesn't crash

143
00:09:51,869 --> 00:09:52,695
Don't worry

144
00:09:52,867 --> 00:09:54,836
I worry about her

145
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,226
You worry too much

146
00:09:57,265 --> 00:09:58,961
She works for your mom

147
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,867
I'm on a plane so feel my feelings

148
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:04,648
I don't want you to die

149
00:10:04,673 --> 00:10:05,586
You are good sister

150
00:10:05,749 --> 00:10:09,632
I can't take care of your father like you can.

151
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,359
You can't manage yourself either

152
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:16,148
How is your father?

153
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:20,398
He goes to work every day.
I know He doesn't have a job, but...

154
00:10:20,484 --> 00:10:21,398
he is a boatman

155
00:10:21,765 --> 00:10:22,703
Yeah

156
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:24,750
The shipping companies are in a recession.

157
00:10:24,781 --> 00:10:26,047
There are too many boatman

158
00:10:26,219 --> 00:10:27,625
I'm hungry

159
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,445
I bought Sushi at department store

160
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:35,937
Bring us some tea.

161
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:43,609
What's your advice?

162
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,273
I'm not sure how serious it is.

163
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:48,937
More serious

164
00:10:49,102 --> 00:10:50,391
Where's tea bag?

165
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:53,273
It's in a yellow can in the cupboard

166
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,430
Oh I found it

167
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,195
Money?

168
00:10:58,609 --> 00:11:00,547
There's someone I'd like you to meet.

169
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,672
Who? man?

170
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:03,437
Woman?

171
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,109
A man.
He's in Osaka

172
00:11:07,086 --> 00:11:09,375
Young Man in Osaka?

173
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,039
I tell you later

174
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:11,945
About Watanabe?

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,953
What the hell?
Go to sleep.

176
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,055
You don't have to fake it.

177
00:11:18,164 --> 00:11:19,547
What's wrong with Hanjiro?

178
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:21,500
It's none of your business

179
00:11:21,562 --> 00:11:23,342
Wanna eat Sushi?
Can you eat?

180
00:11:23,367 --> 00:11:24,727
Thanks

181
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,781
Your teeth OK?

182
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:29,242
Watanabe is my sister's boyfriend

183
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:30,820
He's not

184
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,109
he may be a fiancee

185
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:34,406
he may be a fiancee?

186
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:39,133
Dad is back

187
00:11:44,031 --> 00:11:46,922
The door is broken

188
00:11:55,002 --> 00:11:57,776
It is unusual for him to be drunk

189
00:11:58,573 --> 00:12:01,799
I fixed it but The door is broken again

190
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,112
It's not broken

191
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:09,166
I didn't know you were home.
Give me some water

192
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:11,416
I have tooth ache

193
00:12:17,657 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm alright

194
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:23,188
Oh no

195
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:29,985
I didn't know you had a fiancee

196
00:12:30,126 --> 00:12:31,931
He's not

197
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:34,056
So I need your advice

198
00:12:35,727 --> 00:12:36,962
Did you had dinner yet?

199
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,056
I don't wanna eat

200
00:12:39,681 --> 00:12:42,587
It is unusual for him to be drunk

201
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,141
Let's take him upstairs and let him sleep

202
00:12:46,712 --> 00:12:49,556
I don't wanna sleep yet

203
00:12:51,118 --> 00:12:52,751
Tsuru is still here?

204
00:12:52,776 --> 00:12:53,923
She's in upstairs

205
00:12:53,948 --> 00:12:54,704
Water

206
00:12:55,298 --> 00:12:56,759
Shall I bring a towel?

207
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,595
Oh welcome

208
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,634
Good evening

209
00:13:05,267 --> 00:13:06,282
How's Osaka?

210
00:13:06,595 --> 00:13:08,587
I'm in Tokyo for work

211
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:13,634
Tokyo is getting worse

212
00:13:15,376 --> 00:13:16,587
Your Water

213
00:13:17,571 --> 00:13:20,563
Bring me a Sake

214
00:13:20,618 --> 00:13:22,462
Just a little bit of whiskey left

215
00:13:23,282 --> 00:13:24,720
You are already drunker

216
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,673
I resigned company

217
00:13:34,615 --> 00:13:35,576
What happened?

218
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:39,857
Not that it's any of my business.

219
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:44,591
There are too many problem

220
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:49,053
Even executives are getting stingy

221
00:13:50,053 --> 00:13:54,842
they are only trying to defend their position

222
00:13:55,959 --> 00:13:59,560
So employees feel the same way.

223
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:01,990
So I quit

224
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:07,013
I'll work as boatman again

225
00:14:07,607 --> 00:14:08,701
Someone asked you the job?

226
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:14,904
If I want to work, some people have worked with me.

227
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,585
I'm sure you'll find it if you really look for it.

228
00:14:21,522 --> 00:14:24,507
You really quit your job?

229
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,952
Definitely

230
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:33,843
It can't be helped.
brought whiskey.

231
00:14:36,538 --> 00:14:41,460
It's hard to have to sit at a desk when there's nothing

232
00:14:42,476 --> 00:14:44,913
Being an office worker doesn't suit me

233
00:14:45,796 --> 00:14:47,820
I know it's selfish of me.

234
00:14:48,906 --> 00:14:52,179
I put up with it for nine years.

235
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:56,327
I thought about it, too.

236
00:14:57,264 --> 00:15:03,991
I felt sorry for them if I quit the company now, having two daughters before they were married.

237
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:06,124
Forget it

238
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,499
I can't

239
00:15:08,156 --> 00:15:10,335
That's the heart of a parent, isn't it?

240
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:12,038
Right,Umeko?

241
00:15:14,171 --> 00:15:20,601
And they doesn't have a mother.
I'm afraid I'll be responsible for them if I don't get them married soon.

242
00:15:22,351 --> 00:15:28,023
She's a straight shooter.
I ask her to marry me and she says yes.

243
00:15:31,042 --> 00:15:32,292
Right?

244
00:15:33,034 --> 00:15:33,534
Yes

245
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:34,510
Good

246
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,432
Good evening

247
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:40,393
I will go

248
00:15:43,503 --> 00:15:44,206
Who?

249
00:15:44,386 --> 00:15:45,683
It seems Tecchan

250
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:51,839
Good evening.
Is there anything I can do for you?

251
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,300
Who are you?

252
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:54,893
Me?

253
00:15:55,393 --> 00:15:56,792
I'm dry cleaner.

254
00:15:57,042 --> 00:16:01,456
The dry cleaner who comes at night is strange.
Come tomorrow

255
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:03,881
He was dry cleaner.

256
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,084
Oh I wanted to ask him to buy some bread

257
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:09,998
One bread, and more?

258
00:16:10,123 --> 00:16:12,920
Oh Tecchan, that's all

259
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:13,998
Thanks

260
00:16:14,381 --> 00:16:16,014
OK see you

261
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,412
He is a night college student.
During the day he works in the cleaning

262
00:16:22,787 --> 00:16:24,459
Give me water

263
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:26,803
He's still saying

264
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:33,541
He's lonely

265
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:03,623
She had a beautiful voice.
She was always singing hymns.

266
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,099
You never get tired of saying the same thing.

267
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:08,271
I've been saying it since I was a sophomore in college.

268
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,326
It's been 10 yrs?

269
00:17:09,351 --> 00:17:12,185
Eight years this year.
You were a sophomore in high school.

270
00:17:12,841 --> 00:17:15,295
Poor thing, dying at such a young age.

271
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:19,756
I'm sleepy

272
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,107
I'm sorry for last night

273
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:26,959
It's OK

274
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,380
when did he go to bed last night?

275
00:17:30,427 --> 00:17:31,146
3: 30

276
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:35,802
don't you worry about his job?

277
00:17:35,881 --> 00:17:39,927
Household finances?
I don't know. I guess it depends on my father's situation.

278
00:17:40,302 --> 00:17:42,841
If it comes to it, TSURU and I will take care of it.

279
00:17:42,866 --> 00:17:44,185
That's tough.

280
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,529
Let's hear your story.

281
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:51,951
Why wouldn't she be interested in a man?
You have a fiancee

282
00:17:51,976 --> 00:17:54,099
It's none of your business

283
00:18:01,232 --> 00:18:04,318
He's the son of a friend of my father's, someone I've known since I was a kid.

284
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,724
His father died five years ago.

285
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:10,232
but his parents had plans for us

286
00:18:10,365 --> 00:18:15,045
they were trying to get you married?

287
00:18:15,154 --> 00:18:17,114
I don't know if it's that clear or not.

288
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:18,818
I'm stunned.

289
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,326
you'd better ignore

290
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:22,224
Lately he's been rushing me so much

291
00:18:22,873 --> 00:18:24,490
He's name is Tibetan?

292
00:18:24,669 --> 00:18:25,473
Hanjiro

293
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:28,209
did he say he wants to marry you soon?

294
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,490
his mother seems to be

295
00:18:30,515 --> 00:18:31,076
He didn't say?

296
00:18:31,177 --> 00:18:32,013
I have no idea

297
00:18:32,201 --> 00:18:34,623
It said, my mother is in a hurry.

298
00:18:34,732 --> 00:18:36,076
He's a man who doesn't make himself clear.

299
00:18:36,326 --> 00:18:38,607
he is an ordinary office worker

300
00:18:38,849 --> 00:18:43,435
Ordinary office workers can propose

301
00:18:43,615 --> 00:18:45,131
I have never been told that by him

302
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,365
You'd better decline

303
00:18:46,435 --> 00:18:48,013
So I'm asking you

304
00:18:48,185 --> 00:18:48,951
decline?

305
00:18:49,248 --> 00:18:49,896
Yeah

306
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:53,052
Good.
That's so you

307
00:18:53,576 --> 00:18:56,271
It's not big deal

308
00:18:56,966 --> 00:19:01,748
It's not as big a deal as breaking off an engagement.
It's not that I don't like Mr. Hanjirou.

309
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:07,388
It's just annoying.
They tells me when I'm not thinking about marriage.

310
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,984
So I thought maybe I could write it down on a piece of paper, but it's too hard to do that.

311
00:19:13,048 --> 00:19:17,406
You want me to meet with him in person and describe your current state of mind?

312
00:19:17,633 --> 00:19:19,734
I'm not very good at writing essays.

313
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:23,281
Okay,
Don't worry, I tell him to decline it

314
00:19:24,544 --> 00:19:25,818
Don't worry

315
00:19:42,726 --> 00:19:45,117
Here's a quote from the Wakayama Agricultural Cooperative.

316
00:19:46,617 --> 00:19:47,703
Thanks

317
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,867
What happened to that story?

318
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:55,312
What?

319
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,265
transferring to Tokyo.

320
00:19:57,492 --> 00:19:59,156
Oh yeah

321
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:01,992
I told it to head office

322
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,617
I heard new employees are coming to Osaka.

323
00:20:05,054 --> 00:20:07,961
One in Accounting.
And one more in my place?

324
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:09,586
I have no idea

325
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:12,468
My mother wants to go back to Tokyo

326
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:16,929
she wanted to die in her hometown

327
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:19,046
is your mother sick?

328
00:20:20,031 --> 00:20:21,461
She's fine

329
00:20:24,028 --> 00:20:29,340
I think you'll get a lot of benefits if you stay at the head office.

330
00:20:29,723 --> 00:20:31,684
How many years have you been in Osaka?

331
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:32,739
4 yrs

332
00:20:34,176 --> 00:20:35,708
You don't like Osaka women?

333
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,481
I’m not talking about women

334
00:20:37,575 --> 00:20:39,106
You have a guest

335
00:20:39,262 --> 00:20:40,239
Me?

336
00:20:47,286 --> 00:20:48,373
He?

337
00:20:49,002 --> 00:20:51,068
I'm sorry to bother you.

338
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:55,022
Are you Hanjiro Watanabe?

339
00:20:55,819 --> 00:20:56,186
Yes

340
00:20:57,292 --> 00:21:02,405
Are you Hanjiro Watanabe, who worked at the head office in Tokyo for three years and at the Osaka branch office for four years?

341
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:10,417
I see,The clerk told me there were three Mr. Watanabe here.
I didn't want to make a mistake.

342
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:14,070
Nice to meet you. I'm ICHIGE.

343
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,112
Actually,  Kazuko asked me to come here.

344
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:19,202
Kazuko from Tokyo

345
00:21:19,492 --> 00:21:21,766
I need to talk to you for a minute.

346
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:23,334
Please wait here

347
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:29,125
Is meeting room available?

348
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,325
They are available until 3:30

349
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:40,020
I would have come earlier, but I was busy with work. I'm sorry I'm late.

350
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:43,979
I am three years your senior at the same school as Kazuko-San.

351
00:21:44,298 --> 00:21:48,132
There was a girl named Koizumi Mori in your class, too, who died of a heart ailment.

352
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,190
When I was sad, Kazuko-san comforted me.

353
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:56,498
Since then, I have been in a relationship with Ms. Kazuko as if we were Sisters.

354
00:21:57,097 --> 00:22:01,797
I thought women didn't need to study.

355
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:06,002
I was in my third year of college.
I dropped out.

356
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:09,187
Everyone stopped me because it's only a year away.

357
00:22:09,312 --> 00:22:10,425
What do you want?

358
00:22:10,904 --> 00:22:14,730
And as I said before...
Kazuko-san and I are like family.

359
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,934
I understand how Kazuko-san feels.

360
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:20,577
I understand her relationship with you.

361
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:21,697
What do you want?

362
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:26,189
I'm sure we'll take the time to talk about these things.

363
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:32,652
For Kazuko, it's not that she doesn't like you anymore.
It's not that she doesn't like you or that she has found someone else.

364
00:22:33,579 --> 00:22:40,213
I want you to cancel the marriage. I'm just saying that if you honestly and genuinely tell her how you feel...
That's all I'm saying.

365
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:41,184
Hold on

366
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:46,741
Have you been tasked by her to dissolve our marriage?

367
00:22:47,085 --> 00:22:48,545
Shortly,Yes

368
00:22:48,984 --> 00:22:50,591
KAzuko said so?

369
00:22:50,821 --> 00:22:54,861
Of course.
I wouldn't say anything that she doesn't say.

370
00:22:55,183 --> 00:22:56,023
I see.

371
00:22:56,833 --> 00:23:00,386
You men seem to think all women want to get married.

372
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,707
Not every woman with a job.

373
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:05,924
Kazuko-san's work is just getting interesting.

374
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:06,891
I see.

375
00:23:07,183 --> 00:23:08,803
I hope you understand that.

376
00:23:09,016 --> 00:23:09,610
I understand.

377
00:23:09,869 --> 00:23:11,609
I see. Thank you.

378
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,631
It means I understand what you're saying.

379
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:17,929
There's something you don't understand?

380
00:23:19,205 --> 00:23:23,665
I'm really close to Kazuko-san.
I'm sure I can answer anything.

381
00:23:23,844 --> 00:23:26,004
It's ok.
I understand.

382
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,999
I'm glad you understand

383
00:23:31,025 --> 00:23:36,251
It's a magnificent room.
It gets a lot of sun.

384
00:23:36,562 --> 00:23:39,068
It's not mine, so there's no need to flatter me.

385
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:53,306
Something is strange

386
00:23:54,735 --> 00:24:02,685
In short, Miyako's Mom bring Miyako here and get married?

387
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:03,715
Yes

388
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:08,830
It means we are brother but not brother

389
00:24:08,855 --> 00:24:09,987
What's that?

390
00:24:10,164 --> 00:24:12,165
You and I are not blood related.

391
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:12,833
Oh yeah

392
00:24:12,965 --> 00:24:18,497
You are eligible for that candidacy.

393
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:20,006
What do you mean?

394
00:24:20,086 --> 00:24:21,966
You are my rival

395
00:24:22,183 --> 00:24:24,009
I'm much better than you

396
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,323
What do you mean?

397
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:30,319
Hold on

398
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,870
Thanks for your work

399
00:24:32,895 --> 00:24:33,862
Good evening

400
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,073
You look good today

401
00:24:36,098 --> 00:24:38,412
Do you think so?

402
00:24:38,567 --> 00:24:39,540
Thanks

403
00:24:39,606 --> 00:24:41,853
Please take care of our customers

404
00:24:41,926 --> 00:24:43,786
You have to serve your customers

405
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:47,912
I was visiting some company.
I'm tried

406
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:52,808
You work so hard

407
00:24:53,649 --> 00:24:56,269
You're still here

408
00:24:56,599 --> 00:24:57,686
Thanks

409
00:24:58,363 --> 00:25:01,597
I hear you advance to Department store in Tokyo

410
00:25:01,622 --> 00:25:02,649
Yes I'm working on it

411
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,635
I'm against at her.
It's better to do business only locally.

412
00:25:07,234 --> 00:25:10,094
It's much better to advance in Tokyo

413
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:11,842
Our customers are waiting

414
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:14,009
Ok see you then

415
00:25:18,198 --> 00:25:20,231
I don't like him

416
00:25:20,391 --> 00:25:21,838
It can't be helped

417
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:26,793
Our business is going well

418
00:25:27,324 --> 00:25:29,337
It is good woman goes to university

419
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:30,043
I dropped out

420
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:31,683
Did you manage the Kazuko's problem?

421
00:25:32,067 --> 00:25:37,060
He is a serious and solid man, just as KAZUKO said he would be.

422
00:25:37,121 --> 00:25:40,454
So Why you declined?

423
00:25:41,007 --> 00:25:44,087
Women doesn't know anything

424
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:49,094
You declined many matchmaking

425
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:54,074
Are you guys in an anti-marriage alliance?

426
00:25:54,154 --> 00:25:55,541
Don't say bullshit

427
00:25:56,157 --> 00:26:00,071
It's about being a wimp.

428
00:26:00,598 --> 00:26:03,178
We just can't trust each other with the other.

429
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:05,133
It's a heart-to-heart.

430
00:26:05,253 --> 00:26:07,279
I don't like women's world

431
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,049
Give me a towel

432
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:23,047
You had a hearing problem when you were little, so I assume you misheard.

433
00:26:23,189 --> 00:26:23,722
Ear?

434
00:26:24,353 --> 00:26:30,648
I think what you heard from that woman is ridiculous.

435
00:26:30,832 --> 00:26:32,285
She didn't want to meet me in person

436
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:34,338
How did you reply her?

437
00:26:34,548 --> 00:26:36,055
I told her I understood

438
00:26:36,306 --> 00:26:38,419
That's bad

439
00:26:38,592 --> 00:26:40,525
It can't be helped

440
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,020
You wrote a letter to her,right?

441
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,813
Write again

442
00:26:44,621 --> 00:26:46,087
I'm not good at writing

443
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,293
I'll write for you

444
00:26:47,478 --> 00:26:49,358
Don't make it complicated

445
00:26:49,418 --> 00:26:50,164
Why?

446
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,745
I wish I could transferred to Tokyo

447
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:56,871
He's unreliable.

448
00:26:57,124 --> 00:26:57,864
Your boss?

449
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,434
I'll ask human resource chief

450
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:23,562
I feel good

451
00:27:23,897 --> 00:27:24,643
Yeah

452
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,170
10 mins to Haneda?

453
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:29,860
I'll be there on time

454
00:27:29,885 --> 00:27:30,544
Yeah

455
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:33,990
You love me?

456
00:27:34,121 --> 00:27:35,194
Yeah

457
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:38,858
What did you say?

458
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,179
Didn't catch me?

459
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,159
I couldn’t

460
00:27:42,969 --> 00:27:46,215
I kicked out my fiancee.
Are you happy?

461
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:47,468
I get it

462
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,101
Don't make fun of me

463
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:52,427
Don't talk to me so much.I'm driving

464
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:55,791
I don't mind I die with you

465
00:27:55,816 --> 00:27:57,675
You'll be on time

466
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,245
Didn't catch me?

467
00:27:59,354 --> 00:28:00,800

468
00:28:13,221 --> 00:28:14,628

That's not good

478
00:28:42,656 --> 00:28:44,912

Who told you?

From Hayakawa.
You'd be smart to quit your job early.

492
00:29:21,897 --> 00:29:23,295
You look better

493
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:25,272
It could be

494
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:29,436

495
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,358

504
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:06,139
A business card with his educational background is inside.

505
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:11,108
He's 30 yrs old, so good for your oldest daughter

506
00:30:12,928 --> 00:30:15,014
Give her

507
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:22,292
I'll call you soon.
I don't mean this.

508
00:30:51,177 --> 00:30:52,255
Good evening

509
00:30:53,334 --> 00:30:54,287
Tecchan?

510
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:09,331
Here it is

511
00:31:09,356 --> 00:31:09,730
Thanks

512
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:10,745
It was 65 yen

513
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,753
Thanks.
I was out of home

514
00:31:15,886 --> 00:31:18,378
Your laundry here.
Can you give me today's?

515
00:31:18,862 --> 00:31:20,370
I gave it to you this morning

516
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,261
Come in.
I'll serve you a tea

517
00:31:25,286 --> 00:31:27,120
I'll make the tea

518
00:31:41,675 --> 00:31:44,394
You're used to this house

519
00:31:44,419 --> 00:31:46,370
Shall I cook dinner?

520
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,869
I bought something at store

521
00:31:49,253 --> 00:31:54,112
but this is not very tasty

522
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:56,730
They are late

523
00:31:57,995 --> 00:32:02,838
Thank you for taking Michiko to the airport this morning.

524
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:04,683
Was she on time?

525
00:32:04,847 --> 00:32:05,440
Yes

526
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:12,430
what do you think when you see this picture?

527
00:32:12,883 --> 00:32:15,954
He looks good.
He's good for Michiko

528
00:32:16,493 --> 00:32:17,469
For Kazuko

529
00:32:18,165 --> 00:32:18,922
For Kazuko?

530
00:32:21,418 --> 00:32:23,918
I don't think this person is suitable for Kazuko.

531
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:24,879
You think so?

532
00:32:25,386 --> 00:32:27,527
Is he her fiancee?

533
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,277
He's not?

534
00:32:30,269 --> 00:32:31,207
He's not?

535
00:32:37,371 --> 00:32:38,184
Kazuko?

536
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:43,801
I'm home

537
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:01,450
I'll do

538
00:33:01,475 --> 00:33:02,639
I'll cook for you

539
00:33:14,336 --> 00:33:16,438
I cut my finger

540
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:17,664
Where

541
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:18,680
A lot?

542
00:33:20,258 --> 00:33:21,180
I'm bleeding.

543
00:33:22,414 --> 00:33:24,859
I will prepare the meal

544
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,297
I'm into cooking

545
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:29,375
You can't cook every day

546
00:33:29,563 --> 00:33:34,570
Don't worry.
You are busy

547
00:33:34,641 --> 00:33:37,602
I will prepare the meal.
I have always cooked

548
00:33:38,024 --> 00:33:39,570
You are stubborn

549
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:41,758
Oh you are here

550
00:33:42,227 --> 00:33:44,328
I have to go for school

551
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,813
Are you ok?

552
00:33:48,196 --> 00:33:50,547
It's ok,Tecchan

553
00:33:51,204 --> 00:33:52,750
Bring me the photo

554
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,790
That photo?

555
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,221
Look at this

556
00:34:03,783 --> 00:34:04,455
What's this?

557
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:05,838
Dating photos

558
00:34:06,664 --> 00:34:07,953
I got it for you

559
00:34:08,508 --> 00:34:09,313
No thanks

560
00:34:09,563 --> 00:34:10,149
Why?

561
00:34:10,375 --> 00:34:12,289
I'm not into it

562
00:34:13,078 --> 00:34:15,086
They worry about you

563
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:17,024
So they gave me

564
00:34:17,172 --> 00:34:20,117
I know he's your friend.
he is a meddlesome

565
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:21,391
Look at the photo

566
00:34:21,774 --> 00:34:22,360
No

567
00:34:24,266 --> 00:34:24,883
Kazuko

568
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,821
Have a seat

569
00:34:32,885 --> 00:34:34,213
you are stubborn

570
00:34:35,744 --> 00:34:38,580
Why you declined about Hanjiro's propose?

571
00:34:39,541 --> 00:34:43,760
I didn't know until this morning when I saw the letter from his mother.

572
00:34:44,392 --> 00:34:46,627
I was so surprised and appalled.

573
00:34:49,051 --> 00:34:52,567
Why didn't you ask me for a word of advice?

574
00:34:52,895 --> 00:34:53,973
I was thinking a lot too

575
00:34:54,348 --> 00:34:55,668
You don't have to

576
00:34:56,293 --> 00:34:57,996
He's good man

577
00:34:58,762 --> 00:35:00,809
He's good man for sure

578
00:35:02,301 --> 00:35:04,567
I don't want you to worry about me.

579
00:35:05,051 --> 00:35:07,543
I don't mean to worry you.

580
00:35:08,348 --> 00:35:09,371
OK

581
00:35:10,403 --> 00:35:13,051
You're just trying to be sensible.

582
00:35:13,715 --> 00:35:15,043
I won't say anything.

583
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:18,043
I'm going to OSAKA in a few days

584
00:35:18,653 --> 00:35:23,559
He looks better than Mr. Hanjiro

585
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,185
That's not why we're going.
I'm going on a business trip to the factory in Osaka.

586
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,732
I'm going to Osaka too
I'm going to take the entrance exam.

587
00:35:31,779 --> 00:35:33,075
I hope we are same train

588
00:35:33,333 --> 00:35:34,333
You are still here

589
00:35:34,552 --> 00:35:35,466
You will be late for school

590
00:35:35,864 --> 00:35:37,083
Damn it

591
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,890
See you

592
00:35:42,539 --> 00:35:48,132
I would have cooked for him.

593
00:35:48,157 --> 00:35:49,062
I see

594
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:53,132
I have no choice but to have you cook for me today.

595
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,648
you are stubborn too

596
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:43,312
We were on same train

597
00:36:57,409 --> 00:37:00,415
This car is now completely domestically produced

598
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:01,628
How's this design?

599
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:02,725
Looks good

600
00:37:02,878 --> 00:37:05,498
I think the engine is good.

601
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,964
When are you going back to Tokyo?

602
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:10,902
I'm going back now.
The door is better

603
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:25,704
A guest called Aota is here

604
00:37:26,228 --> 00:37:27,827
KAzuko? Where?

605
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:29,052
At the entrance

606
00:37:31,504 --> 00:37:32,490
Excuse me

607
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,692
I would have picked up with you

608
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:41,327
Hello?

609
00:37:41,381 --> 00:37:42,141
Welcome

610
00:37:42,309 --> 00:37:43,242
Come in

611
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,613
It was urgent busyness

612
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:46,650
Where's your bag?

613
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:47,737
I left it at the station

614
00:37:48,201 --> 00:37:49,087
Are you going back tomorrow?

615
00:37:49,234 --> 00:37:50,101
Let me stay here

616
00:37:50,211 --> 00:37:51,591
You can stay anytime

617
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:54,295
You are so busy

618
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:57,483
I came here 2 days ago, I stayed at company’s dormitory

619
00:37:57,638 --> 00:38:00,244
You are very troublesome.
That's why I hate Tokyo people

620
00:38:00,566 --> 00:38:02,972
People in Tokyo are cold even if you befriend them.

621
00:38:03,076 --> 00:38:05,603
I work late, I'm so busy

622
00:38:05,762 --> 00:38:07,455
You could called me at least

623
00:38:07,482 --> 00:38:08,409
Sorry

624
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:16,062
I wanna talk with you many things

625
00:38:16,276 --> 00:38:17,322
About Hanjiro?

626
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:19,134
It's cold today

627
00:38:30,829 --> 00:38:34,049
I was too busy so I couldn't write you

628
00:38:38,496 --> 00:38:40,096
Have you met him?

629
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:40,956
No

630
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:50,118
I told him how you felt.

631
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:53,463
He said he understood right away.

632
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,295
Thank you very much.

633
00:38:58,277 --> 00:38:59,917
So I don't need to meet him

634
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,807
My dad got letter

635
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,814
From hanjiro?

636
00:39:03,898 --> 00:39:05,765
From my mom, she got angry with me

637
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,161
I should probably go apologize to him

638
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:13,347
But I don't have anything to go to, so I'm feeling kind of weird.

639
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,183
So I won't meet him

640
00:39:15,336 --> 00:39:16,383
From Hanjiro, you got letter?

641
00:39:16,634 --> 00:39:18,174
He didn't send me anything

642
00:39:18,951 --> 00:39:20,291
He's so simple

643
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:23,755
we are not so close

644
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,207
I'm relieved to hear you say that.

645
00:39:27,937 --> 00:39:29,384
Do you mind if I love?

646
00:39:29,604 --> 00:39:30,137
Who?

647
00:39:30,464 --> 00:39:31,097
Hanjiro

648
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,700
Funny?

649
00:39:50,895 --> 00:39:52,622
I think so

650
00:39:52,647 --> 00:39:53,709
You scared me.

651
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:55,652
Shall I give you him?

652
00:39:55,956 --> 00:39:57,396
To me? Why?

653
00:39:57,634 --> 00:40:02,434
Are you sure?
So I'll take him

654
00:40:04,307 --> 00:40:06,021
Oh you are here

655
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,234
It's been a while

656
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:13,629
It's been about three years since I last saw it.

657
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:18,125
You told her to love someone.
Who?

658
00:40:18,738 --> 00:40:20,105
You smelly

659
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:22,570
You are making disgusting smell

660
00:40:23,850 --> 00:40:26,883
Oh sorry.
I have my hair cut

661
00:40:27,757 --> 00:40:29,991
He put oil on my hair

662
00:40:30,547 --> 00:40:32,408
You told her to love someone.
Who?

663
00:40:32,685 --> 00:40:34,552
About Kazuko's fiancee

664
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:39,104
You love him?

665
00:40:40,054 --> 00:40:41,227
That's ridiculous

666
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:44,011
We think That's not ridiculous

667
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:47,490
No, it's not.
It's too late to say so

668
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:48,681
It's okay

669
00:40:48,782 --> 00:40:53,016
Me and KAZUKO are not blood related

670
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:54,108
What the hell you are saying?

671
00:40:54,217 --> 00:40:55,830
So we can get married

672
00:40:56,014 --> 00:40:57,061
we can get married?

673
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,595
Do you think we are good couple?

674
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,370
Don't be a dick.

675
00:41:01,764 --> 00:41:02,397
I'm serious

676
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:04,761
I've been thinking about that

677
00:41:05,095 --> 00:41:09,682
I thought you declined match making because of me

678
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:12,356
You said women don't have to study.

679
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:16,969
So your head and my arm makes strong

680
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:21,249
To protect this store it is an ideal idea!

681
00:41:21,848 --> 00:41:28,425
If I married another woman, it would cost me a lot of money.

682
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,891
It will take a time to teach our work

683
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:32,861
I didn't know you were serious

684
00:41:33,203 --> 00:41:33,923
Yes

685
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:35,463
I decline you

686
00:41:35,669 --> 00:41:36,169
Why?

687
00:41:36,455 --> 00:41:40,055
I've been called you bros, I can't call you my hubby

688
00:41:40,272 --> 00:41:42,005
That is not a problem

689
00:41:42,212 --> 00:41:44,252
Call me any name

690
00:41:44,713 --> 00:41:46,907
Why are you laughing?

691
00:41:48,706 --> 00:41:49,259
Not good

692
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:50,119
NO

693
00:41:50,934 --> 00:41:52,900
I'm going to marry him

694
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,080
marry him?

695
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:55,950
Yeah

696
00:41:56,587 --> 00:42:00,327
I used to say that all men were assholes, but this is the first time I've ever admitted to being in love.

697
00:42:09,147 --> 00:42:11,474
Have you already decided?

698
00:42:12,222 --> 00:42:13,215
He does not know

699
00:42:13,704 --> 00:42:14,391
You shouldn't

700
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:16,510
He's just a businessman.

701
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:18,700
It's boring

702
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:19,360
I don't care

703
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:22,313
When he gets fired, that's the end of it.

704
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:22,844
I don't care

705
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:25,941
Kazuko also declined him

706
00:42:27,069 --> 00:42:28,529
Why do you love him?

707
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:29,192
All

708
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:34,185
You made us trouble.
Why you declined him?

709
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:37,722
I'm going out for a bit.

710
00:42:39,707 --> 00:42:40,387
Where?

711
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:42,358
I thought it would be better if I met with him and made it clear

712
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:43,518
Hanjiro?

713
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:47,077
Go see him and get back

714
00:42:47,325 --> 00:42:50,478
What's the hell?
I'll go with you

715
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,141
Don't worry

716
00:42:52,247 --> 00:42:54,956
It's more convenient for you to be with me

717
00:42:55,537 --> 00:42:57,212
I'll say for you what you have trouble saying

718
00:42:57,885 --> 00:42:59,793
I'll be ready in a minute.

719
00:43:04,291 --> 00:43:09,112
You've been out and about to see Hanjiro-san, haven't you?

720
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:11,776
You've met him many times?

721
00:43:11,948 --> 00:43:16,432
Just a few times.
He's always busy so we talk a little

722
00:43:17,217 --> 00:43:18,834
He's really serious man

723
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:19,819
What's the hell

724
00:43:27,418 --> 00:43:33,066
I don't need to see her, so please don't let her enter the company without permission.

725
00:43:34,043 --> 00:43:35,199
You're no use

726
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:39,402
I did it for you.
Shall I ask her to go home?

727
00:43:39,511 --> 00:43:40,176
Two of them

728
00:43:40,558 --> 00:43:41,652
Two of them?

729
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,847
Not only her?

730
00:43:44,324 --> 00:43:44,949
I have no idea

731
00:43:46,269 --> 00:43:47,152
I wonder who

732
00:43:51,997 --> 00:43:53,372
Hi Kazuko

733
00:43:54,396 --> 00:43:55,185
It's been a while

734
00:43:56,052 --> 00:44:00,286
I didn't think you'd turn up.
You should come to Osaka

735
00:44:00,654 --> 00:44:03,279
I was going to go to Tokyo and listen to your story.

736
00:44:04,091 --> 00:44:04,982
Hello?

737
00:44:07,224 --> 00:44:10,974
That's not why Kazuko came to Osaka, is it?

738
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,974
Kind of

739
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:14,638
How is your father?

740
00:44:14,904 --> 00:44:15,630
Yes

741
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:16,708
How about Tsuru?

742
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:17,904
Yes she's okay

743
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:20,646
If you want to talk about it, there's no need to start now.

744
00:44:20,911 --> 00:44:23,427
I've already told you how I feel about Kazuko-san.

745
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:23,927
I understand.

746
00:44:23,990 --> 00:44:24,443
I see

747
00:44:24,468 --> 00:44:25,310
Excuse me

748
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,841
If you're working, go ahead.

749
00:44:30,797 --> 00:44:32,703
He's so busy

750
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:45,886
Call the woman who never comes to the conference room to the front of the elevator.

751
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:49,683
It's hard for me

752
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:52,324
I'm counting on you

753
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:55,886
Just say there's a call?

754
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,035
Please

755
00:45:01,063 --> 00:45:02,048
there's a call

756
00:45:02,073 --> 00:45:02,610
there's a call?

757
00:45:02,892 --> 00:45:03,688
Me?

758
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:04,642
No

759
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,563
Me?

760
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:06,587
there's a call

761
00:45:09,884 --> 00:45:10,853
Here it is

762
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:20,709
there's a call for me

763
00:45:21,295 --> 00:45:22,037
I wonder who

764
00:45:22,256 --> 00:45:22,959
Me

765
00:45:24,577 --> 00:45:26,561
Please wait in the alley of the building over there

766
00:45:26,694 --> 00:45:27,374
How about Umeko?

767
00:45:27,545 --> 00:45:28,397
Don't worry

768
00:45:29,608 --> 00:45:33,217
I wanna talk with you in person

769
00:45:39,501 --> 00:45:40,235
I was sorry

770
00:45:40,352 --> 00:45:43,126
There's a call for Kazuko

771
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:44,149
I see

772
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:47,251
But I wonder why he knows Kazuko is here

773
00:45:47,276 --> 00:45:48,071
That's strange

774
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:49,829
From Who?

775
00:45:50,704 --> 00:45:52,688
From Tokyo?
I'll check it

776
00:46:25,723 --> 00:46:27,285
It was a call from a company in Osaka.

777
00:46:28,543 --> 00:46:30,980
They said it was urgent and she went home.

778
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:35,285
It's terrible of her to leave without telling us, no matter how urgent the matter.

779
00:46:35,433 --> 00:46:37,402
That's so her

780
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:42,387
She has never shown me such behavior before.

781
00:46:43,543 --> 00:46:45,652
Shall we have dinner?

782
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:46,902
I have work to do.

783
00:46:48,298 --> 00:46:50,025
I'm sorry

784
00:46:50,744 --> 00:46:53,080
I'm sorry, but it's not easy being an office worker.

785
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:57,869
I'm the one who's sorry.

786
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:13,309
Sorry I'm late

787
00:47:13,334 --> 00:47:14,418
That's a funny thing to do.

788
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:15,332
It can't be helped

789
00:47:15,543 --> 00:47:17,090
I feel sorry for Umeko

790
00:47:17,115 --> 00:47:18,348
Forget about her

791
00:47:19,293 --> 00:47:19,957
Let's go

792
00:47:37,267 --> 00:47:38,088
Where are you going?

793
00:47:38,431 --> 00:47:39,666
There's an inn down the street.

794
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:41,697
I don't wanna go

795
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,705
Don't get me wrong

796
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:47,611
It's just inn

797
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:51,611
I often go there for napping

798
00:47:51,877 --> 00:47:53,525
That's a good place to talk

799
00:47:53,791 --> 00:47:55,455
Talk about that?

800
00:47:55,931 --> 00:47:59,939
The story is very important to us

801
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:03,350
Tell me something

802
00:48:03,928 --> 00:48:05,295
I declined

803
00:48:06,795 --> 00:48:07,787
Are you frustrated?

804
00:48:08,334 --> 00:48:12,280
It's okay to say no.
If they want to let you through, they have no choice.

805
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:14,702
Why didn't you just tell me in person?

806
00:48:15,678 --> 00:48:20,803
I thought she would refuse without making you feel bad

807
00:48:22,363 --> 00:48:26,738
UMEKO likes you so much.
She wanna marry you

808
00:48:28,332 --> 00:48:31,473
And now you're recommending him instead of turning me down, and you're...

809
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:32,730
It's stupid.

810
00:48:33,668 --> 00:48:38,699
I thought I was going to marry you a long time ago.
When UMEKO told me, I didn't take it seriously.

811
00:48:39,535 --> 00:48:40,387
I was taking it easy.

812
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,355
It's sad that your mother is angry with you.

813
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:45,402
Let's be clear.

814
00:48:45,777 --> 00:48:47,371
If you don't like me, just say so.

815
00:48:47,629 --> 00:48:48,738
That's crazy.

816
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:50,230
What's the real reason?

817
00:48:50,418 --> 00:48:52,808
I tell you, I feel pain

818
00:48:57,700 --> 00:48:59,965
I don't want to be forced into it.

819
00:49:00,934 --> 00:49:04,590
My father wants me to marry him, but he doesn't want me to.

820
00:49:05,766 --> 00:49:10,118
He's the one who's gonna be the worst off when I'm gone.

821
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,610
won't you marry until your father dies?

822
00:49:14,938 --> 00:49:16,422
You don't know about my feeling

823
00:49:18,352 --> 00:49:24,039
When we get married, you'll be the only one who cooks rice and does the laundry.

824
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:30,816
I hate being a lonely father.

825
00:49:32,098 --> 00:49:34,270
I want him to be bossy all the time.

826
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:39,839
Don't cry

827
00:49:49,932 --> 00:49:50,675
Sorry

828
00:49:51,643 --> 00:49:52,878
I'm a little foggy.

829
00:49:54,093 --> 00:49:57,694
I can't see your face well without my glasses

830
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,280
I'm a little foggy.

831
00:50:02,801 --> 00:50:04,114
Keep being foggy.

832
00:50:05,543 --> 00:50:07,348
You don't have to think about anything.

833
00:50:19,907 --> 00:50:25,329
I didn't know you thought so much of me.

834
00:50:28,071 --> 00:50:30,720
I hope I have a power

835
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:35,102
I wonder if money is the answer.

836
00:50:36,072 --> 00:50:36,830
money?

837
00:50:38,877 --> 00:50:44,096
Hire a housekeeper. to take care of your father. to take care of your father.

838
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:47,549
Can passion solve the problem?

839
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:48,416
You can't

840
00:50:49,541 --> 00:50:53,221
I can't be foolhardy if you insist on that.

841
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:58,659
That's what you are, isn't it?

842
00:50:59,174 --> 00:51:01,151
I'm sorry I said those horrible things earlier.

843
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:03,526
what shall we do now?

844
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:04,510
What do you mean?

845
00:51:05,026 --> 00:51:07,268
Go home?
I'll see off

846
00:51:08,018 --> 00:51:08,995
where are you staying?

847
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:13,502
I want to go home alone

848
00:51:14,573 --> 00:51:15,643
I wanna cry

849
00:51:16,213 --> 00:51:16,784
Why?

850
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:20,627
because my glasses were broken

851
00:52:37,825 --> 00:52:39,278
We are Yotaro

852
00:52:40,325 --> 00:52:43,333
What's wrong,Kazuko?

853
00:52:44,013 --> 00:52:45,614
Where are you?

854
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:48,606
I decided to go home tonight

855
00:52:49,309 --> 00:52:52,903
So See you in Tokyo

856
00:52:54,075 --> 00:52:56,958
What's wrong?

857
00:52:57,911 --> 00:52:59,442
Hello?

858
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,552
Oh she hung up

859
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:14,325
I'm sure you're busy at the store right now.
Are you sure?

860
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:16,434
I'm here for a drink.

861
00:53:17,052 --> 00:53:19,520
It feels good to have a drink at another restaurant?

862
00:53:20,059 --> 00:53:22,309
I don't mean that

863
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:24,325
abalone please

864
00:53:25,145 --> 00:53:26,723
Salted fish is recommended at this restaurant.

865
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,138
I'll have it

866
00:53:28,434 --> 00:53:29,622
wanna drink?

867
00:53:29,716 --> 00:53:30,989
Thank you

868
00:53:31,177 --> 00:53:32,575
I don't understand

869
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,208
For what?

870
00:53:33,817 --> 00:53:35,138
About women

871
00:53:35,919 --> 00:53:37,341
What's wrong?

872
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:38,661
It's none of your business

873
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:40,989
I see

874
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:44,083
I don't understand either

875
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:48,208
Welcome

876
00:53:53,145 --> 00:53:54,020
Can I sit here?

877
00:53:54,153 --> 00:53:55,356
Go ahead

878
00:53:58,348 --> 00:53:59,231
One Sake

879
00:54:03,302 --> 00:54:05,755
you use good expressions

880
00:54:05,927 --> 00:54:07,895
I feel like that

881
00:54:08,098 --> 00:54:11,458
are you in the same situation as me?

882
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:15,158
A woman who said she didn't want to get married suddenly said she wanted to get married.

883
00:54:15,643 --> 00:54:17,237
That's not bad

884
00:54:17,596 --> 00:54:20,596
Not with me but with other man

885
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:22,455
that's a big problem

886
00:54:23,002 --> 00:54:24,018
Right?

887
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,252
what kind of man is that?

888
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,213
He's boring man

889
00:54:31,174 --> 00:54:33,987
he is a useless man who is dumped by a woman

890
00:54:34,385 --> 00:54:35,901
He's bad

891
00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:37,260
He's bad

892
00:54:37,354 --> 00:54:38,447
He's bad

893
00:54:39,252 --> 00:54:40,471
why are you disappointed?

894
00:54:40,682 --> 00:54:42,276
I failed the exam

895
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:43,729
Women?

896
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:47,604
I failed the entrance exam because I am a night college student.

897
00:54:47,971 --> 00:54:49,455
That's the life

898
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:51,893
If I can't find a job, I can't get married.

899
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:56,050
Women are the problem

900
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,523
Are you feeling bad?

901
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,170
Hi Kazuko

902
00:55:48,038 --> 00:55:49,038
Are you still here?

903
00:55:49,404 --> 00:55:50,651
I'm here

904
00:55:58,797 --> 00:56:00,391
You gonna bed?

905
00:56:02,987 --> 00:56:04,928
I wanna eat rice gruel

906
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:07,287
Ok I'll prepare it

907
00:56:08,546 --> 00:56:09,786
You should go to blind date

908
00:56:10,596 --> 00:56:12,103
You'll be late

909
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,554
I'm going

910
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:17,717
How can I cook rice gruel?

911
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,457
Put some water than normal

912
00:56:20,114 --> 00:56:23,706
Where's the thermometer?

913
00:56:24,299 --> 00:56:25,546
It's in medicine box

914
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,123
How about the medicine?

915
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:28,557
I'll check it

916
00:56:29,413 --> 00:56:32,233
I'll manage it.
You should go to work

917
00:56:42,951 --> 00:56:46,998
My stomach's rumbling.
Can you prepare hot-water bottle for me?

918
00:56:52,332 --> 00:56:53,812
I'm home

919
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:56,474
You are still here

920
00:56:56,644 --> 00:56:58,144
You'll have date today,Right?

921
00:56:58,511 --> 00:56:59,137
Yeah

922
00:57:08,973 --> 00:57:11,786
What are you doing?
You have a blind date at noon.

923
00:57:12,423 --> 00:57:14,403
You'll be late

924
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,380
I won't

925
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,267
Why?

926
00:57:16,935 --> 00:57:18,488
My father isn't feeling well.

927
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:22,483
He always pretends he's sick.

928
00:57:23,143 --> 00:57:27,743
Last night my father told me to be sure to go.

929
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,794
I'm glad I wasn't home last night.

930
00:57:31,497 --> 00:57:35,650
You won't be married for a while?

931
00:57:37,163 --> 00:57:39,849
You declined Hanjiro.
You are too good

932
00:57:40,858 --> 00:57:42,898
Or do you see anyone now?

933
00:57:43,892 --> 00:57:44,639
Tell me

934
00:57:44,672 --> 00:57:45,739
Shut up

935
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:46,596
No

936
00:57:47,896 --> 00:57:52,769
There's someone I really love.
If he proposes to your sister, you'll marry him?

937
00:57:53,455 --> 00:57:54,168
No

938
00:57:54,714 --> 00:57:57,341
I wanna marry to Tecchan

939
00:57:57,753 --> 00:57:59,813
With Tecchan?

940
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:02,110
With Tecchan

941
00:58:03,934 --> 00:58:06,808
I think he's nice

942
00:58:09,323 --> 00:58:11,256
He's suitable with me

943
00:58:11,636 --> 00:58:13,323
He has no job

944
00:58:13,616 --> 00:58:14,089
He found

945
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:15,509
a few days ago

946
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,416
I didn't know

947
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:20,609
I should celebrate him

948
00:58:20,795 --> 00:58:22,442
So can I?

949
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,524
I think you can

950
00:58:24,594 --> 00:58:25,734
So can you tell him?

951
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:26,574
For what?

952
00:58:27,242 --> 00:58:29,416
Tell him I wanna marry him

953
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:30,846
What's the hell?

954
00:58:31,563 --> 00:58:33,316
You should talk him in person

955
00:58:34,049 --> 00:58:35,789
I can't

956
00:58:36,076 --> 00:58:37,222
You're stupid

957
00:58:38,550 --> 00:58:42,430
It's Sunday.
Tecchan's there. You should go tonight.

958
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:46,282
You can't just say that.
I'll have to talk to your father about it.

959
00:58:46,448 --> 00:58:48,295
He's nothing to worry about.

960
00:58:50,936 --> 00:58:51,696
I'm home.

961
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,547
You back early

962
00:58:54,642 --> 00:58:56,315
You're still here

963
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:57,257
I won't go

964
00:58:57,650 --> 00:58:58,277
I see

965
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,907
It's ok

966
00:59:01,657 --> 00:59:04,571
He doesn't look good in the picture.

967
00:59:05,172 --> 00:59:08,812
Don't worry.
I'll call them to decline

968
00:59:11,123 --> 00:59:12,616
I'm hungry

969
00:59:13,844 --> 00:59:15,164
Wanna eat eel?

970
00:59:15,386 --> 00:59:16,433
Who treat?

971
00:59:16,459 --> 00:59:18,373
I got paid

972
00:59:18,654 --> 00:59:21,301
Unemployment insurance, right?

973
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:22,268
Yeah

974
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:24,928
You spend money quickly.

975
00:59:25,627 --> 00:59:27,381
You should save your money

976
00:59:27,573 --> 00:59:30,333
Order 3 dishes

977
00:59:32,341 --> 00:59:34,094
You told me you had a stomach ache

978
00:59:35,147 --> 00:59:38,360
I got better after going to toilet

979
00:59:41,082 --> 00:59:44,009
You should call them for the time being

980
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:54,506
Who?
I can't catch you

981
00:59:55,087 --> 00:59:57,447
Could you please clarify?
I'm busy.

982
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:03,024
Kazuko-san.
Kazuko Ota?

983
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:05,021
I'm sorry.

984
01:00:06,366 --> 01:00:08,466
Do you have something important to tell me?

985
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:13,763
I'll visit you anywhere.
To the office? I'll be right there.

986
01:00:15,056 --> 01:00:17,409
I'm free.

987
01:00:31,358 --> 01:00:34,484
Sorry to call you here.

988
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,647
This is the only place I could find.

989
01:00:37,615 --> 01:00:40,990
I feel more at home but

990
01:00:41,116 --> 01:00:42,342
location does not matter

991
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:46,178
I am here about marriage talk

992
01:00:46,491 --> 01:00:47,077
marriage?

993
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,522
Do you have a fiancee?

994
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:50,530
No

995
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,639
I'm glad to hear that

996
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:54,835
Well..about me?

997
01:00:55,092 --> 01:00:55,585
Yes

998
01:00:56,296 --> 01:01:00,178
I didn't expect that.

999
01:01:00,663 --> 01:01:06,272
I don't know how to say this.
I'm grateful.

1000
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:10,506
It's hard to say something like this when you're close to someone, isn't it?

1001
01:01:10,624 --> 01:01:11,444
I agree.

1002
01:01:11,983 --> 01:01:15,444
I'm relieved.
I'm sure I'll be able to do my job easily.

1003
01:01:15,874 --> 01:01:16,350
What's that?

1004
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,678
Tsuru-chan can't say it herself.

1005
01:01:20,530 --> 01:01:21,671
Oh about Michiko

1006
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:27,725
She says she can't honestly tell you how she feels.

1007
01:01:28,077 --> 01:01:28,686
But

1008
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:32,741
I didn't understand her feelings at all

1009
01:01:33,663 --> 01:01:34,967
You knew it

1010
01:01:36,022 --> 01:01:42,358
The girl I like is highly educated, so I studied hard myself.

1011
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:43,835
She has only high school diploma

1012
01:01:44,178 --> 01:01:47,038
I thought that if I couldn't work, I wouldn't be aware of applying for marriage.

1013
01:01:47,663 --> 01:01:50,897
A company with eight employees... that I've decided to join.

1014
01:01:51,350 --> 01:01:52,210
What company?

1015
01:01:52,499 --> 01:01:53,608
We sell sandal

1016
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:55,842
Sandal?

1017
01:01:56,139 --> 01:01:58,913
I heard that there are many orders from overseas.

1018
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:03,288
I think our company will grow from now on

1019
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,663
I plan to change jobs in the future

1020
01:02:06,069 --> 01:02:09,585
I feel like you're working hard every day

1021
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:13,271
I think Tsuru like that kind of part of you

1022
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:18,021
my monthly salary is low.
When she get married, she will quit your current job, right?

1023
01:02:18,209 --> 01:02:23,232
She's just like you, but she's got something on her mind.

1024
01:02:23,967 --> 01:02:25,943
you two should talk

1025
01:02:26,217 --> 01:02:28,865
Me and Michiko?

1026
01:02:29,076 --> 01:02:31,537
Ms.KAzuko Aota. someone is visiting you

1027
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:33,740
Me?
Who?

1028
01:02:34,928 --> 01:02:38,404
Come to my house after you tell TSURU that you'll congratulate me on my new job.

1029
01:03:06,987 --> 01:03:08,511
See you then

1030
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:15,639
Are you busy?

1031
01:03:17,912 --> 01:03:20,381
I'm here for a minute.
Tokyo.

1032
01:03:22,412 --> 01:03:23,420
I'll be back

1033
01:03:24,100 --> 01:03:26,647
Transfer to Tokyo?

1034
01:03:27,815 --> 01:03:30,120
I came to see a little of the state of my house

1035
01:03:31,002 --> 01:03:33,081
You rented a house in Suginami Ward to someone.

1036
01:03:33,174 --> 01:03:35,948
I'm talking to my mother about it

1037
01:03:36,612 --> 01:03:37,596
Your mom's also back in Tokyo?

1038
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,417
She's still in Osaka

1039
01:03:41,437 --> 01:03:42,781
I'll marry with someone

1040
01:03:43,843 --> 01:03:44,468
I see

1041
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:48,140
With Umeko

1042
01:03:48,656 --> 01:03:51,023
That's good

1043
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:53,265
you think so?

1044
01:03:54,336 --> 01:03:55,883
I knew you would.

1045
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,640
she is very pushy

1046
01:03:58,665 --> 01:03:59,445
You lost?

1047
01:04:02,359 --> 01:04:03,359
I can't help it.

1048
01:04:04,164 --> 01:04:06,000
Good for you

1049
01:04:06,664 --> 01:04:11,133
I think you and her are very well balanced.

1050
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:13,812
you have a very strong personality

1051
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:14,875
You're mean

1052
01:04:17,118 --> 01:04:18,602
But it could be

1053
01:04:19,126 --> 01:04:21,149
No, I'm kidding.

1054
01:04:21,508 --> 01:04:24,680
I'm sorry I'm late

1055
01:04:24,946 --> 01:04:26,743
How are you?

1056
01:04:27,915 --> 01:04:29,165
you guys came to Tokyo together?

1057
01:04:29,383 --> 01:04:34,329
He went to Tokyo yesterday I went to Tokyo today

1058
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:40,102
How was your house?

1059
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,227
my mother seems ready to meet you

1060
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:46,844
but let's go home together

1061
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:48,032
Your work ok?

1062
01:04:48,057 --> 01:04:51,016
I will go to the department store again tomorrow

1063
01:04:51,462 --> 01:04:52,649
see you tonight

1064
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:58,610
I'll be on the train tonight, so I won't be able to visit you.
Give my regards to your father.

1065
01:05:01,529 --> 01:05:03,654
Goodbye
Have a good day.

1066
01:05:13,529 --> 01:05:15,498
Tecchan,what's wrong?

1067
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:20,326
I've met this person before...

1068
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:21,389
Umeko?

1069
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:22,654
That guy

1070
01:05:23,506 --> 01:05:26,522
Where was I?
Was it a dream?

1071
01:05:27,631 --> 01:05:28,381
Do you know him?

1072
01:05:28,545 --> 01:05:30,428
I have to go for work

1073
01:05:33,176 --> 01:05:39,325
I can't be so sure in front of her.
I'm so bad

1074
01:05:42,091 --> 01:05:44,044
She'll be just my friend

1075
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,216
He's sleeping

1076
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:58,067
He's tired.
He says he's heartbroken.

1077
01:05:58,449 --> 01:06:01,200
Sleeping with a broken heart... that's weird.

1078
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,528
You can see better if you adjust the size

1079
01:06:16,278 --> 01:06:18,966
this fabric is very good

1080
01:06:19,903 --> 01:06:21,606
this is really great

1081
01:06:22,638 --> 01:06:26,395
The fabric is the most important thing for a suit

1082
01:06:26,911 --> 01:06:29,997
We offer low prices

1083
01:06:30,372 --> 01:06:33,966
Will it be in time for the wedding day?

1084
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,458
I will definitely make it in time by that day

1085
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:40,809
this is really great

1086
01:06:42,919 --> 01:06:44,450
You look so good

1087
01:06:47,364 --> 01:06:51,575
He has almost completed all the preparations for the establishment of the company.

1088
01:06:52,270 --> 01:06:56,122
But this is a concrete company and I've never done it.

1089
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:58,559
More and more houses are made of reinforced concrete

1090
01:06:59,692 --> 01:07:02,739
I hear there are many orders

1091
01:07:03,981 --> 01:07:08,403
Mr. Nakamura has a business acumen and owns a lot of stock in this company.

1092
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:13,825
He wanted a companion he could trust.
You just need to follow him

1093
01:07:15,591 --> 01:07:19,911
There are a lot of strange people around these days.
Just keep it serious.

1094
01:07:21,841 --> 01:07:23,020
Good

1095
01:07:24,403 --> 01:07:25,880
not what I expected

1096
01:07:26,114 --> 01:07:30,536
You found a new job, and the salary is low at first, but I think it's good.

1097
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,145
See you then

1098
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:46,490
who will marry?

1099
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:49,537
Why you didn't tell me

1100
01:07:50,396 --> 01:07:53,224
Not ours but just my friend's

1101
01:07:53,607 --> 01:07:55,084
Not for Kazuko?

1102
01:07:55,935 --> 01:07:59,162
I wanted to make you some tea

1103
01:07:59,310 --> 01:08:05,318
It's strange to keep other daughter's deposit instead of your own daughter's.

1104
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:10,287
Oh yours?

1105
01:08:11,607 --> 01:08:12,615
Oh sorry

1106
01:08:28,899 --> 01:08:30,110
There’s a lot

1107
01:08:30,298 --> 01:08:32,641
I contacted many people

1108
01:08:33,985 --> 01:08:35,743
you are quiet today

1109
01:08:36,102 --> 01:08:36,719
Me?

1110
01:08:37,391 --> 01:08:38,235
You don't go out?

1111
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:43,579
I’m all ready for wedding

1112
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:46,415
all my stuff has been moved

1113
01:08:47,235 --> 01:08:49,712
HANJIRO came to make a suit today.

1114
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:51,407
You're good

1115
01:08:52,188 --> 01:08:53,923
You did everything by yourself.

1116
01:08:54,149 --> 01:08:56,321
my brother is too busy to prepare

1117
01:08:57,048 --> 01:08:58,548
is he coming to the wedding?

1118
01:08:58,782 --> 01:09:00,680
He said he would come to Tokyo for the wedding.

1119
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:05,438
I'm going back to work.

1120
01:09:06,571 --> 01:09:09,102
I'm happy for you.

1121
01:09:09,618 --> 01:09:11,571
Congratulations.

1122
01:09:12,368 --> 01:09:13,555
Is it that good?

1123
01:09:13,829 --> 01:09:17,180
Of course, Kazuko...
TSURU-chan will be happy too.

1124
01:09:18,746 --> 01:09:22,293
I have something to tell you

1125
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:23,246
What?

1126
01:09:23,574 --> 01:09:25,223
would you marry someone?

1127
01:09:25,566 --> 01:09:26,004
Who?

1128
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:28,543
Anyone ok

1129
01:09:28,887 --> 01:09:30,707
I'm not into it

1130
01:09:31,152 --> 01:09:32,746
it's very annoying

1131
01:09:33,262 --> 01:09:34,667
Who?

1132
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:35,332
Kazuko

1133
01:09:35,644 --> 01:09:36,301
Kazuko?

1134
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:37,996
what did she say to you?

1135
01:09:38,027 --> 01:09:40,559
She didn't

1136
01:09:40,848 --> 01:09:47,066
If you don't get married, Kazuko can't get married.

1137
01:09:47,598 --> 01:09:48,566
No way

1138
01:09:48,894 --> 01:09:51,332
you are disturbing her marriage

1139
01:09:51,934 --> 01:09:52,762
No way

1140
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:53,629
You are

1141
01:09:54,848 --> 01:09:55,566
Really?

1142
01:09:55,715 --> 01:10:00,566
she will get married as soon as she is free

1143
01:10:00,816 --> 01:10:02,074
as soon as she is free...

1144
01:10:04,793 --> 01:10:07,606
But I wonder if Kazuko is even thinking about it.

1145
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:10,027
Why don't you tell her you're getting married?

1146
01:10:10,715 --> 01:10:14,847
I have no intention of getting married

1147
01:10:15,340 --> 01:10:17,129
I don't care about you

1148
01:10:18,004 --> 01:10:24,136
what do Kazuko, look like?
She'll have a bright look on her face and say congratulations.

1149
01:10:25,090 --> 01:10:26,637
you say terrible things

1150
01:10:26,965 --> 01:10:27,684
I'm sorry.

1151
01:10:28,043 --> 01:10:33,277
It's ok.
You're her friend

1152
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:36,699
But what a strange woman you are, too.

1153
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:41,793
You're worried about Kazuko's marriage while you're keeping Kazuko's fiancée.

1154
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,589
you say terrible things too

1155
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:16,622
it's like I’m getting married

1156
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:19,973
you are an inexperienced man

1157
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:24,184
you should support her

1158
01:11:24,411 --> 01:11:28,442
Why do they have a wedding in Osaka?

1159
01:11:28,653 --> 01:11:34,153
I feel sorry for her to have her wedding at such a small wedding hall.

1160
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:38,122
Kimono with her is a rental kimono

1161
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:43,512
she refused it.
I wanted to be like a salary man's wife

1162
01:11:47,952 --> 01:11:52,483
Why did you make the clothes at the clothing store that used to make school uniforms?

1163
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:55,280
I made a suit there when I entered the company too

1164
01:11:55,881 --> 01:11:59,045
What if it doesn't arrive in time for the wedding?

1165
01:12:02,682 --> 01:12:04,463
I'm sorry I'm late.

1166
01:12:04,877 --> 01:12:06,135
It didn't mean to be late.

1167
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,517
It's just that... it's not all finished yet.

1168
01:12:08,542 --> 01:12:09,400
Not yet?

1169
01:12:09,433 --> 01:12:10,541
What will you do?

1170
01:12:10,596 --> 01:12:12,057
He can just try it

1171
01:12:24,164 --> 01:12:27,195
It's not all on the back, but I'm sure you're just a little bummed out.

1172
01:12:27,507 --> 01:12:29,226
They won't know once you put it on.

1173
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:29,992
You're right.

1174
01:12:30,499 --> 01:12:34,335
It's not good to wear unfinished clothes

1175
01:12:36,242 --> 01:12:42,468
I caught a cold and had a very high fever yesterday.

1176
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:53,011
Please take off your jacket and let Hanjiro put it on.

1177
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,990
It's just fitting

1178
01:13:18,130 --> 01:13:20,482
lend him the clothes

1179
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,138
Thank you

1180
01:13:23,295 --> 01:13:26,045
I look so funny when I take off my jacket

1181
01:13:26,755 --> 01:13:28,380
I'm fine with a normal suit

1182
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:30,107
This is better

1183
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:37,505
It seems that there are no more rental costumes at this ceremony hall.

1184
01:13:49,841 --> 01:13:52,279
we are going to go to the wedding venue in 5 minutes.

1185
01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:54,943
Your nose gets messy

1186
01:14:03,627 --> 01:14:04,642
This is better

1187
01:14:08,789 --> 01:14:09,539
Thanks

1188
01:14:09,875 --> 01:14:11,367
It's ok

1189
01:14:11,945 --> 01:14:15,344
Thanks.
I knew.

1190
01:14:16,656 --> 01:14:23,984
I knew you liked him.
You said that it's okay for me and him to fall in love

1191
01:14:24,758 --> 01:14:26,359
then will you give him back to me?

1192
01:14:26,586 --> 01:14:28,172
No way, I won't

1193
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:30,109
Sorry

1194
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:36,375
You're romantic

1195
01:14:37,516 --> 01:14:41,516
Tsuru-chan should have come here too.

1196
01:14:42,008 --> 01:14:44,742
She said she wasn't interested in someone else's marriage.

1197
01:14:45,172 --> 01:14:46,719
she speaks clearly

1198
01:14:47,125 --> 01:14:49,203
she said she was going on a trip

1199
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:53,703
She said she would go to Tecchan's house in the country and do some research.

1200
01:14:54,234 --> 01:14:57,250
She got in as soon as he could, took three days off.

1201
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:07,191
Yes that's right

1202
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:10,122
Do I look good?

1203
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,459
I'm the best man

1204
01:15:12,650 --> 01:15:13,984
What the hell?

1205
01:15:18,335 --> 01:15:21,302
Oh I remember who you are

1206
01:15:22,005 --> 01:15:23,832
I know you

1207
01:15:24,024 --> 01:15:25,891
Oh my god

1208
01:15:26,892 --> 01:15:31,166
You told me I was a lousy man who was dumped by a woman.

1209
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:35,771
I worry he still remember me

1210
01:15:59,610 --> 01:16:00,270
I'm home

1211
01:16:01,636 --> 01:16:03,110
I'm here to greet you

1212
01:16:03,442 --> 01:16:04,615
Please come in

1213
01:16:04,702 --> 01:16:06,015
Upstairs is better

1214
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:14,313
There are many rooms here

1215
01:16:14,939 --> 01:16:17,285
Our house is much smaller

1216
01:16:17,538 --> 01:16:22,598
I have remodeled my entryway in many ways.

1217
01:16:24,185 --> 01:16:27,705
If I carry my wife's stuff, I'll have no place to sleep.

1218
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:34,273
I'm busy with various things since they suddenly decided to get married.

1219
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:36,135
Don't worry about me

1220
01:16:38,406 --> 01:16:39,860
Thanks in advance

1221
01:16:40,293 --> 01:16:41,173
So do I

1222
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:45,227
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

1223
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:49,253
They went on their honeymoon.

1224
01:16:49,572 --> 01:16:53,185
I just wanted to drop you a line after I saw them off.

1225
01:16:54,664 --> 01:16:57,477
Thank you very much for your cooperation.

1226
01:16:57,796 --> 01:17:01,423
It's like my daughter is getting married.

1227
01:17:04,809 --> 01:17:08,950
I thought Kazuko were going to marry him.

1228
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,460
I'm sorry about that.

1229
01:17:11,912 --> 01:17:16,205
That's not what I meant.
And my late husband had every intention of doing so.

1230
01:17:16,446 --> 01:17:17,240
So do I

1231
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:20,923
Umeko shouldn't transfered to Osaka

1232
01:17:21,662 --> 01:17:24,162
She ended up to back to Tokyo

1233
01:17:24,241 --> 01:17:26,714
Umeko is good woman

1234
01:17:27,125 --> 01:17:28,765
I think so

1235
01:17:29,496 --> 01:17:32,129
She'll open her store at the department store

1236
01:17:32,779 --> 01:17:35,972
Umeko will be the manager for Tokyo branch?

1237
01:17:38,694 --> 01:17:41,080
Your store these days has been changed

1238
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,091
Excuse me

1239
01:18:14,151 --> 01:18:16,264
Please stay here for relax

1240
01:18:16,617 --> 01:18:20,204
I know you are more tired than I

1241
01:18:20,598 --> 01:18:22,492
Sorry to disturb you

1242
01:18:25,932 --> 01:18:27,539
Good night

1243
01:18:37,987 --> 01:18:38,707
How was it?

1244
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:40,640
It was a grand wedding ceremony.

1245
01:18:42,610 --> 01:18:43,517
That's good

1246
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:49,371
I'm going to miss her after I send her off to get married.

1247
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:51,281
She's very cheerful so

1248
01:19:04,265 --> 01:19:08,412
Kazuko,I'm gonna get married.

1249
01:19:09,686 --> 01:19:10,380
With who?

1250
01:19:11,843 --> 01:19:13,450
I'm gonna get married.

1251
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:14,700
You're lair

1252
01:19:15,420 --> 01:19:16,627
I'm gonna get married.

1253
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:17,582
You're lair

1254
01:19:20,807 --> 01:19:21,481
You think so?

1255
01:19:22,094 --> 01:19:23,281
You're lair

1256
01:19:24,175 --> 01:19:24,662
Why?

1257
01:19:25,293 --> 01:19:25,846
What?

1258
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:27,279
Why you say so?

1259
01:19:41,635 --> 01:19:45,035
Kazuko,.
There are many things in life.

1260
01:19:46,016 --> 01:19:51,082
In their youth, they are very possessive.
They want to own everything.

1261
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:56,458
But as we get older, we're gradually forced to give that up.

1262
01:19:57,595 --> 01:20:02,868
No ambition in life, no job, no money, no life partner.

1263
01:20:03,759 --> 01:20:07,853
Your mother's dead.
Not that I abandoned her.

1264
01:20:08,564 --> 01:20:11,415
But it's the same thing emotionally.

1265
01:20:12,337 --> 01:20:18,274
No matter how many things happened along the way, we are born alone and we die alone.

1266
01:20:28,001 --> 01:20:33,103
I'm a sailor, and I used to think about that at night on the sea.

1267
01:20:34,510 --> 01:20:36,697
I'm alone at the end.

1268
01:20:39,104 --> 01:20:40,854
I feel lonely

1269
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:44,260
I won't miss it
That's a given.

1270
01:20:49,565 --> 01:20:54,143
But I'd been so careless, I'd forgotten to throw her away.

1271
01:20:54,963 --> 01:20:57,759
I thought she was mine.

1272
01:20:59,158 --> 01:21:01,213
That'd be okay

1273
01:21:01,799 --> 01:21:06,986
Being away from your own children is the
The last and biggest test of your life.

1274
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:10,579
It's difficult.

1275
01:21:24,002 --> 01:21:27,799
Kazuko, let's leave each other alone.

1276
01:21:28,416 --> 01:21:29,049
No

1277
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:35,416
Don't be afraid of being alone.
You do what you want to do.

1278
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,190
Marriage or work?

1279
01:21:39,370 --> 01:21:39,940
I don't have

1280
01:21:40,471 --> 01:21:41,330
You have

1281
01:21:42,612 --> 01:21:45,846
Dad, if you leave me.
I'll go to America.

1282
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:49,495
America.
You have a job?

1283
01:21:49,932 --> 01:21:53,955
The company wants me to study in America.

1284
01:21:53,980 --> 01:21:56,182
I think it's good
I think it's better to go

1285
01:21:58,861 --> 01:22:01,994
You go by ship

1286
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:05,143
Or airplane

1287
01:22:05,682 --> 01:22:08,471
We haven't even gotten to that point yet.

1288
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:11,394
I think it's better to go

1289
01:22:11,777 --> 01:22:12,871
Can I?

1290
01:22:13,003 --> 01:22:13,894
Yes

1291
01:22:14,308 --> 01:22:16,706
I felt like I was waiting for your permission

1292
01:22:18,378 --> 01:22:19,035
I'm sorry, Dad.

1293
01:22:21,206 --> 01:22:22,730
I'll go.

1294
01:22:28,013 --> 01:22:28,740
Take care

1295
01:22:43,761 --> 01:22:49,269
Tsuru and Tecchan got married, but they don't have a house, so I think they will live in this house.

1296
01:22:50,378 --> 01:22:52,456
I will give them the second floor

1297
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:58,769
I think they will cook for me

1298
01:22:59,277 --> 01:23:00,269
You are cheeky

1299
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:01,597
Why?

1300
01:23:02,042 --> 01:23:05,144
That was your plan all along.

1301
01:23:05,901 --> 01:23:07,057
you shouldn't have cried

1302
01:23:09,182 --> 01:23:12,362
But, you know... you really should get married.

1303
01:23:13,065 --> 01:23:14,214
will you preach to me?

1304
01:23:14,956 --> 01:23:17,229
You're still nice

1305
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:21,836
Applications are pouring in.

1306
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:23,922
Don't say bullshit

1307
01:23:26,406 --> 01:23:30,414
I think HANJIRO lost out by marrying Umeko.

1308
01:23:30,649 --> 01:23:32,836
He looked nice at wedding

1309
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:34,164
I see

1310
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:01,862
You'd better put your glass off

1311
01:24:02,683 --> 01:24:05,339
you should not wear glasses

1312
01:24:05,690 --> 01:24:07,487
If you can't see it, it can't be helped

1313
01:24:07,573 --> 01:24:08,862
I will put it off

1314
01:24:25,999 --> 01:24:32,006
Middle-aged women have become beautiful in Japan recently.

1315
01:24:33,324 --> 01:24:35,176
It's spring

1316
01:24:35,605 --> 01:24:37,512
Yeah, it's MArch

1317
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:40,176
he is going to blackmail me

1318
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:41,660
For what?

1319
01:24:42,058 --> 01:24:44,949
hey, Umeko

1320
01:24:50,410 --> 01:24:51,902
they don't look like a couple at all

1321
01:24:52,035 --> 01:24:53,777
you will be like them

1322
01:24:53,832 --> 01:24:55,340
We'll definitely not

1323
01:24:55,926 --> 01:24:57,738
hey, Umeko

1324
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:01,910
hey, Umeko

1325
01:25:02,277 --> 01:25:03,183
Stop doing it

1326
01:26:25,675 --> 01:26:32,136
THE END

<i>Maiko Monogatari (1954)</i>

3
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:39,523
A train departing from Tokyo is currently arriving at platform 4.

4
00:01:46,047 --> 00:01:48,633
Kyoto.Kyoto.

5
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,898
Arrived in Kyoto

6
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:59,874
You can transfer here

7
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:02,384
Thank you very much.

8
00:02:02,409 --> 00:02:03,789
Take care.

9
00:02:04,766 --> 00:02:05,781
See you.

10
00:02:07,555 --> 00:02:08,750
Oh Tome!

11
00:02:09,242 --> 00:02:10,209
Over here!

12
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,992
Thank you for coming early.

13
00:02:13,017 --> 00:02:14,937
I think you're tired after a long train ride.

14
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,773
How is your mother?

15
00:02:16,798 --> 00:02:19,828
I hope she's doing well.
Let's go to the hospital together.

16
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:23,961
Eiji.
Welcome back.

17
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,141
Is she someone you know?

18
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,961
She was next to me.

19
00:02:31,164 --> 00:02:33,243
Will you come to my house tonight?

20
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,039
It's my birthday.

21
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,860
I forgot about that.

22
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,774
Mom.

23
00:03:11,874 --> 00:03:17,937
I'm glad you came back.
You didn't have to force yourself to come back.

24
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:26,562
I can't concentrate on studying until I see how mom is doing for a minute

25
00:03:26,587 --> 00:03:30,062
that's true. You don't have to worry because you're well-off

26
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,586
I told her not to worry and that she could come.

27
00:03:36,555 --> 00:03:38,250
I'm sorry for making you worry.

28
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:46,331
What are you saying? It's better for you to have her by your side

29
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:49,851
I've been taking care of you.

30
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:52,055
What is your temperature today?

31
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:57,734
It seems good.

32
00:03:58,008 --> 00:04:00,821
so please take care of yourself

33
00:04:00,914 --> 00:04:01,993
Thank you very much.

34
00:04:02,258 --> 00:04:06,211
Our work is lonely without you.

35
00:04:07,368 --> 00:04:09,313
I'm not that important.

36
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:11,500
Really.

37
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:16,274
Will you return with me?

38
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,765
I'm going to stay right here by my mother's side

39
00:04:18,836 --> 00:04:21,008
You're good.

40
00:04:21,524 --> 00:04:24,571
Please do that.
You are the only two parents.

41
00:04:25,055 --> 00:04:30,538
I have a party today.
Take care.

42
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,078
I'll be here again.

43
00:04:34,586 --> 00:04:36,032
Please look after her.

44
00:04:36,391 --> 00:04:37,750
See you.

45
00:04:40,008 --> 00:04:41,625
Take care.

46
00:04:47,035 --> 00:04:50,035
How about your condition?

47
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:52,961
Are you okay if you don't go to school?

48
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,023
It's ok.Even if I take a little break, I'll show you that I can make up for it quickly.

49
00:04:57,282 --> 00:04:58,438
I'm smart.

50
00:05:02,419 --> 00:05:06,836
What are you planning to do if you graduate?

51
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:11,711
I want to go back to Kyoto and do clinical work at my father's hospital

52
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,050
I think your father would be pleased with that.

53
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:26,220
You two should take your time and enjoy your conversation.

54
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:29,008
Thank you.

55
00:05:29,164 --> 00:05:30,633
Are there any other customers here?

56
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:33,789
Yoko left it just the two of us.
let's start.

57
00:05:55,798 --> 00:05:57,203
Happy birthday!

58
00:05:58,485 --> 00:05:59,625
Congratulations!

59
00:05:59,773 --> 00:06:00,671
Thank you

60
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:04,265
Welcome back!

61
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:08,711
Sorry for being so late, it's been a while

62
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,317
Dad, congratulations

63
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:17,380
Brother, today is my birthday.

64
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:18,961
Sorry.

65
00:06:19,118 --> 00:06:20,243
Congratulations!

66
00:06:20,352 --> 00:06:21,782
It's like you're married.

67
00:06:22,156 --> 00:06:23,117
It's kind of that.

68
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:36,883
Since I saw your face and instantly I became lively again

69
00:06:37,694 --> 00:06:41,765
Don't worry about me. I'll be back in Tokyo in a few days.

70
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:43,836
I will do that.

71
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,215
but your is so energetic

72
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,984
I feel relieved

73
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,953
But since I've finally come back, I'll do my best to look after you.

74
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,586
That's silly, there's no need to take that seriously, is there?

75
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,305
Please eat that meal quickly.

76
00:07:09,309 --> 00:07:11,499
Have a eat.

77
00:07:12,087 --> 00:07:16,804
I've been on the train all this time so my stomach's not feeling well.

78
00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:18,234
That's bad.

79
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,695
So, what happened?

80
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,750
Well.

81
00:07:40,664 --> 00:07:41,547
Is there something wrong?

82
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:48,336
You look like you're in pain

83
00:07:48,657 --> 00:07:49,391
Yes.

84
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:52,657
Do you have a stomach ache?

85
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:02,731
I'll bring you some water now.
Please eat this.

86
00:08:02,844 --> 00:08:03,641
Sorry about that.

87
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,430
Thank you very much.

88
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:27,125
Please take a rest.

89
00:08:29,945 --> 00:08:32,055
You should lie down since the medicine is still working

90
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,668
But....

91
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,937
I'm still a medical student, so of course I'm taking care of you.

92
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:37,461
But.

93
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,844
Follow my advice

94
00:08:39,698 --> 00:08:40,523
I'm sorry.

95
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,990
You received a very honest response from him, but you never heard his name.

96
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:54,250
What were you doing?

97
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:57,515
You can't repay him

98
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,298
I was embarrassed to hear his name.

99
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:07,305
There's no need to be embarrassed to say thank him

100
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:11,563
You are too shy.

101
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,415
When did you come back?

102
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,250
I came back last night on the night train.

103
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:26,602
Did you see your mom?

104
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:29,501
I think you were surprised.

105
00:09:30,673 --> 00:09:32,181
Have you been here for a while?

106
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:35,865
Take good care of your mom.

107
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,547
Thank you very much.

108
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:43,907
What's wrong?

109
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,884
Come in.

110
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:56,063
How was her?

111
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,100
She look fine.
Is her illness serious?

112
00:10:01,092 --> 00:10:06,196
According to the doctor, there are a lot of bad things with her body.

113
00:10:07,225 --> 00:10:12,157
so what are you going to do about it? The hospital costs are ridiculous,

114
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:16,000
and until now, your aunt has been helping out

115
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,212
Sorry for the inconvenience.

116
00:10:19,973 --> 00:10:25,102
If I'm fine, my job is fine.

117
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:29,391
I think it'll be okay without your mother.

118
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,316
Even if I want to help somehow,

119
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:34,290
Last night I thought about various things.

120
00:10:35,455 --> 00:10:37,213
About the house

121
00:10:37,923 --> 00:10:40,923
If your mother is hospitalized for a long time

122
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:46,087
How about cutting back on that economy?
How about firing the maid?

123
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:51,314
I don't think it's worth the money to pay them.

124
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:59,228
I was against you going to school in Tokyo.

125
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,626
Your Mom understood, but think about it—like mother, like child;

126
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,196
If you were a Maiko,

127
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,861
I'd take care of you

128
00:11:11,578 --> 00:11:13,712
Think about that.

129
00:11:14,353 --> 00:11:17,360
I can say that this obi suits that kimono.

130
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:23,360
If you say something like that,I sing like this

131
00:11:27,861 --> 00:11:29,658
My throat hurts.

132
00:11:29,683 --> 00:11:31,736
Is someone making a strange noise?

133
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,213
I felt bad.

134
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:36,346
Why you're here?

135
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:37,908
I'm here to pay my bill.

136
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,634
Thank you very much.

137
00:11:40,955 --> 00:11:41,736
Have a seat.

138
00:11:41,761 --> 00:11:42,955
I'm leaving.

139
00:11:43,049 --> 00:11:44,713
Think about that.

140
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:48,080
Please.

141
00:11:52,924 --> 00:11:53,689
Who's her?

142
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,611
Satogiku's daughter.

143
00:11:57,298 --> 00:12:00,298
Isn't she a nice girl?

144
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:08,900
Is she your sister?

145
00:12:09,596 --> 00:12:11,564
She's my daughter.

146
00:12:13,368 --> 00:12:16,368
I didn't know there was such a big daughter.

147
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,049
Take care.

148
00:12:44,446 --> 00:12:46,455
Mom.

149
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:50,674
I see.

150
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:02,145
Why did they let her get this bad?

151
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,056
People in that kind of society tend to push themselves without realizing it

152
00:13:06,261 --> 00:13:07,414
Does she have cirrhosis?

153
00:13:08,126 --> 00:13:10,876
That's a possibility, so we're taking x-rays to investigate.

154
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:12,767
If it's a cancer?.

155
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:14,510
there's no hope at all.

156
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,494
Her daughter knows that?

157
00:13:17,846 --> 00:13:18,939
Nobody knows about it yet.

158
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,985
How're you?

159
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:40,033
Thank you very much.

160
00:13:40,697 --> 00:13:45,267
You took care of my daughter on the train.

161
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,432
I want to thank you a lot.

162
00:13:50,135 --> 00:13:54,455
She's out right now but will be back soon.

163
00:13:55,344 --> 00:14:01,463
She received your kind help.
But she didn't ask your name. Sorry.

164
00:14:01,736 --> 00:14:03,096
Don't worry.

165
00:14:04,627 --> 00:14:05,908
Please.

166
00:14:19,728 --> 00:14:21,400
I apologize for that earlier.

167
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:23,923
My mother said she wanted to meet you and express her gratitude

168
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:25,041
I just visited her.

169
00:14:25,143 --> 00:14:26,283
Oh really?

170
00:14:26,415 --> 00:14:29,155
She was so politely thanked that I ended up feeling troubled.

171
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,355
How is my mother's condition?

172
00:14:57,329 --> 00:14:59,689
I don't really understand well

173
00:14:59,841 --> 00:15:01,314
but I don't think there's anything to worry about

174
00:15:01,377 --> 00:15:02,619
I see.

175
00:15:03,588 --> 00:15:08,510
I was relieved to hear that.

176
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:16,712
What a nice mother she is

177
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:23,459
How long will you be staying in Kyoto?

178
00:15:24,877 --> 00:15:26,205
I have school

179
00:15:26,757 --> 00:15:28,181
so I can't stay for too long

180
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:32,064
You want to go to music college, right?

181
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:36,494
Did my mother even tell you about that?

182
00:15:39,093 --> 00:15:42,610
but I might have to give up on that now

183
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,838
Why?

184
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:53,785
Are you just your mother and your family?

185
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:01,494
Don't worry.

186
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:09,945
I don't really understand much about music

187
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,533
The other day in Tokyo, I was so moved to watch a concert.

188
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,830
It was amazing.

189
00:16:13,862 --> 00:16:14,900
Were you there too?

190
00:16:14,925 --> 00:16:16,411
We might meet.

191
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,416
I was on the third floor.

192
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:18,736
Me too.

193
00:16:18,776 --> 00:16:19,646
but speaking of which

194
00:16:20,152 --> 00:16:23,939
There was a female student next to me who sighed at that time.
Was she you?

195
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,182
Really?

196
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:31,283
The man next to me at the time was snoring the whole time.

197
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:32,666
I remember it well.

198
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:35,611
Well, he might have been me.

199
00:16:54,939 --> 00:16:58,197
Will my illness get better?

200
00:16:58,836 --> 00:17:01,102
I'll do my best with what I can,

201
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,304
but I think it's ultimately a matter of time

202
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,554
What do you mean?

203
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:08,637
It would be nice if she will alive for six months.

204
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:12,644
I feel sorry about her.

205
00:17:20,017 --> 00:17:21,570
Is that so?

206
00:17:23,244 --> 00:17:24,291
I see.

207
00:17:25,441 --> 00:17:28,441
It's quite lively now.

208
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,000
She was talking interesting.

209
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,389
I came a little too late.

210
00:17:39,313 --> 00:17:41,837
Even though you are always busy,

211
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:44,868
I'm glad you visit me.

212
00:17:44,893 --> 00:17:47,152
Your complexion has improved.

213
00:17:47,953 --> 00:17:49,173
I'm glad

214
00:17:49,828 --> 00:17:52,090
As expected, Tome is back so you get better.

215
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,291
Thank you very much.

216
00:17:54,981 --> 00:17:58,776
Let me know if you need something.

217
00:17:59,074 --> 00:18:00,087
Thank you very much.

218
00:18:01,386 --> 00:18:07,668
She has really done well, so I am not inconvenienced.

219
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,370
Tome,you're great.

220
00:18:12,222 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm going to buy you a reward.

221
00:18:14,611 --> 00:18:15,518
that would make me happy

222
00:18:15,648 --> 00:18:17,208
I wonder what I want.

223
00:18:17,579 --> 00:18:18,339
Tome.

224
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:20,499
What do you want?

225
00:18:25,974 --> 00:18:27,001
Wanna have lunch?

226
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:29,798
Let's have a lunch with me as a reward,

227
00:18:31,717 --> 00:18:34,111
I'll get ready.

228
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,879
It's better to wear nice clothes.

229
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:41,515
And get your hair done.

230
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:41,999
Yes.

231
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:50,563
It must look beautiful from here on the day of Daimonji

232
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,920
Next time, let's take Mom to see it!

233
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:06,611
Tome.

234
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:10,417
What will you do if Mom's illness doesn't get better?

235
00:19:12,927 --> 00:19:17,402
According to the doctor,her liver is really bad.

236
00:19:17,861 --> 00:19:18,768
Her liver?

237
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:20,985
Mom's cancer?

238
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:21,872
No no.

239
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,149
If she has cancer, she won't live six months.

240
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,351
She'll get better?

241
00:19:27,176 --> 00:19:31,049
Even if she recover, she won't be able to go out.

242
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:37,114
You shouldn't let your mother know about this.

243
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,436
Why don't you become Maiko?

244
00:19:49,402 --> 00:19:53,545
In the end, making your mother feel at ease and emotionally supported means you have to work

245
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,841
If you want to work, how about becoming a maiko?

246
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,669
You're good at both singing and dancing

247
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,991
Your mother was really looking forward to that

248
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:09,146
I know you have to think about it.

249
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:12,343
But it's okay to take your time to think about it

250
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:14,920
Don't push yourself.

251
00:20:15,476 --> 00:20:19,241
I will come up with various ideas for you, understood?

252
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:23,345
Wanna have a tea? No?

253
00:20:24,198 --> 00:20:25,091
Let's go.

254
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:36,358
Thank you very much.

255
00:20:38,002 --> 00:20:39,342
Hello?

256
00:20:39,482 --> 00:20:40,649
It's been ages.

257
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:41,527
See you.

258
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:42,412
Who's her?

259
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,349
She's Gion's tea house madam.

260
00:20:46,305 --> 00:20:47,871
I need to make a phone call.

261
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,066
Hello, I'm Eiji.

262
00:20:58,616 --> 00:20:59,553
Yoko?

263
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,290
I have an internship tomorrow

264
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:03,964
I absolutely have to be in Tokyo tonight.

265
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,532
I have preparations to make, so I'm going home

266
00:21:07,774 --> 00:21:10,265
Well then, please take care of Keisuke.

267
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:14,766
From Yoko?

268
00:21:15,085 --> 00:21:15,491
Yes.

269
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:17,054
Why did you turn down?

270
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,482
She'll take me to the station tonight.

271
00:21:39,707 --> 00:21:40,652
Yes.

272
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:44,244
How's your mom?

273
00:21:44,727 --> 00:21:46,226
Yes, Mom is sleeping right now.

274
00:21:46,746 --> 00:21:47,467
Excuse me.

275
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,213
I'm heading to Tokyo.

276
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:11,423
I don't have much time left,

277
00:22:12,765 --> 00:22:14,662
but I was worried about you.

278
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,109
so I'm sorry.

279
00:22:20,598 --> 00:22:22,548
Make sure not to lose hope for your mother.

280
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,492
You heard it from Aunts, right?

281
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,434
She still has a hope.

282
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:30,997
you need to make sure she gets as much nutrition as possible through your efforts

283
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:37,414
In the case of liver cancer, she has to be careful about the body's weakness caused by loss of appetite

284
00:22:38,803 --> 00:22:41,416
She has cancer as I thought?

285
00:22:42,121 --> 00:22:44,066
You didn't know that?

286
00:22:48,433 --> 00:22:49,342
Tomeko.

287
00:22:51,851 --> 00:22:54,631
That's fine.
I'll know it later.

288
00:22:56,012 --> 00:22:59,012
It's better to find out sooner.

289
00:23:03,989 --> 00:23:06,334
Miss Makihara is pick up you.

290
00:23:06,747 --> 00:23:07,613
I'll be there soon.

291
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:10,878
It's time for the train,right?

292
00:23:10,903 --> 00:23:12,381
Please go.

293
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:18,382
I've asked my father about your mother, and I will return after I graduate,

294
00:23:18,755 --> 00:23:20,114
so I will do my best to help as much as I can

295
00:23:21,495 --> 00:23:23,005
You have been doing your best without being pushed down

296
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:25,820
See you then.

297
00:23:38,434 --> 00:23:40,022
Take care.

298
00:24:49,517 --> 00:24:53,407
What are you doing?
Is your mom's ok?

299
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,732
Aunt.

300
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:08,323
I'll become Maiko.

301
00:25:08,492 --> 00:25:08,886
What?

302
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:13,744
That's good.

303
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:17,101
You have made up your mind well.

304
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,860
So, Did your mom agree?

305
00:25:22,258 --> 00:25:24,173
I don't think she will agree.

306
00:25:24,424 --> 00:25:26,882
Have you not told your mom yet?

307
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:28,723
I see.

308
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,143
if that's how you feel,

309
00:25:31,449 --> 00:25:34,063
I'll tell her again, so that's good

310
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:37,404
That's good,that's good.

311
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:38,179
Tome.

312
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:41,585
I am relieved.

313
00:25:44,827 --> 00:25:47,016
You'll become nice geisha.

314
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:49,787
Taking your mom's name,

315
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:53,379
you'll go to the second generation Satogiku.

316
00:25:53,537 --> 00:25:57,101
You might be much prettier than when your mom was Maiko

317
00:25:58,791 --> 00:26:00,099
Please stand up a bit

318
00:26:05,262 --> 00:26:06,621
Look sideways.

319
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,945
Look at me.

320
00:26:19,698 --> 00:26:20,825
You look so nice.

321
00:26:21,315 --> 00:26:24,307
If I show you to your mom, she will probably be happy

322
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:29,224
she's angry, she won't be happy

323
00:26:29,667 --> 00:26:30,916
I don't think so.

324
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:34,175
Go to the hospital as it is.

325
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,678
Hey anyone there?

326
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:39,888
Oh you are there?

327
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,198
Are you ok?

328
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:41,854
Mom.

329
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,557
Can you walk?

330
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:46,813
Are you ok?

331
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,693
You came back well.

332
00:26:49,834 --> 00:26:54,437
I tried to stop her, but she wanted to see her daughter's first job.

333
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,738
Parents love their daughters after all.

334
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:03,526
I’m worried about various things,.

335
00:27:06,073 --> 00:27:10,693
Please look after Tomeko.

336
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,762
I'll do my best.

337
00:27:23,893 --> 00:27:24,660
Tome.

338
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:29,935
I'm proud of you.

339
00:27:31,362 --> 00:27:33,942
Be nice Geisha.

340
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:36,705
Mom.

341
00:27:42,014 --> 00:27:43,501
Don't cry.

342
00:27:46,602 --> 00:27:50,437
it will ruin your face.

343
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:16,570
I wanted to see how you dress geisha outfit.

344
00:28:22,176 --> 00:28:27,506
It's not embarrassing no matter where you go

345
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,427
Please go.

346
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,839
Mom, so I'm off now

347
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,344
Be careful.

348
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:04,587
Please take care of her.

349
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:08,556
Don't worry, Leave it to me.

350
00:29:08,813 --> 00:29:11,126
so let's go.

351
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,644
I'm going.

352
00:29:27,714 --> 00:29:29,401
Take care.

353
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:32,091
I'm going.

354
00:29:32,129 --> 00:29:35,515
You have to be in the bed.

355
00:31:17,422 --> 00:31:18,462
Oh Geisha girl.

356
00:31:18,769 --> 00:31:20,142
She's nice.

357
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,123
I want your signature.

358
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:28,970
I want your signature.

359
00:31:29,658 --> 00:31:31,111
Don't push me.

360
00:31:31,136 --> 00:31:33,309
I've been waiting about an hour.

361
00:31:33,524 --> 00:31:34,684
I’m sorry.

362
00:31:36,131 --> 00:31:38,353
president ,I finally bring her here.

363
00:31:38,549 --> 00:31:39,400
Good evening

364
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:42,546
You go there.

365
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,430
Sis.

366
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:44,928
Hurry up.

367
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:46,174
What's the hell?

368
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:51,460
You're too popular these days.

369
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,303
Have a drink.

370
00:31:54,023 --> 00:31:55,489
Have a drink.

371
00:31:56,177 --> 00:31:57,324
I'll have it little.

372
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,898
Let's drink a lot.

373
00:32:06,488 --> 00:32:07,588
Have a drink more.

374
00:32:08,085 --> 00:32:09,632
I can't drink this anymore.

375
00:32:10,076 --> 00:32:11,264
I see.

376
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:20,659
You wanted to go to music college, didn't you?

377
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,277
How did you know?

378
00:32:29,143 --> 00:32:32,276
Do you want me to support you to go to the college?

379
00:32:32,609 --> 00:32:33,882
Thanks.

380
00:32:34,976 --> 00:32:37,786
Instead, scary things happen, don't they?

381
00:32:37,936 --> 00:32:40,722
You're so mean.

382
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,266
He has no ulterior motive.

383
00:32:44,066 --> 00:32:46,137
He is kind man.

384
00:32:46,285 --> 00:32:47,152
Are you sure?

385
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:48,233
Shut up!

386
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,226
I'm right?

387
00:32:52,843 --> 00:32:55,843
Let me know if you wanna go to the college.

388
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:59,686
I was really hoping for something, but I have completely given up.

389
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,732
Don't worry about me.

390
00:33:03,008 --> 00:33:05,270
but instead, let's play around, shall we?

391
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:08,432
Do you know about this?

392
00:33:08,993 --> 00:33:11,993
10....10 game.

393
00:33:12,042 --> 00:33:13,008
What's the hell?

394
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,974
Say it slowly.

395
00:33:15,629 --> 00:33:19,015
10....10 game.

396
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:21,197
10....?

397
00:33:22,536 --> 00:33:23,703
What's the hell?

398
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,221
I'll teach you.

399
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,967
Look at me.

400
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,610
10....10.

401
00:33:30,972 --> 00:33:31,652
You get it?

402
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:32,938
That word?

403
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:37,310
Word like this.

404
00:33:38,747 --> 00:33:39,680
Yeah.

405
00:33:41,817 --> 00:33:43,044
Like this.

406
00:33:46,531 --> 00:33:48,831
You love me?

407
00:33:51,756 --> 00:33:54,089
president, This is very nice.

408
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:58,935
She's telling her feelings inside

409
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:01,031
Don't say anything inappropriate.

410
00:34:01,877 --> 00:34:04,224
Yamazaki-san is like a dragonfly in a thunderstorm

411
00:34:04,249 --> 00:34:05,442
What do you mean?

412
00:34:06,892 --> 00:34:07,432
What?

413
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:10,455
The dragonfly is shaped

414
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:12,659
Thunder is like this.

415
00:34:12,897 --> 00:34:14,164
It means I hate you.

416
00:34:15,902 --> 00:34:16,942
I see.

417
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,121
Want to know your nickname?

418
00:34:19,146 --> 00:34:20,275
Stop it....

419
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,250
Tell me.

420
00:34:22,523 --> 00:34:23,396
No fists.

421
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,549
No fists?

422
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:28,157
What if there is no rock-paper-scissors goo

423
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:29,597
paper-scissors only.

424
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:31,003
It means you are asshole.

425
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:32,831
You're so mean.

426
00:34:32,856 --> 00:34:34,659
Satoi named it.

427
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:37,874
She's very smart.

428
00:34:39,198 --> 00:34:40,018
How about me?

429
00:34:40,451 --> 00:34:42,731
You are a fluorescent light.

430
00:34:43,674 --> 00:34:45,434
I am a fluorescent light.

431
00:34:45,753 --> 00:34:47,439
Don't tell him the reason.

432
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:52,417
I don't understand it unless I think about it carefully.

433
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:55,784
You said the answer yourself

434
00:34:55,809 --> 00:34:56,495
Who?

435
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,183
You.

436
00:34:57,308 --> 00:34:58,300
Me?

437
00:35:09,253 --> 00:35:10,144
What's wrong?

438
00:35:17,112 --> 00:35:19,120
I'm going to turn the lights on now so please take a good look.

439
00:35:22,784 --> 00:35:23,706
Ready?

440
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,698
I see.
It's Half dark.

441
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:31,792
You are stupid.

442
00:35:32,312 --> 00:35:33,765
Forgive me....

443
00:35:34,003 --> 00:35:36,683
Don't make fun of me.

444
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,417
For Tomiko.

445
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,112
Thank you for your work.

446
00:35:57,964 --> 00:35:59,089
Letter?

447
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:02,323
From a young doctor in Tokyo

448
00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:16,490
I received your letter,Tomeko.

449
00:36:23,698 --> 00:36:24,628
Thank you.

450
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,026
I read your letter.

451
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I'm glad to hear that your mother's condition has improved

452
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:49,909
I can't say how much your love is more effective
for your mother than medicine right now

453
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,040
I finally finished writing my graduation thesis and submitted it to the school

454
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,713
And I went to listen to Beethoven's Symphony No. 6 for the first time in a while

455
00:37:00,064 --> 00:37:03,651
How much fun would it be if you were here with me?

456
00:37:03,964 --> 00:37:05,196
I'm a bit disappointed

457
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,837
but when I return to Kyoto, there are
definitely things I want to talk to you about

458
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:15,433
I'm sure you'll be happy to hear about it too

459
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:38,048
The letter is from a young doctor at the hospital,right?

460
00:37:39,555 --> 00:37:43,094
He is very worried about you

461
00:37:45,783 --> 00:37:50,314
He's kind.
Please say thank you to him.

462
00:37:55,828 --> 00:37:58,985
Does he know that you are a geisha?

463
00:38:00,642 --> 00:38:03,626
I only told him that I had dropped out of school.

464
00:38:05,427 --> 00:38:07,673
I think he's surprised.

465
00:38:30,251 --> 00:38:37,298
Do you know what's making noise next door?

466
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:44,564
Yuhi?

467
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:48,718
That's right,

468
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:52,726
This is my favourite song.

469
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:57,289
Do you remember me singing?

470
00:38:57,876 --> 00:38:58,540
Yes.

471
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:04,009
I saw you singing when I was just a kid.

472
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:07,620
Tears were starting to well up.

473
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:17,642
It was beautiful! I also thought that I wanted to try it once I grew up, and I was watching it with all my might

474
00:39:24,168 --> 00:39:27,168
This song is great every time I hear it.

475
00:39:39,861 --> 00:39:41,431
Go home safe.

476
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,361
Thanks.

477
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,345
Take care.

478
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:47,376
Thanks.

479
00:39:48,228 --> 00:39:49,970
See you.

480
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,851
See you then.

481
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,037
Take care.

482
00:40:30,669 --> 00:40:33,280
I just visited your home and saw your mother.

483
00:40:39,324 --> 00:40:40,930
I heard that you were discharged from the hospital

484
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:43,659
I was wondering what you needed afterward

485
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,540
Thank you for going out of your way.

486
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:52,566
Are you alright?

487
00:40:53,377 --> 00:40:54,328
Satogiku?

488
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:19,103
Is her condition worse than before?

489
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,306
It seems like she's gradually getting weaker

490
00:41:26,137 --> 00:41:31,157
In front of me,she pretend to be lively on purpose,

491
00:41:32,267 --> 00:41:34,290
so I act like I don't notice

492
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,999
Congratulations on your graduation!

493
00:42:03,423 --> 00:42:06,595
You have changed.

494
00:42:07,682 --> 00:42:10,228
Somehow, you all seem like different people to me.

495
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:12,494
I didn't like this outfit at first either.

496
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,821
But I've completely gotten used to it now

497
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:18,390
After all, a frog's child is a frog.

498
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,017
I never imagined you would become a Geisha.

499
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,110
Why didn't you let me know?

500
00:42:26,681 --> 00:42:27,416
Well..

501
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:28,712
But

502
00:42:28,982 --> 00:42:31,982
I'm not in a position to go to school

503
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:35,296
If I don't work, neither of us can survive

504
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:38,079
It must be tough

505
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:40,776
There is no job that isn't hard, right?

506
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,938
But when I see you like this, dressed as Maiko,

507
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,087
it somehow feels like my heart is being squeezed

508
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,431
Why is that?

509
00:42:53,736 --> 00:42:55,681
Why are you so interested in me?

510
00:42:58,729 --> 00:42:59,290
Is that bad?

511
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,634
Tome.

512
00:43:42,931 --> 00:43:46,938
Can we meet again another day?

513
00:43:48,259 --> 00:43:49,282
It would be fine during the day?

514
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:13,392
Eiji.

515
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,111
Did you think I'd come dressed as a geisha?

516
00:44:23,384 --> 00:44:23,791
Yes.

517
00:44:25,869 --> 00:44:26,564
Yeah

518
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:31,626
I felt bad for you if I came in my Geisha form.

519
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:35,360
Washing this hair is a hassle.
it's all greasy, right?

520
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,540
How about this?
 Doesn't it look like the Tomoko that Eri-san knows?

521
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:44,845
It feels like it's been a while, and dressing like this makes me feel like I've really returned to being a student

522
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:22,532
That's Gion over there.
It's small.

523
00:45:23,286 --> 00:45:26,286
I thought about how we cried and laughed every day in a place like that

524
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:27,649
It's ridiculous to think that way

525
00:45:27,806 --> 00:45:28,837
You think so?

526
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:35,235
That's why it's sometimes necessary for us to view our lives from a different perspective

527
00:45:39,283 --> 00:45:40,330
Have a seat.

528
00:45:48,247 --> 00:45:51,750
Do you intend to continue this job forever?

529
00:45:53,363 --> 00:45:55,415
I won't do this job when I get older.

530
00:45:57,587 --> 00:46:03,556
Did you read my letter?

531
00:46:07,837 --> 00:46:12,407
Of course, but I'm not thinking about marriage.

532
00:46:13,369 --> 00:46:14,564
Not right now

533
00:46:18,201 --> 00:46:23,656
It might be a long way off, but I want to make a promise

534
00:46:25,276 --> 00:46:29,266
I was really happy when I read your letter.

535
00:46:31,298 --> 00:46:33,720
But aren't you engaged?

536
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:36,400
engaged?

537
00:46:37,909 --> 00:46:40,909
A woman who was driving you around.

538
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:43,080
Oh her.

539
00:46:45,799 --> 00:46:48,243
 Our fathers are friends

540
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:52,446
We've been close since childhood, but not engagement?

541
00:46:53,095 --> 00:46:53,994
Really?

542
00:46:56,244 --> 00:46:57,244
Will you make a promise with me?

543
00:46:58,806 --> 00:47:00,205
Would you mind if I were a Geisha?

544
00:47:00,364 --> 00:47:02,220
It doesn't matter if you're a maiko or a student;

545
00:47:02,707 --> 00:47:04,274
my feelings won't change

546
00:47:05,759 --> 00:47:09,197
But I have debts

547
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:14,009
I intend to somehow repay.

548
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,353
As long as you hold it together

549
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:21,688
Geisha is also a great job.

550
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:30,892
I accept your offer.

551
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,587
It hurts.

552
00:47:53,666 --> 00:47:54,447
Eiji.

553
00:47:57,095 --> 00:47:58,181
Are you alright?

554
00:47:59,883 --> 00:48:02,883
Oh you are here.
I just visited your house.

555
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,931
She has just started working so she doesn't know much about it.

556
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:30,650
Is it okay to leave her as she is?

557
00:48:32,054 --> 00:48:38,657
We need her to become a top-notch Geisha.

558
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:43,431
For that, I really think she needs to avoid relying on Edano

559
00:48:44,847 --> 00:48:50,212
I believe Fukutome would be perfect,right?

560
00:48:54,366 --> 00:48:57,366
I am saying this with her future in mind.

561
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,410
I’m saying this for your sake,

562
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:04,899
I want you to have a good rest.

563
00:49:06,023 --> 00:49:08,267
I understand that very well.

564
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:12,978
But I need to her feelings as well.

565
00:49:13,003 --> 00:49:14,212
Well, of course

566
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:17,290
I don't force her.

567
00:49:18,713 --> 00:49:21,713
but Fukutome-san is quite nice.

568
00:49:22,497 --> 00:49:27,367
He paid for all of your hospital bills and her debut.

569
00:49:28,446 --> 00:49:31,009
He's really great.

570
00:49:32,965 --> 00:49:35,595
Fukutome is taking care of us very well.

571
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:39,352
You should repay him.

572
00:49:39,923 --> 00:49:41,134
I'm home.

573
00:49:42,751 --> 00:49:44,244
Thanks for coming.

574
00:49:44,423 --> 00:49:45,705
Welcome back.

575
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:50,540
It's hard for you to tell her that.

576
00:49:51,077 --> 00:49:53,320
Do you want me to ask her?

577
00:49:53,859 --> 00:49:56,859
but you should think it over carefully, okay?

578
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:00,513
Where did you go dressed like that?

579
00:50:01,141 --> 00:50:02,641
Where were you?

580
00:50:03,381 --> 00:50:06,680
Please come back quickly and manage it.

581
00:50:09,868 --> 00:50:11,063
I'm leaving.

582
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:15,328
You should call Fujino.

583
00:50:16,604 --> 00:50:18,476
Take care.

584
00:50:19,063 --> 00:50:19,977
See you.

585
00:50:34,477 --> 00:50:36,145
What brings her here?

586
00:50:36,472 --> 00:50:39,445
She just came to visit

587
00:50:42,830 --> 00:50:46,891
Something good happened to me.

588
00:50:52,055 --> 00:50:53,110
What do you think it is?

589
00:50:55,230 --> 00:51:01,540
Today I met Eiji and make a promise to get married.

590
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:04,986
Make a promise to get married?

591
00:51:10,689 --> 00:51:12,212
That's very difficult

592
00:51:12,431 --> 00:51:13,783
Not now.

593
00:51:14,625 --> 00:51:16,001
it's something far ahead

594
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:21,087
I don't know what the hell you're thinking.

595
00:51:22,642 --> 00:51:24,907
You didn't consult me ​​about anything.

596
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:28,115
I have to go now

597
00:51:30,064 --> 00:51:30,939
Tome.

598
00:51:35,986 --> 00:51:37,048
Hello?

599
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:42,517
You didn't officially get engaged to Yoko,

600
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:46,751
there was an understanding between you two

601
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,149
I've never even thought about such a thing, not once

602
00:51:51,322 --> 00:51:54,603
I think Yoko thinks she's engaged to you.

603
00:51:55,417 --> 00:51:58,938
Eiji, I hadn't talked to you about it yet

604
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:04,673
Actually, I owe a debt of gratitude to Makihara-san for
providing the funds to build this hospital after the war

605
00:52:05,861 --> 00:52:08,861
Of course, I am paying back that money little by little every year

606
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:10,136
If possible, it would be a great relief for me,

607
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,770
at least mentally, if you could marry Yoko.

608
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,087
We won't force you.

609
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,454
However, it seems that you were quite close to Yoko

610
00:52:27,129 --> 00:52:30,129
If my relationship with Yoko is perceived that way,

611
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,100
I feel responsible towards her

612
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:40,618
But I don't consider her as a marriage candidate.

613
00:52:43,773 --> 00:52:47,532
I'm sorry, but please let me choose my own marriage partner

614
00:52:51,653 --> 00:52:54,549
What on earth my mom going to do?

615
00:52:54,712 --> 00:52:57,439
She depends on you alone.

616
00:52:58,071 --> 00:53:01,563
I think if you understand that feeling, she would gladly agree

617
00:53:02,343 --> 00:53:05,392
But you'll have to depend on someone someday.

618
00:53:06,095 --> 00:53:08,298
If that's the case, wouldn't it be better to do it a little earlier?

619
00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:13,739
But he must be quite an eccentric person

620
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:15,993
Who on earth is he?

621
00:53:16,119 --> 00:53:16,744
Musa.

622
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,626
I understand it's either the fluorescent light.

623
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:24,712
He is the president of a shipbuilding company.

624
00:53:25,228 --> 00:53:26,220
I know.

625
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:29,936
I'll discuss it with mom and think about it.

626
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:30,816
I see, I see,

627
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:32,356
then that's good

628
00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,906
Oh, and there's something I want to show you.

629
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,017
Just wait a moment.

630
00:53:46,595 --> 00:53:49,134
Take a look at this.

631
00:53:50,251 --> 00:53:52,775
it's something mom's Testimonials.

632
00:53:53,783 --> 00:53:54,564
Testimonials?

633
00:53:57,522 --> 00:54:00,524
Are the customers waiting?

634
00:54:02,587 --> 00:54:04,072
I'll take a look it later.

635
00:54:04,104 --> 00:54:05,837
Anytime.

636
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:40,048
Good evening!

637
00:54:41,157 --> 00:54:42,422
Hello?

638
00:54:53,517 --> 00:54:55,416
Are you Satogiku?

639
00:54:55,533 --> 00:54:56,228
Yes.

640
00:54:56,853 --> 00:54:57,673
Come in.

641
00:55:11,033 --> 00:55:13,392
Thank you for coming.

642
00:55:14,017 --> 00:55:16,876
My sister wants to talk to you

643
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,118
I'll go over there

644
00:55:19,369 --> 00:55:21,306
Please stay here.

645
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:31,267
I have been getting close with Eiji-san.
Since I was a child.

646
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:36,450
So if you are friends with Eri,

647
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:38,806
I would like to be friend too

648
00:55:39,822 --> 00:55:40,642
Friend?

649
00:55:44,323 --> 00:55:45,868
Thank you.

650
00:55:46,745 --> 00:55:49,745
But am I really can't be your friend.

651
00:55:52,501 --> 00:55:53,392
Why not?

652
00:56:06,964 --> 00:56:12,884
I don't really know what kind of relationship you and Eiji have,

653
00:56:13,736 --> 00:56:15,751
but if it's okay, please tell me

654
00:56:16,870 --> 00:56:19,870
Please feel free to ask Eiji

655
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:23,223
Right.

656
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:30,532
Well, that's ok, but
can I ask just one thing?

657
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:35,267
What do you think of Eri?

658
00:56:40,064 --> 00:56:41,041
I love him.

659
00:56:47,681 --> 00:56:49,251
Are you planning to get married?

660
00:56:53,586 --> 00:56:55,431
I love him too

661
00:56:55,456 --> 00:56:56,938
I also want to get married.

662
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:10,204
I've been wondering what kind of person you are, but you're a nice person

663
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,900
If you were a bad person, I wouldn't even get close to you, Eiji

664
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,438
I'm starting to like you.

665
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:25,657
I want to be friends, but that's separate from how I feel about Eiji

666
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:30,329
I don't want to give up for your sake

667
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:34,370
Is it okay if you don't hold back with me.

668
00:57:38,618 --> 00:57:42,681
From now on, let's have a beautiful relationship with each other

669
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,761
No hard feelings no matter who wins.

670
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,291
What happened?
Let's shake hands.

671
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:04,181
I guess that you met her and wanted to clarify your position by meeting,

672
00:58:05,490 --> 00:58:07,926
but I don't think it was very effective

673
00:58:08,294 --> 00:58:11,563
I can't explain my feelings to you.

674
00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:15,942
No....

675
00:58:21,637 --> 00:58:27,192
It must be a big deal that she came to see you.

676
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:32,180
She really likes Eiji.

677
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:39,114
I know you like him too.

678
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:48,239
She's a rich girl who's known him since he was a child.

679
00:58:49,920 --> 00:59:00,723
I don't know what's in his future, whether she's with you or not with her.

680
00:59:02,301 --> 00:59:05,590
I think about it a lot.

681
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:09,106
Don't say like that.

682
00:59:31,198 --> 00:59:32,270
Tome-chan

683
00:59:43,879 --> 00:59:48,980
Your mother? You might think that's an old-fashioned thing to say, but...

684
00:59:51,152 --> 00:59:56,363
I believe that human emotions haven't changed from the past to the present, and for the sake of happiness

685
01:00:00,238 --> 01:00:11,751
For Eiji's happiness. sometimes you
have to accept what you can't give up

686
01:00:13,436 --> 01:00:14,676
I can't.

687
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:25,811
You grew up in Honmachi

688
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:31,581
I am sure you understand my intentions.

689
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:36,970
Geisha have their own way.

690
01:00:39,841 --> 01:00:43,532
It's painful and sadness.

691
01:00:46,606 --> 01:00:50,295
It is the geisha who put up with it.

692
01:00:51,969 --> 01:00:56,090
That's what a geisha is.

693
01:00:59,494 --> 01:01:00,487
Mom.

694
01:01:03,791 --> 01:01:07,330
Please understand me.

695
01:01:09,627 --> 01:01:11,432
Please give up on him.

696
01:01:19,518 --> 01:01:22,518
I'm glad you gave up on him.

697
01:01:24,229 --> 01:01:32,276
In return, I will definitely decline Fukudome's offer.

698
01:01:33,877 --> 01:01:36,877
I feel sorry for you.

699
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,807
You're still child.

700
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:52,431
Mom.

701
01:02:18,017 --> 01:02:21,502
From your perspective, she still look like a child

702
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,716
But now she is a fine Geisha.

703
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:29,986
The times are different from the past, right?
I will not make unreasonable demands.

704
01:02:30,860 --> 01:02:34,908
How will you repay your debt to Fukudome?

705
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:44,205
I will sell the property and pay off the debt.

706
01:02:45,746 --> 01:02:48,746
But I don't think it's an easy sell.

707
01:02:49,416 --> 01:02:51,690
If you sell it, you're out of business.

708
01:02:53,573 --> 01:02:55,689
How do I plan to make a living?

709
01:03:11,263 --> 01:03:14,869
Hello,Yes.

710
01:03:17,115 --> 01:03:21,111
I wanna see you.
please come out for just a little while, won't you?

711
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:23,783
Hello?
Hello?

712
01:03:53,994 --> 01:03:55,604
Do not answer the phone.

713
01:03:58,572 --> 01:04:00,174
Do not answer the phone

714
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,861
You know what?

715
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,783
I think about you all too much

716
01:04:18,590 --> 01:04:21,590
In the end, it seems like I've ended up making you all suffer

717
01:04:22,283 --> 01:04:23,072
Sorry.

718
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:27,533
I don't want to deal with anymore

719
01:04:28,769 --> 01:04:30,299
Do as you like.

720
01:04:31,619 --> 01:04:34,158
From now on, I won't talk much about Tome-san.

721
01:04:35,510 --> 01:04:36,572
Sorry.

722
01:05:18,907 --> 01:05:21,189
Are you alright?

723
01:05:22,605 --> 01:05:27,189
Please come here!
Kikue is in toruble.

724
01:05:33,783 --> 01:05:34,612
Hello?

725
01:05:35,002 --> 01:05:38,182
Do not answer the phone.
Say I'm not here.

726
01:05:39,158 --> 01:05:41,525
Really?
Hold on.

727
01:05:43,595 --> 01:05:47,181
Did your mother collapse at Hatsuya?

728
01:05:47,278 --> 01:05:49,134
She wants you to come back right away

729
01:05:51,682 --> 01:05:53,143
Hello?

730
01:05:54,164 --> 01:05:55,369
She's going.

731
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:12,721
I’m sorry.

732
01:06:14,295 --> 01:06:18,845
You must be very tired
She seems to be sleeping well

733
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:21,174
Take a little break.

734
01:06:22,087 --> 01:06:24,213
Please rest.

735
01:06:28,143 --> 01:06:30,518
I'm in the room, so if you need something,let me know.

736
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:10,728
Mom, mom.

737
01:07:19,447 --> 01:07:20,299
Tome.

738
01:07:24,854 --> 01:07:27,104
mom, are you feeling unwell?

739
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,478
Should I call doctor?

740
01:07:32,979 --> 01:07:33,924
Tome.

741
01:07:36,823 --> 01:07:38,588
Stay here.

742
01:07:42,229 --> 01:07:44,651
Stay strong.

743
01:07:49,252 --> 01:07:50,408
Tome.

744
01:07:53,388 --> 01:07:56,388
I tell you.

745
01:08:00,482 --> 01:08:04,994
I told you to give up on Eiji.

746
01:08:07,822 --> 01:08:08,955
I will cancel it

747
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:12,252
Mom.

748
01:08:12,794 --> 01:08:15,794
What Did You Say?
Say it again.

749
01:08:18,221 --> 01:08:25,065
I told you to give up on Eiji.
I will cancel it

750
01:08:26,490 --> 01:08:29,490
Do as you like!

751
01:08:30,036 --> 01:08:32,150
Mom, is that true?

752
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:49,947
When I die, you should quit being a geisha and be with Eiji.

753
01:08:50,291 --> 01:08:53,627
I don't want you to die.

754
01:08:54,940 --> 01:08:57,033
Don't worry.

755
01:09:04,782 --> 01:09:14,645
I want to do many things to you.

756
01:09:18,174 --> 01:09:22,526
I couldn't do anything for you.

757
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:32,072
If I could always do it for you, I wouldn't have to worry

758
01:09:32,618 --> 01:09:35,618
You shouldn't say things like that!

759
01:09:50,377 --> 01:09:51,416
Tome.

760
01:09:53,630 --> 01:09:58,353
Who is playing the shamisen?

761
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:06,385
Yuki?

762
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,831
I like this music.

763
01:10:17,462 --> 01:10:21,705
Please stay strong.
I can't hear anything

764
01:10:24,065 --> 01:10:25,705
What a nice.

765
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:31,972
Who is playing this beautiful piece?

766
01:10:32,222 --> 01:10:34,573
Please stay strong.

767
01:10:34,998 --> 01:10:37,229
I'll call doctor.

768
01:10:50,197 --> 01:10:53,752
Mom!
Mom!

769
01:10:59,080 --> 01:10:59,987
Mom!

770
01:11:00,653 --> 01:11:04,994
Mom, Please don't die.

771
01:11:08,393 --> 01:11:09,518
Mom!

772
01:11:12,307 --> 01:11:13,635
Mom!

773
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:43,259
Ume-chan is here too.

774
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:56,455
Thank you for coming.

775
01:11:56,877 --> 01:11:59,127
I'm glad you are here.

776
01:11:59,688 --> 01:12:02,688
Today is her birthday.

777
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,525
Excuse me.

778
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:17,111
You should cheer up and do your best.
I'll support you.

779
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:18,596
Thank you very much.

780
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:19,971
Excuse me.

781
01:12:19,996 --> 01:12:21,612
Thank you for coming.

782
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:38,713
Welcome back.

783
01:12:40,357 --> 01:12:42,400
I'm starving.

784
01:12:42,854 --> 01:12:44,205
Tomoe wants to eat sushi.

785
01:12:45,210 --> 01:12:48,080
Prepare those meals.

786
01:12:49,605 --> 01:12:52,314
Tome-san is lonely now that she is alone

787
01:12:53,764 --> 01:12:55,470
What are you going to do from now on?

788
01:13:00,041 --> 01:13:02,744
I've been resting for a long time.

789
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:03,876
I'm going to work from tomorrow.

790
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:06,938
Yes.
You feel better when you work.

791
01:13:07,205 --> 01:13:08,876
You have to pay back Fukudome's debt.

792
01:13:09,623 --> 01:13:13,033
You can't just ignore the fact that everyone helped with the funeral expenses.

793
01:13:13,619 --> 01:13:16,040
You have to work hard.

794
01:13:16,970 --> 01:13:19,142
Oh yes.

795
01:13:24,677 --> 01:13:31,002
This is because Mr. Fukudome was worried about you and prepared the money for you.

796
01:13:31,862 --> 01:13:32,487
Take it.

797
01:13:35,393 --> 01:13:38,393
What happened?
Take it.

798
01:13:40,549 --> 01:13:42,033
I appreciate his feelings, but I can't accept this.

799
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:49,850
You wouldn't be able to manage without someone's help if you want to be a fine Geisha.

800
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:52,523
I'll thank Fukutome-san
and then receive it.

801
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:57,194
That's a good decision.

802
01:13:59,270 --> 01:14:00,508
You know what?

803
01:14:01,427 --> 01:14:02,694
I have no relatives.

804
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:05,979
When Tomoe-chan was born into a world,

805
01:14:06,003 --> 01:14:12,193
I asked her to adopt you as my adopted daughter.

806
01:14:13,542 --> 01:14:17,096
I you have the ability to do other work,

807
01:14:17,610 --> 01:14:19,700
I want to let you quit even now,

808
01:14:20,436 --> 01:14:24,382
but it seems that someone raised in this society

809
01:14:24,742 --> 01:14:27,953
It's hard to get a normal job.

810
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,010
I am also doing her best to support you

811
01:14:32,650 --> 01:14:36,848
You too will become a wonderful geisha, understood?

812
01:15:22,810 --> 01:15:24,169
Where did she go?

813
01:15:24,194 --> 01:15:25,302
She is on the second floor

814
01:15:25,513 --> 01:15:26,748
Let me go there.

815
01:15:29,677 --> 01:15:32,021
What are you doing?

816
01:15:32,669 --> 01:15:34,841
Is that Love letter?

817
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,045
Our president is happy

818
01:15:39,419 --> 01:15:42,293
He's been restless since this morning at the company

819
01:15:42,926 --> 01:15:45,969
He was busy, so I came first.

820
01:15:46,916 --> 01:15:49,951
around 5 o'clock the president will be here, so please take care of it.

821
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:54,769
Satogiku.

822
01:15:55,706 --> 01:15:58,473
It took a lot for me to get to this point.

823
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:02,209
I'm counting on you.
See you then.

824
01:17:23,840 --> 01:17:26,840
Hello, Is that Takatsugi hospital?

825
01:17:26,932 --> 01:17:31,582
Is Mr. Eiji there?
This is Itami.

826
01:17:34,666 --> 01:17:37,078
I see, thank you very much.

827
01:17:57,695 --> 01:17:59,961
Hello, is that Takatsugi? Is Mr

828
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:01,832
Is Mr. Eiji there?

829
01:18:04,688 --> 01:18:06,741
I also tried calling the hospital.

830
01:18:09,205 --> 01:18:10,567
I apologize for the inconvenience.

831
01:20:00,944 --> 01:20:03,698
Hello, yes, this is it.

832
01:20:04,510 --> 01:20:08,374
Mr Eiji? Please hold on a moment

833
01:20:22,773 --> 01:20:23,360
From who?

834
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:25,406
She didn't say anything.

835
01:20:27,053 --> 01:20:28,770
Hello, it's me, Eiji.

836
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:30,907
Hello?

837
01:20:36,005 --> 01:20:36,665
Hello?

838
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:39,142
Hello?

839
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:41,459
Hello?

840
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:57,454
Satogiku has come.

841
01:20:57,479 --> 01:20:58,483
I see.

842
01:21:01,605 --> 01:21:02,851
Tome.

843
01:21:04,130 --> 01:21:07,823
Thanks for coming.
Fukudome is waiting for you.

844
01:21:08,627 --> 01:21:10,107
I'll have one drink.

845
01:21:10,404 --> 01:21:12,384
Come in.

846
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:34,162
What's wrong?

847
01:21:36,281 --> 01:21:37,561
Can you drink?

848
01:21:38,281 --> 01:21:39,207
Just little.

849
01:21:44,801 --> 01:21:46,809
Are you alright?

850
01:22:01,570 --> 01:22:03,564
I'll let you know as soon as she's ready

851
01:22:03,589 --> 01:22:04,718
Thanks.

852
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:13,355
Let's go together with him tomorrow morning

853
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:16,513
I am also going along with you.

854
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,390
Please come in.

855
01:22:23,820 --> 01:22:25,514
Are you ready?

856
01:22:26,717 --> 01:22:28,064
I'm counting on you.

857
01:22:31,442 --> 01:22:32,669
Wanna change clothes?

858
01:22:33,142 --> 01:22:34,149
I'll help it myself.

859
01:22:48,903 --> 01:22:50,428
Sorry for making you wait.

860
01:22:53,951 --> 01:22:56,691
She's all set.

861
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:00,360
President, please relax.

862
01:23:01,107 --> 01:23:02,773
You are stupid.

863
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:11,880
Excuse me.

864
01:23:14,842 --> 01:23:16,609
She's still child.

865
01:23:17,184 --> 01:23:19,264
Please look after her.

866
01:23:21,616 --> 01:23:22,623
I know.

867
01:23:24,018 --> 01:23:25,271
I'm counting on you.

868
01:24:10,025 --> 01:24:12,199
Shall we wake up a little and talk?

869
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:17,824
Satogiku

870
01:24:19,019 --> 01:24:21,052
How's it going? Have you already gone to sleep?

871
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:26,836
You sleep with your kimono on.

872
01:24:28,888 --> 01:24:30,728
Take it off.

873
01:24:47,624 --> 01:24:49,964
Okami!

874
01:24:50,701 --> 01:24:51,608
Okami!

875
01:25:00,476 --> 01:25:05,700
I have always believed that there is nothing stronger than love in this world

876
01:25:06,955 --> 01:25:10,744
As long as I love, I thought I could overcome any obstacle

877
01:25:12,330 --> 01:25:15,806
But I have various burdens that I cannot bear alone

878
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:21,885
I am sorry for making you, Eiji, chase after those burdens as well

879
01:25:23,740 --> 01:25:27,955
I have decided to pursue those burdens on my own

880
01:25:29,551 --> 01:25:31,626
After all, that was my destiny.

881
01:25:33,698 --> 01:25:37,760
I had a foolish heart with happiness I didn't want

882
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,095
Laughing at myself now

883
01:25:41,238 --> 01:25:49,127
I hope you and Eiji will live a happy life together.

884
01:26:09,776 --> 01:26:10,543
I see.

885
01:26:13,119 --> 01:26:13,939
From hospital?

886
01:26:13,979 --> 01:26:14,339
Yes.

887
01:26:18,530 --> 01:26:19,666
She's saved.

888
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:33,110
Brother, do you have a favor to ask me?

889
01:26:40,546 --> 01:26:41,885
Why didn't you consult me?

890
01:26:45,803 --> 01:26:46,669
You are stupid.

891
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:49,855
You can do anything if you are willing to die for it.

892
01:27:00,866 --> 01:27:03,866
Don't ever do anything like that again.

893
01:27:14,821 --> 01:27:15,294
Yes.

894
01:27:19,790 --> 01:27:21,038
Is it okay if I come in?

895
01:27:21,586 --> 01:27:22,166
Yes.

896
01:27:33,462 --> 01:27:39,183
I'm glad you are saved.
I read the letter and understood your feelings

897
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:40,788
I'm very happy.

898
01:27:43,804 --> 01:27:46,153
and I came to thank you.

899
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:52,358
Tomeko.

900
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:58,864
It must have been tough for you, Tomoko-san, right? But it's okay now

901
01:27:59,513 --> 01:28:02,513
Are you only thinking about Eri-san?

902
01:28:06,154 --> 01:28:07,068
But...

903
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,709
Don't say anything.

904
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:14,746
We are fair now.

905
01:28:17,610 --> 01:28:18,766
then, take care.

906
01:28:20,190 --> 01:28:21,844
I have something to talk with you,Eiji.

907
01:28:45,850 --> 01:28:48,850
I would like you to receive this, Tomoko-san,

908
01:28:49,821 --> 01:28:51,139
TOMEKO's Testimonials.

909
01:28:51,389 --> 01:28:52,369
TOMEKO's Testimonials?

910
01:28:53,844 --> 01:28:55,170
Why do you have this?

911
01:28:55,525 --> 01:28:57,465
This is present for you.

912
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,005
It's troubling for me.

913
01:29:01,220 --> 01:29:01,913
Why not?

914
01:29:03,509 --> 01:29:06,509
I don't want to cause trouble for your family

915
01:29:13,256 --> 01:29:14,562
Why do you say like that?

916
01:29:16,828 --> 01:29:18,999
Why can't you just accept it quietly?

917
01:29:19,618 --> 01:29:20,738
I really understand your actions

918
01:29:22,209 --> 01:29:23,812
But that wouldn't settle my feelings

919
01:29:24,025 --> 01:29:30,539
Keep this with me until I make up my mind.

920
01:29:37,485 --> 01:29:39,846
Just take it as it comes.

921
01:29:43,707 --> 01:29:44,561
Please.

922
01:30:54,723 --> 01:30:56,308
Look, over there.

923
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:08,889
Tome is there.

924
01:31:09,715 --> 01:31:10,549
Stop it.

925
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:12,906
1.2.3.

926
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:16,070
Tome-chan!

927
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:56,867
THE END

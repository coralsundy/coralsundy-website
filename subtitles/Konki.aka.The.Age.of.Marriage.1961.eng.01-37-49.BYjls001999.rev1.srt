<i>Konki / The Age of Marriage (1961)</i>

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,100
Sweetie !

4
00:02:11,289 --> 00:02:12,093
Hello?

5
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,234
Welcome.

6
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:20,476
Namiko sis.

7
00:02:23,242 --> 00:02:27,358
I really like the water pressure.
Ours is bad.

8
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,624
Here's clean.

9
00:02:29,664 --> 00:02:30,937
I like here.

10
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:33,914
I'll at least offer you some tea.
I even got compliments on the water pressure in the bathroom.

11
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:38,328
Oh yeah,
Look at this.

12
00:02:42,305 --> 00:02:43,063
Let me see.

13
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:46,625
This is cool.

14
00:02:46,828 --> 00:02:48,594
I want this.

15
00:02:49,023 --> 00:02:54,633
We are currently busy and are not accepting orders from anyone other than our regular customers.

16
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,953
I'll order it later.

17
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:59,016
He used money all.

18
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:00,281
Oh.

19
00:03:00,703 --> 00:03:03,539
Because she is away from him now.

20
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,141
We are miserable.

21
00:03:05,313 --> 00:03:07,578
She'll need the money if she studies at the theater company.

22
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:13,680
I can only make a little money teaching calligraphy.

23
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:16,844
Sorry to bother you.

24
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,945
Don't worry.

25
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,547
I came here by chance.

26
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,297
When is the calligraphy lesson?

27
00:03:20,477 --> 00:03:22,242
2pm.
Hatoko will go to theater lesson from 3pm.

28
00:03:22,305 --> 00:03:24,344
I'll have lunch here.

29
00:03:24,523 --> 00:03:25,609
I haven't eaten yet.

30
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:26,891
Wanna eat noodle?

31
00:03:26,961 --> 00:03:32,546
Then I wouldn't have come here.
I came here while talking with my sister about how delicious pickles are.

32
00:03:32,805 --> 00:03:34,227
Ask her to make it.

33
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:34,961
Who?

34
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:36,672
Shizuka.

35
00:03:54,457 --> 00:03:56,012
Here's your letter.

36
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,598
From whom?

37
00:04:01,863 --> 00:04:03,941
Don't you know?

38
00:04:04,558 --> 00:04:06,089
Have you cleaned Namiko and the kids' rooms yet?

39
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,996
You'll be scolded if you don't hang up your bedding soon.

40
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:10,699
I'll leave you to it.

41
00:04:10,832 --> 00:04:11,793
Wife.

42
00:04:13,965 --> 00:04:15,519
waistcoat.

43
00:04:17,308 --> 00:04:19,363
It's not a waistcoat, it's underwear.

44
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,285
She's busy.

45
00:04:26,887 --> 00:04:27,722
Baya.

46
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:29,683
Yes.

47
00:04:30,027 --> 00:04:31,121
I awake.

48
00:04:32,363 --> 00:04:33,722
I'm hungry.

49
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,950
Did you know that your husband Takuo has a mistress?

50
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:01,590
He has a baby now.

51
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:06,637
Your husband's love is no longer entirely yours

52
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:11,648
Wife.

53
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:18,171
Denjiro wanna eat ham egg but there's no egg.

54
00:05:18,196 --> 00:05:19,633
I think there was one egg.

55
00:05:19,875 --> 00:05:20,843
No.

56
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,742
I kept it.

57
00:05:22,767 --> 00:05:23,453
Really?

58
00:05:32,538 --> 00:05:35,148
Where's the egg?

59
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:43,507
What a strange.

60
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:48,858
You ate it.

61
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:50,545
Me?

62
00:05:52,772 --> 00:05:56,318
I will buy some eggs with my money.

63
00:05:56,616 --> 00:05:57,991
Denjiro

64
00:05:59,342 --> 00:06:01,264
There's a salad here, so bear with it.

65
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,061
You're stingy.

66
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,372
It tastes good.

67
00:06:11,513 --> 00:06:13,130
I like your cooking.

68
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,442
Watch out the bone.

69
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,065
What's wrong?

70
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:34,635
If our mother were alive, if we hadn't gone through all this trouble...

71
00:06:34,799 --> 00:06:36,416
Here she goes again.

72
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:39,026
We're like housemates.

73
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:40,002
No.

74
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:41,284
Yes we are.

75
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:44,010
Why don't you go out on your own?

76
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,245
No, women can't.

77
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,353
Your brother must be in trouble.

78
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:50,198
He inherited his dead father's estate.

79
00:06:50,736 --> 00:06:54,595
He switched his business and now runs a Chinzan inn.

80
00:06:54,955 --> 00:06:57,924
You better find a good guy soon.

81
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:01,260
All the guys in the troupe were part-timers.
I was disappointed when I joined.

82
00:07:01,534 --> 00:07:03,182
I don't care if I'm just looking for love.

83
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,127
Do you have any good men for me?

84
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:10,174
You are still young, so you should choose your man more carefully.

85
00:07:11,275 --> 00:07:13,494
I'm too old.

86
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:18,127
I'm okay with men up to 40 years old.

87
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:19,338
If he has any kids?

88
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:22,486
He's better off not having kids.

89
00:07:22,814 --> 00:07:24,189
But it's depends.

90
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:25,517
You have fallen behind.

91
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,142
Yes I'm looser.

92
00:07:27,806 --> 00:07:28,830
I'm 29.

93
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:29,650
This year?

94
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:30,923
No.

95
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:32,306
You look young.

96
00:07:33,118 --> 00:07:36,212


97
00:07:36,237 --> 00:07:37,056
Yeah.

98
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,947
You're 24?

99
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:40,181
I'll turn to 25.

100
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:41,752
I feel scary.

101
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:45,401
What's wrong?

102
00:07:45,877 --> 00:07:46,557
Water.

103
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:48,776
You are still eating.

104
00:07:48,862 --> 00:07:49,776
Excuse me.

105
00:07:50,627 --> 00:07:52,432
You're just fantasizing about ideals

106
00:07:52,612 --> 00:07:54,526
Will you preach to me again?

107
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:55,666
I'm right.

108
00:07:55,963 --> 00:07:58,245
I'm just being cautious because I'm looking at you.

109
00:07:58,495 --> 00:08:01,893
All men are the same.
Marriage isn't everything in life.

110
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:03,486
It's nice to know someone who's been married before.

111
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,799
It's nice to break up too.

112
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,564
I feel like a sellout.

113
00:08:07,589 --> 00:08:09,737
You say that and then nothing gets done.

114
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:14,885
Oh there is.

115
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:20,893
I found this here.

116
00:08:21,362 --> 00:08:23,924
I'm sure hatoko or Namiko put it here.

117
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:25,815
It seemed like I lied.

118
00:08:25,893 --> 00:08:32,041
She played a prank on me.

119
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:34,713
Have a good day.

120
00:08:36,088 --> 00:08:38,580
What a surprise!

121
00:08:48,407 --> 00:08:51,063
Hi.it's me.

122
00:08:52,556 --> 00:08:55,939
Tell my sister to pick me up around 9:00 p.m. today.

123
00:08:57,735 --> 00:08:58,728
Of course.

124
00:08:59,321 --> 00:09:04,564
You're young, so you should go home early.

125
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:08,227
What are you talking about? I'm a virgin.

126
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:13,415
Even if you're not a virgin, the danger is in the same
That's what I'm talking about.

127
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:16,259
Did you hide the egg?

128
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,306
Egg?

129
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,110
Why I had to do that?

130
00:09:22,415 --> 00:09:24,259
I'm not stupid enough to say that over the phone.

131
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,622
She's so stupid.

132
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:50,319
Did you know that your husband Takuo has a mistress?

133
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:59,191
He has a baby now.

134
00:10:20,647 --> 00:10:23,920
No mail came when I was out?

135
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:25,240
No.

136
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,115
Are you sure?

137
00:10:31,292 --> 00:10:33,417
I'll take care of it.

138
00:10:34,402 --> 00:10:35,535
It would be quicker if I did it with yours.

139
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,371
I don't like it if I don't do it myself.

140
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:38,847
I see.

141
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,535
Wife.

142
00:10:42,746 --> 00:10:45,722
I'll go pick up a virgin girl.

143
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,347
But you can't walk.

144
00:10:49,035 --> 00:10:52,081
I wouldn't mind losing my chastity.

145
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,605
What are you talking about?
I thought you never had it.

146
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,613
Don't talk so loud.

147
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:02,496
I've had three husbands.
Not all at once

148
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,097
They died one after another.

149
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,331
You are greedy.

150
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:08,691
But...

151
00:11:08,925 --> 00:11:11,363
Stop saying it.

152
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:20,441
Baya.

153
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,253
The light is off.

154
00:11:25,831 --> 00:11:29,597
Namiko told me to turn off unnecessary lights.

155
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,730
Shall I turn them on then?

156
00:11:34,987 --> 00:11:36,167
Take care.

157
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:40,558
There are so many commands that I'm at a loss.

158
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,719
I'm not very good at this ironing thing.

159
00:12:13,303 --> 00:12:16,779
I'm afraid of this electric thing.

160
00:12:20,442 --> 00:12:23,880
That's right... a silk one.

161
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:26,435
Don't do that.

162
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,037
Let me do it.

163
00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:40,363
You're good.

164
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,582
A man with a wife like mine is truly a lucky man.

165
00:12:43,607 --> 00:12:44,817
Yeah.

166
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:49,223
Cooking school, tea, flowers, dressmaking.

167
00:12:49,621 --> 00:12:54,590
Watercolors, piano, embroidery, knitting...
Knitting, Kamakura carving...

168
00:12:54,798 --> 00:12:55,329
And..

169
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,290
French.

170
00:12:56,315 --> 00:12:56,735
Yes.

171
00:12:56,837 --> 00:13:01,977
Gymnastics History Pearls Addition Subtraction Multiplication

172
00:13:02,002 --> 00:13:02,860
That's not a school.

173
00:13:02,923 --> 00:13:06,251
You've learned everything you need to know.
You just don't know how to use it.

174
00:13:06,548 --> 00:13:07,618
I'm like Okubo Hikozaemon.

175
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:09,665
It's pointless to learn in a broad and shallow way

176
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:10,954
People like it.

177
00:13:11,087 --> 00:13:14,649
There's a song about who did this to me.

178
00:13:15,063 --> 00:13:17,376
It's all society's fault

179
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:21,071
Men are to blame.
Men are so blind.

180
00:13:21,313 --> 00:13:26,048
You are Such a beautiful young lady.
But no one want you.

181
00:13:26,298 --> 00:13:28,587
I just had fat legs.

182
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,938
I'm jealous of wife.

183
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:32,602
What do you mean?

184
00:13:32,696 --> 00:13:34,438
She hangs her waistcoat all year round.

185
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:37,352
She's not wearing a waistcoat, she's wearing underwear.

186
00:13:37,729 --> 00:13:38,964
She's busy.

187
00:13:39,284 --> 00:13:42,597
She's the one who's shifting this wife.
Men are so blind.

188
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,643
It's like the saying, "A cracked pot with a mashed lid.

189
00:13:46,682 --> 00:13:47,744
Her husband's a cracked pot?

190
00:13:48,018 --> 00:13:51,315
He's a very handsome man.

191
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,604
He is very strict with money management.

192
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:55,550
Fold them.

193
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:57,933
Help yourself.

194
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:04,808
You won't improve at all even if I teach you.

195
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:07,852
Did the mail come today?

196
00:14:08,454 --> 00:14:09,633
No letter for you.

197
00:14:09,946 --> 00:14:11,094
For wife.

198
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:15,766
Thank you very much.

199
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,127
What's the hell?

200
00:14:57,588 --> 00:14:58,815
No.

201
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:00,975
Hatoko.

202
00:15:02,733 --> 00:15:04,100
Wait.

203
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:13,506
Sweet potato

204
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:20,209
I'm like a bodyguard.

205
00:15:20,686 --> 00:15:23,006
It's normal to protect young people.

206
00:15:23,031 --> 00:15:27,147
Still, you must have a lot of courage with her.

207
00:15:27,475 --> 00:15:29,748
It helps her, doesn't it?

208
00:15:35,106 --> 00:15:35,817
Is she ok?

209
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:37,708
She seems not care about the letter.

210
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:38,965
She's so cheeky.

211
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,176
Maybe she doesn't trust that her husband is having a baby.

212
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:42,614
She's so proud.

213
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,090
She know she's the only one who got love from him.

214
00:15:45,223 --> 00:15:49,723
She's in it for the fortune.
She thinks that once we're done, she'll be free to do whatever she wants.

215
00:15:51,008 --> 00:15:53,117
I won't let her have her way.

216
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:59,172
Shall I wash your body?

217
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,750
Don't worry.

218
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:08,516
She pretends to be a good housewife.

219
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:12,132
I'd better get you guys to bed early.

220
00:16:12,157 --> 00:16:13,758
I haven't taken a bath yet.

221
00:16:15,283 --> 00:16:16,478
Give me one.

222
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:19,517
One?

223
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:24,908
He's finished with his bath.

224
00:16:31,034 --> 00:16:31,839
Bros.

225
00:16:32,245 --> 00:16:33,542
Do me a favor.

226
00:16:34,479 --> 00:16:35,831
I am very tired today

227
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:43,360
He's boring.

228
00:17:21,126 --> 00:17:22,329
Have a bath.

229
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,650
Have a bath first.

230
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:31,282
I have to do something.

231
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,314
I'll have bath with her.

232
00:17:37,582 --> 00:17:39,464
You take bath first.

233
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:58,462
Are there many lines you have to memorize?

234
00:17:58,837 --> 00:18:01,891
Just one line.
Good night. I'll act as nurse.

235
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,243
Then you don't have to read the script.

236
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:05,985
I'm going to have to say it a dozen times.

237
00:18:06,501 --> 00:18:08,774
I'm sick of it.
I want to quit.

238
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:11,462
If you have a chance to meet someone nice, you can just quit.

239
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,806
Please take turns taking a bath.

240
00:18:14,892 --> 00:18:16,446
I'm working right now.

241
00:18:16,524 --> 00:18:18,806
We waited for him because we had a favor to ask of Bros.

242
00:18:18,915 --> 00:18:21,079
He said he was very tired today.

243
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:24,587
Please take a bath quickly.

244
00:18:24,712 --> 00:18:25,954
Shut up!

245
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,959
Let's have a bath.

246
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:44,903
pass me the glass.

247
00:18:48,786 --> 00:18:49,692
49kg.

248
00:18:51,544 --> 00:18:52,341
That's a lot less.

249
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,341
Glad to hear it.

250
00:18:56,507 --> 00:18:59,007
Oh 55 kg.

251
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:01,734
You ate a lot at saeko's house.

252
00:19:01,992 --> 00:19:05,664
It can't be helped.
Try measuring my hips

253
00:19:10,114 --> 00:19:10,723
Done?

254
00:19:12,403 --> 00:19:14,052
It's little fat.

255
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:15,910
What size?

256
00:19:16,161 --> 00:19:20,630
I think you're overweight because you're short.

257
00:19:20,854 --> 00:19:22,455
I won't eat anything tomorrow

258
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,143
You should practice ballet like me.

259
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:31,604
I'm sure Oshizu tell about the letter to bros.

260
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,637
Denjiro is back.

261
00:20:05,041 --> 00:20:06,205
Hello?

262
00:20:07,268 --> 00:20:08,744
Welcome back.

263
00:20:08,955 --> 00:20:10,260
Come in.

264
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:14,440
I haven't had dinner yet, so please prepare something.

265
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:16,705
Welcome back.

266
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:17,869
I'm home.

267
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,447
You are late.

268
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,674
We were watching a movie.

269
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,268
Let me introduce her
My girlfriend.

270
00:20:28,668 --> 00:20:31,277
Her mother works at my brother's Chinzanso.

271
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:32,996
Is she maid?

272
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:34,457
I don't think so?

273
00:20:34,957 --> 00:20:35,777
Head maid?

274
00:20:36,324 --> 00:20:37,457
Manager?

275
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,097
Come in.

276
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,621
My room is there.

277
00:20:51,569 --> 00:20:54,226
He walked a lot.

278
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,382
Wife, if that's her, your sisters see her out and about a lot.

279
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:05,234
They know her?

280
00:21:06,718 --> 00:21:08,640
Since half year ago.

281
00:21:08,749 --> 00:21:10,249


282
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:13,398
She's coming over here so late.
Her mom does not care?

283
00:21:13,742 --> 00:21:15,249
I know she use him.

284
00:21:15,617 --> 00:21:16,664
What do you mean?

285
00:21:16,882 --> 00:21:18,843
She thinks he's good target.

286
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,710
I can't believe it.

287
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:25,601
Apparently her mother gave birth to him while being the mistress of an official.

288
00:21:26,156 --> 00:21:27,718
How could you possibly know that?

289
00:21:28,093 --> 00:21:31,624
Because your sisters told me.

290
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:34,398
Where's sisters?

291
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:35,609
They are having a bath.

292
00:21:36,515 --> 00:21:37,437
There.

293
00:21:40,506 --> 00:21:41,209
Good evening.

294
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:41,944
Welcome.

295
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,623
Thank you very much for the other night.
for taking on so many roles in the troupe.

296
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:45,633
Not at all.

297
00:21:45,658 --> 00:21:47,577
I'll ask again next time.

298
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,560
There will be a Fukakka play next month.

299
00:21:50,585 --> 00:21:51,147
Fuka?

300
00:21:51,172 --> 00:21:51,827
Fukakka

301
00:21:52,381 --> 00:21:54,537
You don't know what they're doing because it's hard to understand, right?

302
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,507
But she played good.

303
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,257
You didn't play with her,right?

304
00:21:58,366 --> 00:22:00,014
No, but I looked her.

305
00:22:00,616 --> 00:22:04,179
Her acting time was very short.

306
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,280
It was too short.

307
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:07,968
I was not a passerby.

308
00:22:08,381 --> 00:22:10,655
Please tell your mother to sell tickets to the next show.

309
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,671
Please…

310
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:16,163
I have a calligraphy exhibition coming up.

311
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,655
Wanna play Majan?

312
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:19,952
From now?

313
00:22:20,186 --> 00:22:22,335
We have enough people for playing it.

314
00:22:22,874 --> 00:22:24,600
It's beauty time.

315
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,327
Why don't you just sleep until noon tomorrow?

316
00:22:26,352 --> 00:22:27,608
Bros is going out?

317
00:22:27,741 --> 00:22:28,827
Why you care him?

318
00:22:29,046 --> 00:22:31,843
We often see him.

319
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:35,718
It's beauty time, sisters, so don't push it.

320
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:36,733
Wanna bet?

321
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:37,366
Yes.

322
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:38,663
We can earn money.

323
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:39,179
OK.

324
00:22:39,397 --> 00:22:40,233
Let's go.

325
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,694
We don't all eat together, so fuel costs go up.

326
00:22:48,913 --> 00:22:53,405
I'm very frustrated with them complaining.

327
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:55,358
Don't say that. Be patient.

328
00:22:55,733 --> 00:22:58,249
I need you.

329
00:22:58,569 --> 00:23:04,327
Thanks.
I don't need to take a bath.

330
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:06,108
Ok have a rest.

331
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:10,788
I have exceeded my working hours so I will take the day off first.

332
00:23:12,366 --> 00:23:17,663
Your husband is leaving tomorrow at 7am.

333
00:23:17,991 --> 00:23:21,397
Is he going to stop by somewhere before he goes?

334
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:38,772
Your meal is ready at your room.

335
00:23:39,116 --> 00:23:41,616
Ok, let's have meal first.

336
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:44,904
Baya.

337
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:49,044
You still have oranges, don't you?

338
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,646
One for each of you

339
00:23:51,671 --> 00:23:52,490
How about snacks?

340
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,373
I forgot if that was the case

341
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,802
Why is there nothing here?

342
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,731
If I buy them, they will be gone before I know it.

343
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:04,106
I'm sure Bros brought some home from work that someone else gave to him.

344
00:24:04,388 --> 00:24:05,513
She hides everything.

345
00:24:05,623 --> 00:24:06,685
Sis hides it.

346
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:07,935
Really?

347
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:10,912
We are not free to eat.

348
00:24:11,623 --> 00:24:14,505
There is always nothing

349
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:18,005
You think Denjiro eats it?

350
00:24:18,435 --> 00:24:21,115
Don't make him a thief's errand boy.

351
00:24:21,443 --> 00:24:22,873
He's not educated.

352
00:24:23,224 --> 00:24:26,318
I learned a lot from your former owner.

353
00:24:26,645 --> 00:24:28,489
You're getting carried away.

354
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,326
It's okay for the residents of this house to eat snacks freely.

355
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:39,060
We were born in this house.

356
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,138
She thinks we are leaving soon.

357
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,912
I'm frustrates to live here.

358
00:24:46,255 --> 00:24:47,732
I don't have a life of my own.

359
00:24:47,849 --> 00:24:49,474
What can I help you?

360
00:24:55,173 --> 00:24:58,767
The guests... the lady is staying at sister's room.

361
00:24:59,157 --> 00:25:00,157
I see.

362
00:25:01,556 --> 00:25:05,470
You don't need to carry it yourself.

363
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,235
I'm sorry.

364
00:25:09,055 --> 00:25:13,571
I can't help you.
I'm afraid I've become a winner.

365
00:25:15,532 --> 00:25:19,892
Denjiro wants you to bring some toys?

366
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,173
What you want?

367
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:22,571
pat.

368
00:25:22,837 --> 00:25:25,274
Denjiro has baseball pat.

369
00:25:25,782 --> 00:25:28,016
No, pat and tex.

370
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,165
I don't know about it.

371
00:25:33,368 --> 00:25:35,274
You are too old.
Never mind.

372
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:47,101
Is she staying tonight?

373
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:50,390
She is bad manners

374
00:25:50,835 --> 00:25:55,312
Yeah, she's really bad.

375
00:25:55,866 --> 00:25:59,491
Do men like women like that?

376
00:26:00,015 --> 00:26:05,069
She won't know unless she live with her.
Even Namiko and her family are graceful to other people.

377
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:09,562
They used to be nice.

378
00:26:10,015 --> 00:26:11,531
You think they are bad now because of me?

379
00:26:12,054 --> 00:26:18,195
As they get older,their personality gets worse.
Hatoko is now so bad.

380
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:20,382
Namiko tell her about anything.

381
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:24,320
I want them to get married and move out of this house.

382
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:26,984
Don't say that.

383
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:33,171
But if we don't be strict with them, they'll stay here forever.

384
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:36,163
their personality gets worse.

385
00:26:36,445 --> 00:26:39,234
They're even worse than last year.

386
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:40,734
What's the hell?

387
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:45,359
It's funny, but I think it's serious for the person in question.

388
00:26:45,866 --> 00:26:51,928
The fact that there is no one to sympathize with her must be even more sad for her, since she doesn't have a mother.

389
00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:53,976
She's almost 30.

390
00:26:54,702 --> 00:27:00,741
After all, Saeko-sama.
Their big sister's marriage partner was very egocentric.

391
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:09,093
They saw her go through a lot of hardships.
That's partly why they think so hard.

392
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:14,140
When will they get married?

393
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,116
Reach.

394
00:27:17,343 --> 00:27:18,804
You're lucky.

395
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,179
This?

396
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:22,077
Ron?

397
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:24,366
I got it.

398
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,546
You made it?

399
00:27:25,571 --> 00:27:26,679
Like someone.

400
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:27,499
Who?

401
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:29,882
Who?

402
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,616
My sis.

403
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,991
That woman?

404
00:27:35,702 --> 00:27:36,843
She is 29.

405
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,874
Oh she's too old.

406
00:27:40,499 --> 00:27:43,476
She's been Unsold fro a long time.

407
00:27:46,335 --> 00:27:47,272
What's wrong?

408
00:27:49,647 --> 00:27:52,046
I can't see.
Bring my glasses.

409
00:27:53,069 --> 00:27:56,655
It's in the bathtub.

410
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,632
She's sleeping.

411
00:27:59,853 --> 00:28:00,775
Never mind.

412
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:04,533
you.

413
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,112
Are you sleeping?

414
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:23,870
Tomorrow ok?

415
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:28,534
I don't have time to talk to you in the morning.

416
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,081
I'm busy.

417
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:37,604
You're just sleeping.

418
00:28:38,081 --> 00:28:41,784
Denjiro said he's bringing a girl to stay the night.

419
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:42,370
Who?

420
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,893
She is the daughter of one of your hotel's employees.

421
00:28:45,206 --> 00:28:47,534
I am in a lot of trouble

422
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,753
Get out her then.

423
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:50,831
Can you tell him?

424
00:28:50,878 --> 00:28:52,237
You say him.

425
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,003
They are playing majan.

426
00:28:56,792 --> 00:29:00,136
I'm sleeping so you can say it yourself.

427
00:29:00,347 --> 00:29:02,784
They don't listen to me.

428
00:29:02,956 --> 00:29:05,112
Just leave it her.

429
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,847
Her mother might be worried.

430
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:10,198
Don't worry.

431
00:29:10,464 --> 00:29:11,518
Are you alright?

432
00:29:12,261 --> 00:29:16,323
We don't need to worry about her.

433
00:29:18,322 --> 00:29:19,884
Where did you go last night?

434
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:22,509
It's none of your business.

435
00:29:22,751 --> 00:29:23,954
I worried.

436
00:29:24,064 --> 00:29:25,704
I slept in the car.

437
00:29:25,729 --> 00:29:26,728
I can't believe it.

438
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:28,361
You don't have to trust me

439
00:29:29,111 --> 00:29:32,626
I got weird letter that say you have a baby.

440
00:29:35,197 --> 00:29:38,720
I hear you have a mistress, is that true?

441
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,079
No.

442
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:41,954
Tell us me truth.

443
00:29:42,337 --> 00:29:43,767
If you don't believe me, so be it.

444
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:50,434
You have no idea what I've been through.

445
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,300
What are you talking about?
I know you had a man.

446
00:30:02,028 --> 00:30:04,122
You weren't virgin.

447
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:07,059
How can you say that?

448
00:30:07,512 --> 00:30:10,309
I was very disappointed on our honeymoon.

449
00:30:12,973 --> 00:30:15,575
You're just now starting to talk about our honeymoon.

450
00:30:16,324 --> 00:30:22,074
I gained a lot of knowledge before I got married.

451
00:30:22,192 --> 00:30:23,661
You were too much.

452
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,684
You told me I was not kisser.

453
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:27,168
Don't say that.

454
00:30:27,473 --> 00:30:28,301
Who taught you?

455
00:30:28,622 --> 00:30:30,512
The way you kissed was different from how it was described in the book.

456
00:30:30,731 --> 00:30:33,356
I was going to teach you step by step.

457
00:30:33,911 --> 00:30:35,801
Since then I've lost interest in you

458
00:30:35,957 --> 00:30:36,879
What's the hell?

459
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,551
Show me the letter.

460
00:30:49,967 --> 00:30:52,678
Are you planning to get compensation from me with this plan?

461
00:30:53,147 --> 00:30:54,826
From you?

462
00:30:54,851 --> 00:30:55,905
You're mean.

463
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,069
You think so?

464
00:30:59,670 --> 00:31:01,795
Do you find it interesting to bully someone like that?

465
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,491
Okay, I'll go to the hospital, or wherever, and I'll be vindicated.

466
00:31:07,819 --> 00:31:09,959
It's too late.
You can't prove you were a virgin.

467
00:31:10,163 --> 00:31:13,061
What's so wrong with me?

468
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:18,311
It's not fun to come home.
That's why I purposely come home late.

469
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,725
If you didn't like me so much, why did you marry me?

470
00:31:21,022 --> 00:31:22,959
I just liked your looks.

471
00:31:25,139 --> 00:31:26,311
Don't think too much.

472
00:31:28,436 --> 00:31:30,975
I knew we should've stayed together you and me only.

473
00:31:31,631 --> 00:31:33,999
That's how you feel, and that's how everyone else feels.

474
00:31:35,163 --> 00:31:36,694
It's your fault.

475
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:39,834
I worked so hard.

476
00:31:39,859 --> 00:31:44,467
It's a formality.
You're bringing in the fact that you were working for a loan company on your own.

477
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:47,045
I'm like president, Namiko is manager.

478
00:31:48,858 --> 00:31:52,858
hatoko is chef, Denjiro is co-worker.

479
00:31:53,499 --> 00:31:55,420
You're treating them with class.

480
00:31:55,881 --> 00:32:02,702
I expected the housewife to be the pillar of the family, supporting the stronghold of everyone's trust and love.

481
00:32:03,044 --> 00:32:05,763
You wear a loincloth and makes the maid work

482
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,264
Namiko said that?

483
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,154
If you're good, everyone respects you.

484
00:32:09,889 --> 00:32:11,553
Did you really mean what you said?

485
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,850
Sometimes I'm so busy that I don't have time to take care of myself.

486
00:32:15,397 --> 00:32:19,389
I don't even have time to change the elastic in my underwear when it's stretched out, so it can go down.

487
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:24,654
My underwear fell down once.
It has nothing to do with your affair.

488
00:32:24,687 --> 00:32:26,467
Don't be loud.

489
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:28,983
Shut up!

490
00:32:29,936 --> 00:32:31,834
I have to wake up early

491
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:35,709
Don't lie to me, wake up.

492
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:38,808
So it's true.

493
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:40,097
Someone sent that as a prank.

494
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:40,894
But.

495
00:32:41,323 --> 00:32:43,339
If you don't trust me, you can leave me.

496
00:32:43,644 --> 00:32:44,909
Are you serious?

497
00:32:44,934 --> 00:32:45,972
Yes I am.

498
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,058
Wanna separate with me?

499
00:32:47,386 --> 00:32:48,425
Shut up!

500
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:50,464
Get out.

501
00:32:51,011 --> 00:32:52,292
Wanna separate with me?

502
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:54,441
I mean I will get out.

503
00:33:00,631 --> 00:33:03,107
You're terrible.

504
00:33:06,037 --> 00:33:07,201
You insist.

505
00:33:39,362 --> 00:33:41,299
You look funny.

506
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,627
Don't make me laugh, I'll get wrinkles

507
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:46,213
Oh sorry.

508
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:49,541
So?

509
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:52,737
So we went to separate rooms, and we rested.

510
00:33:54,721 --> 00:33:56,143
So you'll sleep separately?

511
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:59,635
Of course, my husband insisted, so I had no choice.

512
00:34:00,877 --> 00:34:04,338
Marriage is just like going to a maid's house.

513
00:34:05,034 --> 00:34:07,377
A maid gets a day off and a salary.

514
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:10,526
A maid is much better.

515
00:34:11,596 --> 00:34:13,659
If it's a sex toy, it's not worth it.

516
00:34:14,229 --> 00:34:15,041
It's free.

517
00:34:15,573 --> 00:34:16,854
You think so?

518
00:34:17,377 --> 00:34:19,854
You should divorce him.

519
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:23,315
You don't have kids yet.
Why don't you get on your feet?

520
00:34:24,354 --> 00:34:27,455
I'm talking about basic human rights.

521
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:31,854
Why does everyone want to get married?

522
00:34:32,315 --> 00:34:33,604
I can't help but wonder.

523
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:38,877
I can't work like you.
I'm too old.

524
00:34:39,151 --> 00:34:44,096
What would you do if your husband died?
You have to work.

525
00:34:44,362 --> 00:34:47,174
That's true, but I've persevered this long.

526
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,799
If you persevere, half of the property will be yours.

527
00:34:51,713 --> 00:34:54,034
If that's the case, then you'll have to be patient.

528
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:59,846
It is doubtful how many people in the world can earn that much in a lifetime of work.

529
00:35:00,752 --> 00:35:03,580
It's a tall tale, depending on how you look at it.
Which would you take?

530
00:35:04,299 --> 00:35:07,627
But if I didn't have love, I wouldn't have persevered this long.

531
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:13,104
Love can't last forever.

532
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,760
f you're satisfied, I have nothing to say.

533
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:22,393
And if it's hard work, then it's not hard work at all.

534
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,893
It's time.
Turn it off.

535
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:34,602
Turn the red light.

536
00:35:44,594 --> 00:35:50,352
He's got money,you don't have  mother-in-law, don't worry about the sisters.

537
00:35:51,688 --> 00:35:54,993
You can control them.

538
00:35:55,383 --> 00:35:56,415
They are pure.

539
00:35:56,633 --> 00:36:00,149
You say that, but I don't have that kind of power.

540
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:04,219
You're just trying to look good, so they'll want to feel your heart.

541
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:10,290
They want to see you bare your heart, so they're going to smash your pretensions.

542
00:36:10,985 --> 00:36:12,555
My pretensions?

543
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:15,868
They don't like your attitude.

544
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,805
I'm not going to let you put a damper on our marriage!

545
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,485
Anyway, he even had a child out of the house!

546
00:36:26,047 --> 00:36:27,321
I can't believe it.

547
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,008
I can't believe it too.

548
00:36:30,743 --> 00:36:34,797
Or if it's a boy and his property is going that way.

549
00:36:35,399 --> 00:36:37,297
But I think that's someone's idea of a prank.

550
00:36:38,618 --> 00:36:41,954
Someone is hoping you'd leave.

551
00:36:42,219 --> 00:36:43,735
He has a girl?

552
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,641
My brother's been a target for a long time.

553
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:49,329
Women are more likely to leave him alone.

554
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:57,430
You can't marry a man unless you're prepared for him to be a little unfaithful.

555
00:36:57,594 --> 00:37:05,743
My husband's not like other men. He's reserved with his brothers.
I feel sorry for him.

556
00:37:06,478 --> 00:37:12,986
He thinks it's bad if he makes them look too friendly, so he pushes himself.

557
00:37:14,556 --> 00:37:17,384
If you're so understanding, I have nothing to say.

558
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,853
No man gets a perfect score.

559
00:37:23,591 --> 00:37:29,122
I chose divorce.
You're always clinging on, going your own way.

560
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,357
Oh you.

561
00:37:38,354 --> 00:37:42,955
I can't go out.
I have a fashion show to prepare for.

562
00:37:43,651 --> 00:37:49,979
You don't know that, do you?
You can't just say that out of the blue.

563
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:56,760
And then there's the silk.
The colors are a little different.

564
00:37:57,112 --> 00:38:01,823
Do you have a deeper color in your company's product?

565
00:38:02,432 --> 00:38:06,917
Please find it and look for it.
I'm sorry.

566
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:14,170
I'm busy with my work.
Don't be so mad.

567
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:16,709
I'm sorry.

568
00:38:21,334 --> 00:38:24,725
You've been busy. Are you going out?

569
00:38:26,936 --> 00:38:31,795
Yeah, I was up all night last night.
This pack won't help.

570
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,751
It's hard work, isn't it?

571
00:38:39,094 --> 00:38:40,923
I'm poor and I have no time.

572
00:38:44,235 --> 00:38:46,126
I heard your complaints.

573
00:38:48,337 --> 00:38:52,548
I just wanted to talk to you.

574
00:38:52,782 --> 00:38:56,680
Because if you're not going to break up with him, seeing you is just a waste of time.

575
00:38:56,962 --> 00:39:00,462
And even if he had a child outside, you wouldn't leave.

576
00:39:00,602 --> 00:39:04,923
I don't want to let him have his way.

577
00:39:05,774 --> 00:39:06,360
I see.

578
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:11,735
Besides, I can't go back to the country and take care of my father and clean up Chestnut Mountain.

579
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,462
I can't do that.

580
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,040
Here is ok?

581
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,258
Yes.

582
00:39:29,368 --> 00:39:34,899
President
Our guests from Kyokuto Petroleum are pleased to know that you are in the OGI ROOM!

583
00:39:34,924 --> 00:39:35,852
I'm glad to hear it.

584
00:39:36,071 --> 00:39:37,836
I heard that the number of attendees will be reduced.

585
00:39:37,868 --> 00:39:39,633
What is our schedule today?

586
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:45,376
By this evening, we will have two wedding receptions and two meetings.

587
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,860
And for the evening party...

588
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,743
There's a phone call for you, sir.

589
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:51,212
Excuse me for a moment.

590
00:39:51,781 --> 00:39:52,546
Front desk.

591
00:39:55,429 --> 00:40:00,937
Last night, my daughter Renko accompanied Denjiro to the restaurant.

592
00:40:01,851 --> 00:40:04,281
Ok leave it to you.

593
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:10,415
I got a call from Tamie.

594
00:40:11,813 --> 00:40:13,954
She said Come to see me tonight.

595
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:15,556
Why she said it to you?

596
00:40:15,665 --> 00:40:18,056
We were talking about another matter.

597
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,595
You were in the middle of a visit, and I told her I would tell you later.

598
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:27,973
She was worried that you've been coming home a lot lately.

599
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:29,793
Tell her not to call me.

600
00:40:37,013 --> 00:40:38,084
Take care.

601
00:41:03,899 --> 00:41:05,719
Oh Tomoe.

602
00:41:07,422 --> 00:41:08,383
Excuse me.

603
00:41:10,743 --> 00:41:12,875
It's been a while.
back home now?

604
00:41:13,093 --> 00:41:17,617
I was just visiting the soap factory, and I thought I'd go home.

605
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,543
How's everyone at the office?

606
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:20,777
They're fine.

607
00:41:21,293 --> 00:41:22,793
Has anyone quitted working since then?

608
00:41:24,245 --> 00:41:25,144
No.

609
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,894
They are not like you.

610
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:28,847
Why?

611
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:30,996
Are you busy on the bed?

612
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:32,621
Wanna sit?

613
00:41:32,646 --> 00:41:34,668
Don't worry about me.

614
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:37,605
People are watching us.

615
00:41:37,886 --> 00:41:40,066
The other day, everyone was talking about you.

616
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:40,870
What kind?

617
00:41:40,895 --> 00:41:42,121
They said you were lucky.

618
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,075
But it seems you have a hard time.

619
00:41:46,169 --> 00:41:47,622
If only I could get rid of my sisters.

620
00:41:47,647 --> 00:41:48,294
Then you will be happy.

621
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:49,575
Please introduce them to a good man.

622
00:41:49,732 --> 00:41:53,146
I know one good guy.

623
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:55,318
Who's he like?

624
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,145
My cousin.
I have a picture of him.

625
00:41:58,552 --> 00:42:01,169
But not for me.
He says it's because she's beautiful.

626
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:05,857
But she have to have a long torso, and not wears glasses,young.

627
00:42:06,474 --> 00:42:07,638
I see.

628
00:42:12,887 --> 00:42:13,652
He.

629
00:42:16,355 --> 00:42:18,582
He looks loopy.

630
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:21,457
I wonder if they can live on that kind of salary.

631
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:23,496
His mother has an apartment.

632
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:27,160
Hatoko can't live with her mom together.

633
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:31,668
This guy says he doesn't like women with glasses... he's wearing a glass.

634
00:42:32,215 --> 00:42:33,723
He's egoist.

635
00:42:33,748 --> 00:42:35,918
I made it.

636
00:42:36,473 --> 00:42:37,746
He's thinking about genetics.

637
00:42:37,879 --> 00:42:38,770
I made it.

638
00:42:38,809 --> 00:42:40,027
I get it.

639
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:44,129
Ok go home.

640
00:42:52,094 --> 00:42:53,500
Why don't you introduce him to my sis?

641
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:57,367
I also talked to her.

642
00:42:58,062 --> 00:42:59,991
He's not well paid.

643
00:43:00,016 --> 00:43:01,851
The salary of 13,000 yen is too little.

644
00:43:02,234 --> 00:43:04,101
But he has fixed assets.

645
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,570
That's not enough.

646
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:09,375
He's only son, don't have any siblings.
You'll be like Namiko...

647
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:11,703
I don't care if he's old.

648
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:16,359
I don't mind having two or three children
I want to marry someone who has no shortage of money.

649
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:21,070
I want someone with a fatherly bearing.

650
00:43:21,297 --> 00:43:23,672
I'm offering my youth.

651
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,601
No one will give it to you if you keep talking about ideals.

652
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:35,736
I had an older brother who died in the war, and an uncle who went to Tokyo University, and I went to a government school, so I didn't really want to go to private school.

653
00:43:37,291 --> 00:43:39,314
But you have to lower your bar a little bit.

654
00:43:39,705 --> 00:43:44,455
Next year, we'll lower the bar.
And my sister, she's going to decide to be whoever she is when March comes next year.

655
00:43:45,095 --> 00:43:46,595
See you.

656
00:43:49,549 --> 00:43:51,525
See you.

657
00:43:53,971 --> 00:43:55,455
Are you still looking?

658
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,494
Why don't you meet him?
He might be a nice guy.

659
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:02,370
It's rare to find someone with a fixed asset nowadays.

660
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,018
You're making an issue out of it, but that's just like you.

661
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:06,776
Well, I guess I'll say no.

662
00:44:08,549 --> 00:44:10,643
I don't want it to be my fault.

663
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:16,963
I don't mind dating him.
I wouldn't mind having him buy me a ticket to the theater troupe, or being available to ski or drive with him.

664
00:44:17,268 --> 00:44:19,221
I can say no at the end.
Shall I do that?

665
00:44:19,463 --> 00:44:25,955
It would be very bad for him to do that.
His mother is the problem.

666
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,963
I think I can control her well..

667
00:44:29,315 --> 00:44:30,995
So you want to give it a try?

668
00:44:31,354 --> 00:44:31,955
What?

669
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:32,893
A test.

670
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:33,823
A test?

671
00:44:34,127 --> 00:44:35,518
You call the wrong number on purpose.

672
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:36,409
I see.

673
00:44:37,799 --> 00:44:38,682
What are you going to do?

674
00:44:38,893 --> 00:44:40,260
We can tell who it is by the answer.

675
00:44:40,478 --> 00:44:41,408
What if someone else answers?

676
00:44:41,604 --> 00:44:42,737
I'll say mother.

677
00:44:43,088 --> 00:44:43,854
You know the number?

678
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,057
It says here.

679
00:44:47,112 --> 00:44:48,057
Give it a try.

680
00:44:52,534 --> 00:44:58,370
3.2.1.2

681
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,604
2.4.5

682
00:45:06,636 --> 00:45:07,659
Calling.

683
00:45:09,815 --> 00:45:12,471
Hello, is this wife?

684
00:45:12,496 --> 00:45:14,386
Who is it?

685
00:45:14,893 --> 00:45:16,573
Hello?

686
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:17,378
Well.

687
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:18,675
Who is it?

688
00:45:19,439 --> 00:45:21,432
Is that Karasawa?

689
00:45:21,557 --> 00:45:22,393
Your name.

690
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,346
No, I'm not Karasawa.

691
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:28,292
She hung up.

692
00:45:30,486 --> 00:45:34,549
3.2.1

693
00:45:35,791 --> 00:45:37,611
Do you still call?

694
00:45:37,931 --> 00:45:41,720
2.4.5

695
00:45:44,088 --> 00:45:46,635
Is that Karasawa?

696
00:45:47,057 --> 00:45:48,830
No, I'm not Karasawa.

697
00:45:49,174 --> 00:45:49,861
Hello?

698
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,557
What's the hell?

699
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,299
She' so mad.

700
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,596
That's all.

701
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:20,841
What time are you coming home tomorrow?

702
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,661
I have a meeting at 12:00.

703
00:46:24,997 --> 00:46:27,388
I can stay till 2:00 p.m.

704
00:46:28,473 --> 00:46:31,473
We can relax.

705
00:46:38,104 --> 00:46:40,010
Nice moon.

706
00:46:50,046 --> 00:46:52,039
Hello, Kasahara here.

707
00:46:53,664 --> 00:46:56,109
Papa? Who?

708
00:46:59,585 --> 00:47:00,500
Wife.

709
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:01,679
Who?

710
00:47:02,515 --> 00:47:03,476
Well.

711
00:47:04,062 --> 00:47:05,179
I wondered.

712
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:10,320
She said papa was here.

713
00:47:11,382 --> 00:47:12,648
Hello?

714
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:17,210
Boya's papa.

715
00:47:18,187 --> 00:47:20,656
Who are you?
Oh wife.

716
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:23,966
I knew it.

717
00:47:25,224 --> 00:47:26,162
Like this?

718
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,021
Good acting skills.
Realistic.

719
00:47:28,201 --> 00:47:29,896
I'm good actress.

720
00:47:30,091 --> 00:47:32,904
Let's start lesson.

721
00:47:35,810 --> 00:47:38,427
Are you calling your house?

722
00:47:38,474 --> 00:47:40,982
You won't send me home?

723
00:47:43,639 --> 00:47:47,537
Are you all ready?

724
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,787
Here we go.

725
00:47:54,514 --> 00:47:56,303
What's the meaning of Papa?

726
00:47:57,076 --> 00:48:01,123
She was so rude.
She immediately hung up the phone

727
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,154
She's harassing you.

728
00:48:03,857 --> 00:48:05,568
But I got a weird letter the other day.

729
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:08,303
Let's go to the police station.

730
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:37,994
Stay like that.

731
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,240
Stop.

732
00:48:45,786 --> 00:48:46,622
Ikeya.

733
00:48:49,232 --> 00:48:50,536
Take this hand down a little bit.

734
00:48:53,052 --> 00:48:54,279
Step back.

735
00:49:16,718 --> 00:49:18,726
Turn around.

736
00:49:23,546 --> 00:49:24,804
How's this?

737
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:26,452
This is awesome.

738
00:49:28,543 --> 00:49:29,786
That's all.

739
00:49:31,746 --> 00:49:32,778
Thank you for your work.

740
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:34,559
Thank you for your work.

741
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:37,809
I hope you all keep up the good work tomorrow.

742
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:40,879
Excuse me.

743
00:49:42,473 --> 00:49:43,809
What do you think?

744
00:49:45,481 --> 00:49:46,918
Thank you for your work.

745
00:49:47,207 --> 00:49:49,387
Why not make the blue a little darker?

746
00:49:49,661 --> 00:49:51,809
Because it's weak compared to the feeling of the costume.

747
00:49:53,012 --> 00:49:54,028
Excuse me.

748
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:55,559
Are you busy?

749
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:57,801
Yeah, we're gonna go to the club now and do a little bit.

750
00:49:58,098 --> 00:49:59,200
Just a little bit.

751
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:05,933
What?

752
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:11,589
Watch out for my brother.
He's a playboy.

753
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:13,417
He's not.

754
00:50:13,604 --> 00:50:14,948
You think so?

755
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:16,050
Why?

756
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:19,652
Because he asked me to marry.

757
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:22,800
Really?

758
00:50:24,370 --> 00:50:26,417
Marriage is a word women love to hear.

759
00:50:26,714 --> 00:50:28,167
He's breaking up with his wife.

760
00:50:28,488 --> 00:50:29,995
Are you going to kick Wife out and marry him?

761
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:32,659
I wanted to talk to you about that.

762
00:50:32,901 --> 00:50:33,784
Is he serious?

763
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:35,167
Yes he is.

764
00:50:36,081 --> 00:50:37,003
He has a girl.

765
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:38,089
Really?

766
00:50:38,114 --> 00:50:40,675
Yes,
Hi Yoshino.

767
00:50:42,089 --> 00:50:42,940
What?

768
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:44,425
Where's Takuo?

769
00:50:44,479 --> 00:50:45,706
He's left.

770
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,550
I see.
He's gone for Otami?

771
00:50:49,575 --> 00:50:50,675
I have no idea.

772
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,808
Tamie used to be a friend of yours.

773
00:50:54,409 --> 00:50:57,058
I've heard that she owns an apartment building.

774
00:50:57,378 --> 00:50:58,495
Your daughter said.

775
00:50:58,636 --> 00:51:00,190
Renko?

776
00:51:00,628 --> 00:51:03,425
Denjiro,that's what he does, he blackmails the president to get pocket money.

777
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,448
And Renko did too.

778
00:51:05,526 --> 00:51:08,558
They are so terrible.

779
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,081
Where is that apartment located?

780
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:13,355
It is run by our president.

781
00:51:13,558 --> 00:51:14,737
Did you arrange it?

782
00:51:14,901 --> 00:51:18,862
No way.
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

783
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:22,606
She is very black-hearted.

784
00:52:12,999 --> 00:52:13,827
You.

785
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:17,390
What's wrong?

786
00:52:18,437 --> 00:52:20,601
I had business.

787
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:23,421
I'll be home as soon as I'm done.

788
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:44,663
This is for you.
This is for me.

789
00:52:55,649 --> 00:53:01,407
By the way, I'm going to ask you something.
And is it true that you're going to not give up your Wife?

790
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:07,868
Well, I'm the first to say it, in case you were wondering.
What have I been working so hard for?

791
00:53:07,985 --> 00:53:09,164
you lied to me?

792
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:10,133
I didn't.

793
00:53:10,158 --> 00:53:10,727
You did.

794
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:13,407
She said she was first.

795
00:53:13,625 --> 00:53:17,946
If you leave me, I will go to your house and kill myself by taking poison.

796
00:53:18,797 --> 00:53:22,266
I dedicated my life to you.
You are responsible.

797
00:53:22,594 --> 00:53:24,360
You have to.

798
00:53:25,196 --> 00:53:26,633
I know what I feel.

799
00:53:26,658 --> 00:53:27,649
Don't blackmail me.

800
00:53:27,735 --> 00:53:29,250
You told me to divorce her.

801
00:53:29,422 --> 00:53:30,602
Why you liked this woman?

802
00:53:31,047 --> 00:53:32,149
What do you mean?

803
00:53:32,946 --> 00:53:34,852
You're still kid.

804
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,688
You want money from him?

805
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:39,266
How did you know here?

806
00:53:40,211 --> 00:53:41,321
I looked it up in the phone book.

807
00:53:41,524 --> 00:53:42,539
I get it.

808
00:53:43,672 --> 00:53:46,328
Don't act weird.

809
00:53:46,985 --> 00:53:47,938
What do you mean?

810
00:53:47,977 --> 00:53:49,360
This is a fact.

811
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:52,188
You sent the letter?

812
00:53:52,321 --> 00:53:55,399
This is only thing you know.

813
00:53:57,391 --> 00:53:58,360
You have a baby?

814
00:53:59,797 --> 00:54:01,305
Do you want to find a reason to break up with me?

815
00:54:01,330 --> 00:54:02,977
Don't get me wrong.

816
00:54:10,188 --> 00:54:15,148
Don't stay there forever.

817
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:17,618
You have a woman.

818
00:54:17,985 --> 00:54:21,297
I came here to sort things out.

819
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:30,502
Come on.

820
00:54:33,088 --> 00:54:34,479
Say hello to your dad.

821
00:54:34,862 --> 00:54:35,870
Hello?

822
00:54:36,331 --> 00:54:37,346
Play there.

823
00:54:37,371 --> 00:54:39,807
Stay here.
She'll leave soon.

824
00:54:45,057 --> 00:54:46,338
What's the hell?

825
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,268
What?

826
00:54:49,534 --> 00:54:50,698
You did it.

827
00:54:52,276 --> 00:54:53,581
What's the hell?

828
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,289
Stop it....

829
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:01,391
Don't do that.

830
00:55:03,742 --> 00:55:05,141
Stop it....

831
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,085
Stop it....

832
00:55:15,132 --> 00:55:16,890
Stop it....
I'm leaving too.

833
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:19,530
You're not going to divorce her.

834
00:55:20,265 --> 00:55:22,531
Don't get me wrong.

835
00:55:23,773 --> 00:55:25,898
What are you talking about?

836
00:55:29,695 --> 00:55:30,742
Wait.

837
00:55:30,882 --> 00:55:32,179
Hey.

838
00:55:45,567 --> 00:55:50,426
So you have been threatening me with letters and phone calls?

839
00:55:50,863 --> 00:55:51,684
Well...

840
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:58,176
Did he threaten to extort money or goods from you?

841
00:55:58,285 --> 00:56:00,043
Not yet.

842
00:56:00,076 --> 00:56:05,238
So she have a purpose to send the letter.

843
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:08,184
She was complaining to you about something.

844
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:15,918
I was in bed, so I went out to run an errand.
I don't know about the letter.

845
00:56:16,887 --> 00:56:18,942
Sorry to make you trouble.

846
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:22,973
Well...so.

847
00:56:24,278 --> 00:56:25,848
That policeman is persistent.

848
00:56:26,223 --> 00:56:29,512
There was no need to call the police.

849
00:56:29,934 --> 00:56:34,598
Wife fell asleep today. I was worried.

850
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:38,106
What did you say at the police station?

851
00:56:38,817 --> 00:56:43,372
I told him Threatening phone calls and letters arrive

852
00:56:43,786 --> 00:56:45,051
What's the hell?

853
00:56:45,169 --> 00:56:47,583
I asked him to help me find the culprit.

854
00:56:47,630 --> 00:56:49,231
Did you think that was a threatening call?

855
00:56:49,341 --> 00:56:50,919
Do you know about the phone?

856
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:52,895
Bring it out.

857
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:57,219
Wait.

858
00:57:02,289 --> 00:57:05,500
Don't tell her about the phone.

859
00:57:05,525 --> 00:57:10,977
You said you wanted to pursue it further.

860
00:57:11,227 --> 00:57:13,274
Please don't take it too seriously.

861
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:16,766
You said you'd do more because she wouldn't leave.

862
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:20,367
We should be careful.

863
00:57:20,422 --> 00:57:22,946
It's none of my business.

864
00:57:25,179 --> 00:57:28,007
I think Shizu forced Baya to go to the police.

865
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,054
It could be.

866
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,772
She used Baya.

867
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:31,702
You're going to take out the enemy?

868
00:57:31,772 --> 00:57:32,569
No way.

869
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,452
Who will tell others about the shame of their husband?

870
00:57:35,477 --> 00:57:36,460
It's none of my business.

871
00:57:36,765 --> 00:57:37,522
You don't wanna involved it?

872
00:57:37,624 --> 00:57:38,819
I'm sick of it.

873
00:57:38,844 --> 00:57:39,788
Wait.

874
00:57:47,229 --> 00:57:57,072
But the case is too small to be a crime.
It's a big problem for you, but... the police can't arrest him yet.

875
00:57:58,619 --> 00:58:00,166
We'll look into it,

876
00:58:00,191 --> 00:58:02,431
thank you for your help.

877
00:58:14,245 --> 00:58:17,612
We're in trouble.
You can't go to the police station.

878
00:58:35,248 --> 00:58:38,858
No...

879
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,272
Why not?

880
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:10,047
Hi.

881
00:59:13,138 --> 00:59:15,060
We were rehearsing a play.

882
00:59:15,365 --> 00:59:16,716
Yes.

883
00:59:18,482 --> 00:59:22,325
Get up like you're doing right now and say.

884
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,146
Yeah.

885
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:29,872
I'm not loving you.

886
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:58,697
I don't want to meet with this person so please decline

887
01:00:03,147 --> 01:00:07,100
Takuo.
I heard you didn't come home last night.

888
01:00:08,077 --> 01:00:09,569
Whatever.

889
01:00:12,749 --> 01:00:14,264
You've been busy.

890
01:00:17,147 --> 01:00:18,866
Are you trying to get pocket money again?

891
01:00:18,891 --> 01:00:19,991
Please go to the dressing room quickly.

892
01:00:20,279 --> 01:00:21,232
I know but.

893
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:25,038
Nami came by this morning.

894
01:00:25,063 --> 01:00:25,788
About police box?

895
01:00:26,085 --> 01:00:26,765
I just heard.

896
01:00:27,085 --> 01:00:28,069
She's stupid.

897
01:00:28,483 --> 01:00:30,655
She told the police about her husband's scandal.

898
01:00:30,929 --> 01:00:33,022
I can't stand anymore.

899
01:00:33,374 --> 01:00:35,335
Women are completely out of control.

900
01:00:35,413 --> 01:00:36,640
They're just a bunch of assholes.

901
01:00:36,741 --> 01:00:40,421
I told my brother to sort it out first.
Then my brother says I'm wasting my pocket change.

902
01:00:40,515 --> 01:00:41,772
You're selfish.

903
01:00:41,937 --> 01:00:44,108
The best reason is that our personalities don't match.

904
01:00:44,499 --> 01:00:46,585
Then Sizuka is getting a divorce?

905
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,827
The house is a mess for her all year round, and I don't feel like going home.

906
01:00:49,852 --> 01:00:51,163
I hate it too.

907
01:00:51,671 --> 01:00:52,663
Yeah and that letter.

908
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,608
It will be documentary evidence.

909
01:00:54,069 --> 01:00:57,616
If you want documentary evidence, NAMI will write a lot for you.

910
01:00:58,179 --> 01:00:59,171
Because the same person.

911
01:00:59,196 --> 01:00:59,663
What?

912
01:01:00,069 --> 01:01:01,687
She said she was in trouble.

913
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:05,748
Who told them that?

914
01:01:06,007 --> 01:01:07,476
I didn't tell them.

915
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:10,702
Oh my god.
I'm leaving.

916
01:01:18,251 --> 01:01:19,087
Welcome.

917
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:20,720
Congratulations today!

918
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:21,783
Welcome.

919
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,548
Hi. here it is.

920
01:01:23,908 --> 01:01:25,056
Thank you very much.

921
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:33,530
I think that's a good place.

922
01:01:34,163 --> 01:01:34,913
Hey.

923
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:36,233
Me?

924
01:01:36,514 --> 01:01:37,397
Hato and Nami.

925
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:38,639
What?

926
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:45,723
It's gonna be tough.
Our bros wants you all to stay home when you're done.

927
01:01:46,082 --> 01:01:47,012
He's pissed.

928
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,051
He's gonna make us buy him dinner.

929
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:50,191
Why He's pissed?

930
01:01:50,285 --> 01:01:50,832
The letter.

931
01:01:52,418 --> 01:01:53,363
Denjiro

932
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:55,566
Come home as soon as you're done with Show.

933
01:01:56,270 --> 01:01:57,793
Do you want to go for a cup of tea?

934
01:01:58,934 --> 01:01:59,551
What do you think?

935
01:01:59,645 --> 01:02:00,871
It can't be helped.

936
01:02:01,387 --> 01:02:02,559
We should leave the house.

937
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:04,293
Yeah we can be free.

938
01:02:12,298 --> 01:02:13,634
The boss's Wife is here.

939
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:16,970
It doesn't matter.
Mari Ishikawa is here too.

940
01:02:17,205 --> 01:02:18,525
You shouldn't have come here.

941
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:22,666
It's a fight.
I told about the apartment.

942
01:02:22,783 --> 01:02:26,072
We just got the weekly paper reporters.
They said they went backstage.

943
01:02:26,330 --> 01:02:30,111
We took money from the boss.
We're splitting the money.

944
01:02:30,228 --> 01:02:31,774
Don't do anything reckless.

945
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:33,251
It was good that he had a child.

946
01:02:33,564 --> 01:02:36,291
How's your little boy doing with his real dad?
Is he still around?

947
01:02:36,392 --> 01:02:38,228
Yes he is.

948
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,559
Don't do that.

949
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:57,621
You seem to be taking something in.
I'll be with you in a moment.

950
01:02:57,793 --> 01:02:59,933
Please wait.

951
01:03:05,465 --> 01:03:06,394
Wife.

952
01:03:08,347 --> 01:03:10,121
A guest is waiting.

953
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:12,254
Tell my husband.

954
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,537
Husband.

955
01:03:25,248 --> 01:03:26,694
A guest is waiting.

956
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:28,592
Ask my wife.

957
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:30,741
Well...

958
01:03:31,225 --> 01:03:32,256
She'll meet her.

959
01:03:32,444 --> 01:03:37,209
She won't go because you're making her sit

960
01:03:37,709 --> 01:03:41,108
What?
What's a cooking school teacher to do with a man?

961
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:47,030
I don't know what's going on.

962
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:51,210
He said you should go.

963
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:56,623
I have no reason to leave this house.

964
01:03:56,648 --> 01:03:58,702
No.
See the guest.

965
01:03:58,741 --> 01:04:00,601
My husband told that?

966
01:04:00,626 --> 01:04:02,741
Please see her.

967
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:03,968
I see.

968
01:04:12,554 --> 01:04:13,351
Good afternoon.

969
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:19,046
Good afternoon.

970
01:04:20,947 --> 01:04:22,338
Oh Hina.

971
01:04:25,291 --> 01:04:27,150
How are you?

972
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:29,884
We're in big trouble.

973
01:04:29,909 --> 01:04:30,650
What's wrong?

974
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,908
Anyway come in.

975
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:36,025
I wanted to talk to you about something.
I brought you something.

976
01:04:36,416 --> 01:04:40,868
You don't have to do that.

977
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:42,752
Where's wife?

978
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:47,010
We're in big trouble.

979
01:04:47,267 --> 01:04:49,517
I don't know who will leave from here.

980
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:57,260
I'm tired now so I'm thinking of taking a little break.

981
01:04:58,455 --> 01:05:00,822
Leave the greetings for later

982
01:05:01,010 --> 01:05:02,627
I'll help you.

983
01:05:04,056 --> 01:05:06,783
Can you make me some of that dried bonito flakes?

984
01:05:08,671 --> 01:05:14,093
I am so tired of doing this.

985
01:05:16,147 --> 01:05:21,468
Is everyone in your family doing well?

986
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:22,319
Yes.

987
01:05:26,546 --> 01:05:30,054
If your sister is there, you two will move out of the house.

988
01:05:30,796 --> 01:05:31,890
Yes.

989
01:05:32,202 --> 01:05:33,241
Of course.

990
01:05:33,413 --> 01:05:34,944
What's more important, your siblings or strangers?

991
01:05:36,249 --> 01:05:40,999
You don't have to put up with anything you don't want to, either.

992
01:05:41,069 --> 01:05:43,546
Yes,
We did it out of the kindness of our hearts.

993
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:47,147
If it says in the letter that you have a child, I get alimony.

994
01:05:48,077 --> 01:05:49,804
You should wait until she says she wants to break up

995
01:05:49,882 --> 01:05:50,538
Yeah.

996
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:55,327
If the letter is a lie, you can just get angry later.

997
01:05:55,437 --> 01:05:56,288
If she checks, she will know

998
01:05:57,397 --> 01:05:58,882
You have a kid?

999
01:06:01,115 --> 01:06:02,506
Oh my god.

1000
01:06:02,803 --> 01:06:03,849
You're so bad.

1001
01:06:03,874 --> 01:06:04,834
He is being threatened by the woman.

1002
01:06:05,014 --> 01:06:05,936
really?

1003
01:06:07,826 --> 01:06:10,279
It's none of your business.

1004
01:06:10,811 --> 01:06:15,209
You're the reason this house is unstable.

1005
01:06:15,975 --> 01:06:18,967
We are very patient.

1006
01:06:20,006 --> 01:06:26,670
I am also very dissatisfied with the food in this house.

1007
01:06:27,092 --> 01:06:28,522
The fish dishes are also well cooked.

1008
01:06:28,733 --> 01:06:29,740
It tasted bad.

1009
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,444
There are also too many bean sprouts.

1010
01:06:32,349 --> 01:06:33,763
The potatoes are also burnt black.

1011
01:06:33,788 --> 01:06:34,810
She buys a lot of bad ingredients.

1012
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,381
That's how she save money.

1013
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:41,451
She's no good at cleaning and I don't want to stay here with her anymore.

1014
01:06:41,881 --> 01:06:43,826
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

1015
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,358
Are you still doing that?

1016
01:06:47,029 --> 01:06:51,608
What do you think?
I have a lot of friends who are better than her.

1017
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:53,553
I can take care of Bros

1018
01:06:53,889 --> 01:06:55,225
I feel same.

1019
01:06:57,920 --> 01:06:59,443
Are There Any People Like That?

1020
01:06:59,468 --> 01:07:00,404
Much better than Renko.

1021
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:01,912
She's terrible.

1022
01:07:01,937 --> 01:07:02,975
Mind your own business.

1023
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,311
I'll go through with it if I think it's good for me, no matter who it is.

1024
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,904
It's okay to have one pure-hearted person in the house.

1025
01:07:07,929 --> 01:07:09,529
What's the hell?

1026
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,334
Don't get jealous.

1027
01:07:11,990 --> 01:07:13,717
Pocket money, please.

1028
01:07:13,928 --> 01:07:14,404
No.

1029
01:07:14,444 --> 01:07:15,131
In your face.

1030
01:07:15,608 --> 01:07:18,358
I work part-time at a department store.

1031
01:07:20,863 --> 01:07:24,082
Anyway, I'll let you think about it.

1032
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:26,176
Let's go.

1033
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:30,207
We're going to get organized and move out of this house.

1034
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,145
Thanks.

1035
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:40,507
Please pick me up as soon as possible.

1036
01:07:46,757 --> 01:07:48,664
Thank you very much for taking the time to see me.

1037
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:51,359
We'll discuss it

1038
01:07:51,546 --> 01:07:53,999
Thank you very much.

1039
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:55,640
Thank you very much.

1040
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,277
Are you going to trip?

1041
01:08:23,302 --> 01:08:24,316
Don't pretend you don't know.

1042
01:08:25,238 --> 01:08:28,277
There is a good matchmaking.

1043
01:08:28,855 --> 01:08:29,425
For hato?

1044
01:08:29,581 --> 01:08:30,277
Which?

1045
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:31,706
Either.

1046
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,003
That's rude.

1047
01:08:36,068 --> 01:08:36,818
What's he like?

1048
01:08:37,373 --> 01:08:39,107
This is his résumé.

1049
01:08:40,302 --> 01:08:41,451
Sis.

1050
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:43,896
Let me see.

1051
01:08:50,788 --> 01:08:51,929
What are you doing?

1052
01:08:59,390 --> 01:09:01,484
Where are you going?

1053
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:03,210
I'm sorry to bother you.

1054
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,116
Where's my sis?

1055
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:06,491
Look at this.

1056
01:09:08,257 --> 01:09:10,437
Takehiko Oyabu?

1057
01:09:10,952 --> 01:09:13,249
He's a dentist and he's already running a business.

1058
01:09:13,288 --> 01:09:16,624
I'm a little concerned about the name Oyabu.

1059
01:09:16,921 --> 01:09:19,429
He does not care of her age.

1060
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:23,874
He's bit old,36.

1061
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:25,257
Not for Hatoko?

1062
01:09:25,437 --> 01:09:26,616
For Namiko.

1063
01:09:26,984 --> 01:09:30,406
I would like to find someone else for hatoko.

1064
01:09:30,531 --> 01:09:32,015
You marry him.

1065
01:09:32,108 --> 01:09:33,194
Yeah.

1066
01:09:33,523 --> 01:09:35,171
I don't hate marriage.

1067
01:09:35,445 --> 01:09:40,413
If you want to leave this house, you should marry into his family.

1068
01:09:40,898 --> 01:09:41,945
What do you mean?

1069
01:09:44,312 --> 01:09:47,733
Well, let's meet this guy.

1070
01:09:48,265 --> 01:09:49,866
This is good idea.

1071
01:09:50,546 --> 01:09:51,803
What are you doing?

1072
01:09:52,866 --> 01:09:54,960
You're betraying me

1073
01:09:55,609 --> 01:09:56,585
Hatoko.

1074
01:10:09,665 --> 01:10:10,837
Saeko.

1075
01:10:17,888 --> 01:10:19,083
Saeko.

1076
01:10:21,568 --> 01:10:22,576
She's not here.

1077
01:11:06,489 --> 01:11:08,715
Please gargle.

1078
01:11:09,910 --> 01:11:12,582
Then I'll treat your teeth.

1079
01:11:17,149 --> 01:11:18,938
I wanna see your face.

1080
01:11:19,969 --> 01:11:20,914
My face?

1081
01:11:22,844 --> 01:11:23,923
What's wrong?

1082
01:11:25,696 --> 01:11:27,134
Take care of this.

1083
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:30,071
How much does it weigh?

1084
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:32,048
About 10kg.

1085
01:11:33,719 --> 01:11:34,383
How much?

1086
01:11:34,594 --> 01:11:35,985
About 30yen.

1087
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:39,196
Thirty yen? That's pretty cheap.

1088
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,977
Don't cheat.

1089
01:11:43,002 --> 01:11:44,462
You're stingy.

1090
01:11:45,376 --> 01:11:46,782
Never mind.

1091
01:11:49,626 --> 01:11:53,110
She's selling all that stuff without permission while Wife is away.

1092
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:55,587
Let's finish this.

1093
01:11:55,829 --> 01:11:58,539
I'll say hello to wife.

1094
01:11:59,759 --> 01:12:04,516
She like to be called wife while she's away.

1095
01:12:04,899 --> 01:12:08,235
It's a complicated state of mind.
I don't know what to do.

1096
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,626
She sell them and buy a baked sweet potato.

1097
01:12:14,469 --> 01:12:21,610
They look forward to buying sweet potatoes when wife is not around.

1098
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,959
I feel sorry for their parents.

1099
01:12:40,252 --> 01:12:41,049
Oh.

1100
01:12:44,619 --> 01:12:46,088
Do you read this?

1101
01:12:47,197 --> 01:12:49,291
The Book of We the Workers.

1102
01:12:49,595 --> 01:12:50,705
Hina.

1103
01:12:51,627 --> 01:12:53,799
Please eat some.

1104
01:12:53,824 --> 01:12:56,525
Thank you very much.

1105
01:12:56,920 --> 01:12:59,428
I'll give you my clothes.

1106
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:03,764
I'm just helping her.

1107
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,881
She's got a different mother, doesn't she?

1108
01:13:08,303 --> 01:13:13,178
Since my daughter died, I've never been closer to her house.

1109
01:13:13,569 --> 01:13:15,858
We are like a stranger now.

1110
01:13:16,490 --> 01:13:17,975
for the train fare.

1111
01:13:18,139 --> 01:13:18,905
Thanks.

1112
01:13:18,983 --> 01:13:20,865
You received pocket money.

1113
01:13:22,531 --> 01:13:24,265
I come here part-time sometimes.

1114
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:29,586
But she buys these for me.

1115
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:31,109
This is good.

1116
01:13:31,484 --> 01:13:33,492
I append to find good one.

1117
01:13:36,126 --> 01:13:37,056
Wife is back?

1118
01:13:41,431 --> 01:13:43,173
She's back.

1119
01:13:46,353 --> 01:13:47,337
Welcome back.

1120
01:13:47,751 --> 01:13:48,775
Welcome back.

1121
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:50,173
I'm home.

1122
01:13:50,368 --> 01:13:53,111
I had dental treatment and my tooth hurts.

1123
01:13:53,142 --> 01:13:54,736
Take care.

1124
01:13:58,102 --> 01:13:58,852
How was he?

1125
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:00,719
He's very good. He's very kind.

1126
01:14:01,727 --> 01:14:03,954
Not that.

1127
01:14:07,923 --> 01:14:08,899
How was he like?

1128
01:14:09,024 --> 01:14:10,008
His face?

1129
01:14:10,516 --> 01:14:14,477
At first I thought he looked not good with a mask on, but then I thought he looked really good .

1130
01:14:16,008 --> 01:14:18,055
What do you think?

1131
01:14:19,305 --> 01:14:20,657
He's nice.

1132
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:26,930
He's too good for you.

1133
01:14:29,087 --> 01:14:34,860
He provides cheap dental treatment to his patients.

1134
01:14:35,126 --> 01:14:36,235
Why he does that?

1135
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:41,813
He charges high prices from the rich but not for poors.

1136
01:14:41,838 --> 01:14:43,071
Does he have a good reputation?

1137
01:14:43,336 --> 01:14:44,953
That's what the people who came said.

1138
01:14:45,008 --> 01:14:48,571
Don't you think everyone who doesn't come thinks he's good?
We'll have to ask those who don't come.

1139
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:51,680
That's why I asked at the grocery store.

1140
01:14:51,751 --> 01:14:55,461
He is an acquaintance of the dentist.
Have you asked other people?

1141
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,328
At Tobacconist.

1142
01:14:57,485 --> 01:14:58,891
He buy Tobacco too.

1143
01:14:59,266 --> 01:15:00,344
He doesn't.

1144
01:15:00,618 --> 01:15:01,610
Because he's a dentist?

1145
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:03,962
His teeth turn yellow so?

1146
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,923
I don't know.
He's healthy, anyway.

1147
01:15:07,626 --> 01:15:09,227
I wonder if he has a respiratory problem.

1148
01:15:09,430 --> 01:15:11,915
I don't think you're overreacting.

1149
01:15:12,548 --> 01:15:14,462
I think this is a very good offer.

1150
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:21,008
I think his dental clinic would be great if renovated.

1151
01:15:21,602 --> 01:15:24,493
I was surprised to find such a wonderful man.

1152
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:30,469
It would be wonderful if you guys could get married.

1153
01:15:30,552 --> 01:15:32,212
What do you think?
Do you like him?

1154
01:15:33,298 --> 01:15:35,045
I don't know yet.

1155
01:15:38,094 --> 01:15:38,894
You look happy.

1156
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:42,772
Do I have to wear g lasses?

1157
01:15:43,018 --> 01:15:43,665
Well.

1158
01:15:43,911 --> 01:15:46,911
Isn't it better to wear glasses from the beginning?
It's not right to do it on the way.

1159
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:57,852
Here it is.

1160
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:04,528
They are here.

1161
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,121
Thank you very much for your patience.

1162
01:16:17,722 --> 01:16:20,615
I'll introduce you right away.

1163
01:16:21,166 --> 01:16:22,573
This is Mr. Karasawa.

1164
01:16:23,683 --> 01:16:25,683
This is her sister,  Saeko.

1165
01:16:26,294 --> 01:16:27,327
I'm Saeko.

1166
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,715
This is Ms. Namiko.
And this is Mr. Oyabu.

1167
01:16:32,572 --> 01:16:34,205
I'm Oyabu.
Nice to meet you.

1168
01:16:56,013 --> 01:16:59,639
Why you care about his bald head?
What is the value of a man without hair?

1169
01:17:00,614 --> 01:17:06,041
If he has too much testosterone, he's bald.
I heard injecting female hormones would make some difference.

1170
01:17:06,123 --> 01:17:09,210
Why you didn't check his head in advance.

1171
01:17:09,485 --> 01:17:11,065
He wore a hat.

1172
01:17:11,309 --> 01:17:13,649
He was wearing a white surgical hat.

1173
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,088
That's the problem.

1174
01:17:15,145 --> 01:17:19,012
Isn't going bald at thirty-six the same as going bald at forty-five?

1175
01:17:19,130 --> 01:17:19,550
Yeah.

1176
01:17:19,876 --> 01:17:26,680
Better to know from the start that he's not going to go bald, than to lose his hair in the process of getting together.

1177
01:17:26,957 --> 01:17:31,050
There's no any dreams.
She goes on your honeymoon, and she's disappointed.

1178
01:17:31,178 --> 01:17:33,798
But she is not young too.

1179
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:37,235
Don't say that.

1180
01:17:44,649 --> 01:17:48,003
If our sister doesn't like bald men physiologically, you don't have to force her to marry him.

1181
01:17:48,168 --> 01:17:51,481
Rarely do people like physiological baldness.

1182
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:54,094
I feel sorry for her.
You're trying to get rid of her.

1183
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:58,582
I'm not just saying he's bald.

1184
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:03,093
I'm trying to reason with you because you have a problem with his baldness.

1185
01:18:03,986 --> 01:18:06,493
You all just want me to leave this house, don't you?

1186
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:08,610
I'm a trouble maker.

1187
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:13,060
Women have a lot of stress at home.
That's what's wrong with women.

1188
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:15,028
That's why I let you do whatever you want.

1189
01:18:15,765 --> 01:18:17,045
I'm taking care of you guys.

1190
01:18:17,524 --> 01:18:19,658
I made my marriage sacrificial.

1191
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:27,388
I have to work hard for this house when we get married.

1192
01:18:27,508 --> 01:18:28,542
That's wrong.

1193
01:18:28,757 --> 01:18:29,890
You don't know how I feel.

1194
01:18:30,194 --> 01:18:32,488
We want sincerity.

1195
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:38,728
Warmth and affection.
It's disgusting when it's done with formality.

1196
01:18:38,776 --> 01:18:42,810
You are sounds like Hitler.
He made human body lamp juice.

1197
01:18:43,649 --> 01:18:45,082
Showa Gruesome Tales.

1198
01:18:45,382 --> 01:18:47,309
We're talking seriously.

1199
01:18:49,849 --> 01:18:53,856
I don't have this kind of chance.
I've never had a serious discussion with our brother because he always runs away from us.

1200
01:18:54,325 --> 01:18:55,992
You're getting to the heart of the matter.

1201
01:18:56,592 --> 01:18:59,992
What do you mean by "you made marriage sacrificial."?

1202
01:19:00,313 --> 01:19:02,660
I can't help but feel that this is all my fault.

1203
01:19:03,289 --> 01:19:07,414
What does that have to do with me?
I'll fix what's wrong.

1204
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:10,719
What do you mean?
I can't make my own choices?

1205
01:19:10,744 --> 01:19:12,797
You sound cold.
I don't like your attitude.

1206
01:19:12,822 --> 01:19:16,211
That's why I'm trying so hard to be concerned about you.

1207
01:19:16,805 --> 01:19:19,993
You can't marry anyone by looking for flaws

1208
01:19:21,180 --> 01:19:25,547
You don't understand that I have been so patient and devoted to this day.

1209
01:19:26,493 --> 01:19:27,508
I'm sad.

1210
01:19:28,149 --> 01:19:30,289
The women at home are usually too selfish.

1211
01:19:30,493 --> 01:19:31,477
Men are too.

1212
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:34,305
You have no right to say that.

1213
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:38,203
I don't want you meddling in my private affairs.
My brother and I are different.

1214
01:19:38,868 --> 01:19:40,477
Don't talk shit about my girlfriend.

1215
01:19:41,453 --> 01:19:44,657
What do you think about Renko?

1216
01:19:44,899 --> 01:19:45,875
Not good.

1217
01:19:46,188 --> 01:19:48,368
Why don't you scold him?

1218
01:19:49,354 --> 01:19:54,119
I can't even get around to the men's side.
I'll have to start with the women and sort them out one by one.

1219
01:19:54,697 --> 01:19:57,088
It's very troublesome.

1220
01:19:57,143 --> 01:20:01,033
Are you telling me I'm wrong?
Are you taking me seriously?

1221
01:20:01,058 --> 01:20:06,658
The natural phenomenon of his lack of hair is beyond my control.

1222
01:20:07,752 --> 01:20:09,033
That's funny.

1223
01:20:12,111 --> 01:20:12,932
That's not funny.

1224
01:20:13,041 --> 01:20:15,776
Cut it out.

1225
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:19,346
I'm not just talking about his hair.

1226
01:20:19,479 --> 01:20:21,291
Don't get me wrong.

1227
01:20:21,408 --> 01:20:22,229
We don't.

1228
01:20:22,518 --> 01:20:30,088
You know, Mr. Oyabu, when he's alone with me, he's the first one to ask me how much I'm willing to pay for the renovation.

1229
01:20:30,354 --> 01:20:31,510
He's cheeky.

1230
01:20:31,713 --> 01:20:33,291
A deal and that's what he really wants.

1231
01:20:33,666 --> 01:20:37,893
He thinks I have money because I taught calligraphy until I was 30.

1232
01:20:38,221 --> 01:20:43,104
He said he wanted to use my money to renovate the clinic.

1233
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,346
He's going to marry an old woman so.

1234
01:20:45,690 --> 01:20:47,221
This is deal.

1235
01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,619
I'm still pure.
He's old too. 36.

1236
01:20:51,033 --> 01:20:54,557
Who told me he was great?

1237
01:20:54,798 --> 01:20:58,993
I didn't know about the renovation fund.

1238
01:20:59,018 --> 01:21:00,588
He told me that.

1239
01:21:00,613 --> 01:21:02,893
Dental treatment doesn't tell me much about his personality

1240
01:21:03,307 --> 01:21:04,338
What did you find out about him?

1241
01:21:04,548 --> 01:21:07,673
You are a very irresponsible person.

1242
01:21:08,065 --> 01:21:09,127
You know nothing about him.

1243
01:21:09,479 --> 01:21:10,158
Yeah.

1244
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:14,158
I also had to go to the trouble of getting my teeth treated.

1245
01:21:14,354 --> 01:21:17,651
I thought I did everything I could to remind you of your happiness.

1246
01:21:18,057 --> 01:21:19,838
What do you mean?

1247
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:20,838
I know you want us to leave here.

1248
01:21:20,863 --> 01:21:22,330
That's what you really want.

1249
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:25,572
Should I just keep quiet all the time?

1250
01:21:28,065 --> 01:21:29,940
Women's fight is scary.

1251
01:21:30,041 --> 01:21:31,752
I can't stand.

1252
01:21:31,979 --> 01:21:33,267
Don't let my bros say.

1253
01:21:33,799 --> 01:21:37,588
OK.
I'm not forcing you to marry him.

1254
01:21:37,713 --> 01:21:40,424
I'm so frustrated.

1255
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:45,502
Why don't you find someone you like?

1256
01:21:46,830 --> 01:21:52,330
You'll never find a better man than him.

1257
01:21:52,643 --> 01:21:54,088
What did you say?

1258
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:56,651
Don't say bad things about her.

1259
01:21:57,197 --> 01:22:00,276
What are you going to do with me?

1260
01:22:00,705 --> 01:22:02,244
Hit me.

1261
01:22:02,643 --> 01:22:04,307
Do whatever you want.

1262
01:22:05,135 --> 01:22:06,658
Stop it.

1263
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:09,775
I feel scary.

1264
01:22:11,306 --> 01:22:12,212
Good night.

1265
01:22:17,158 --> 01:22:18,009
Sit down.

1266
01:22:32,507 --> 01:22:33,382
Wife.

1267
01:22:35,710 --> 01:22:40,975
Please take a bath quickly.
The water in the bath gets cold

1268
01:22:42,117 --> 01:22:44,297
Ladies, in that order, please.

1269
01:22:44,774 --> 01:22:46,516
I'm not going to clean up.

1270
01:22:46,602 --> 01:22:47,930
You don't have to come in here and tell m

1271
01:22:48,039 --> 01:22:49,344
Fuel will be wasted

1272
01:22:49,414 --> 01:22:50,438
We have to take a bath?

1273
01:22:50,563 --> 01:22:52,031
I won't take a bath.

1274
01:22:52,367 --> 01:22:53,227
Ok.

1275
01:22:53,930 --> 01:22:54,766
Wife.

1276
01:23:07,406 --> 01:23:09,273
You guys go to bed.

1277
01:23:11,888 --> 01:23:13,255
Good night.

1278
01:23:16,505 --> 01:23:17,645
Let's go.

1279
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:06,000
It turns off.

1280
01:25:21,092 --> 01:25:22,592
2 mins?

1281
01:26:11,724 --> 01:26:13,942
He's not ok?

1282
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:28,354
Takuo.

1283
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,557
The doctor came by earlier and left.

1284
01:26:32,041 --> 01:26:34,315
He won't die.

1285
01:26:34,681 --> 01:26:36,939
What's wrong?
Gas poisoning

1286
01:26:37,190 --> 01:26:39,120
I don't know who did it.

1287
01:26:40,698 --> 01:26:44,159
I opened the gas valve.

1288
01:26:44,416 --> 01:26:50,518
But I had no intention of killing him and taking his fortune.

1289
01:26:51,229 --> 01:26:55,010
Let's leave this as your fault.

1290
01:26:56,018 --> 01:26:57,409
I turned it off.

1291
01:26:57,737 --> 01:26:59,518
This is attempted murder.

1292
01:26:59,698 --> 01:27:02,932
He was saved so don't blame her.

1293
01:27:03,284 --> 01:27:05,604
He'll be better if he rests for a few days.

1294
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:09,362
I was relieved to hear that.

1295
01:27:10,549 --> 01:27:15,307
I think God is punishing him.

1296
01:27:15,370 --> 01:27:18,284
I don't think God needs to do that.

1297
01:27:28,741 --> 01:27:31,233
Can I talk with you?

1298
01:27:32,476 --> 01:27:33,069
me?

1299
01:27:40,277 --> 01:27:41,793
What are you going to do about today's lesson?

1300
01:27:42,028 --> 01:27:44,645
Of course I'm taking the day off. I can't leave her like that.

1301
01:27:56,025 --> 01:27:57,299
is this?

1302
01:27:57,324 --> 01:27:59,009
Thank you very much.

1303
01:28:02,541 --> 01:28:08,447
Madam, sorry to say this.

1304
01:28:08,861 --> 01:28:11,002
I will quit this work.

1305
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:13,361
Why?

1306
01:28:13,736 --> 01:28:20,338
I'm scared I might get killed someday

1307
01:28:20,603 --> 01:28:24,400
There are so many problems in this house that I don't feel alive at all.

1308
01:28:24,627 --> 01:28:26,556
It's none of your business.

1309
01:28:26,798 --> 01:28:30,955
Someone might turn off the gas.

1310
01:28:31,118 --> 01:28:34,165
I don't want to take responsibility and go to jail.

1311
01:28:34,299 --> 01:28:36,400
Calm down.

1312
01:28:36,619 --> 01:28:41,368
There's been so much trouble in this house and I'm so fed up with it.

1313
01:28:41,401 --> 01:28:43,665
We need you.

1314
01:28:43,853 --> 01:28:46,493
My grandson came to see me last month.

1315
01:28:46,518 --> 01:28:50,166
Leave your talk for later.

1316
01:28:50,439 --> 01:28:54,478
Ok, please think about it.

1317
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:06,735
I'm stumped.

1318
01:29:07,946 --> 01:29:15,530
I'll have to think about it calmly.
There's no telling what kind of problems might arise in the future.

1319
01:29:16,523 --> 01:29:17,679
Are you breaking up with him?

1320
01:29:18,023 --> 01:29:18,515
Yes.

1321
01:29:19,601 --> 01:29:23,984
Talking to him will only make things worse between us.

1322
01:29:24,687 --> 01:29:30,570
But if there's even a shred of affection left in you, it's better than leaving and being lonely.

1323
01:29:31,398 --> 01:29:33,000
Don't let those girls get you down.

1324
01:29:33,025 --> 01:29:35,656
But, you know, there's a limit.

1325
01:29:36,718 --> 01:29:38,695
I'll think it over.

1326
01:29:39,133 --> 01:29:40,992
You don't live a very full life.

1327
01:29:41,461 --> 01:29:42,890
You're a good.

1328
01:29:46,204 --> 01:29:48,875
I don't expect anything from anyone.

1329
01:30:28,908 --> 01:30:29,783
I'm home.

1330
01:30:29,808 --> 01:30:32,212
Welcome back.
She left.

1331
01:30:32,783 --> 01:30:34,540
I see.
Where's bros?

1332
01:30:34,751 --> 01:30:35,978
He will be back by dinner time.

1333
01:30:36,072 --> 01:30:36,977
That's unusual.

1334
01:30:37,353 --> 01:30:39,165
Denjiro's bringing Renko again.

1335
01:30:39,228 --> 01:30:41,689
Do we have to prepare meals for her too?

1336
01:30:41,814 --> 01:30:43,994
It can't be helped.

1337
01:30:44,173 --> 01:30:45,392
Where's Baya?

1338
01:30:46,665 --> 01:30:48,931
Hina brought her boyfriend.

1339
01:30:48,956 --> 01:30:49,775
really?

1340
01:30:49,970 --> 01:30:51,884
They're going to work together and get married.

1341
01:30:53,212 --> 01:30:54,884
They will live with Baya in the future.

1342
01:30:57,212 --> 01:30:57,720
Tea.

1343
01:30:57,759 --> 01:30:58,751
I gave it to you earlier

1344
01:30:58,829 --> 01:30:59,392
I had it all.

1345
01:30:59,626 --> 01:31:01,072
I'm too busy.

1346
01:31:01,408 --> 01:31:02,361
I'm not asking.

1347
01:31:02,665 --> 01:31:04,728
Let Renko make it.
She's a woman.

1348
01:31:04,986 --> 01:31:06,876
The food is burning.

1349
01:31:11,702 --> 01:31:12,694
Oh my god.

1350
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,186
Put his water.

1351
01:31:15,264 --> 01:31:16,905
Don't use it.

1352
01:31:17,186 --> 01:31:18,514
It won't work.

1353
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,655
Say hello to them.

1354
01:31:23,683 --> 01:31:28,644
They're going to take me.

1355
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:29,449
I just heard.

1356
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:33,230
My name is Katou. Thanks for taking care of her grandmother.

1357
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:37,207
You act so quick.

1358
01:31:38,004 --> 01:31:39,995
They work same place.

1359
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:41,105
I just heard.

1360
01:31:41,566 --> 01:31:47,597
I sent them a letter the other day, and they came to me for advice.

1361
01:31:47,707 --> 01:31:49,355
They worried about me.

1362
01:31:50,347 --> 01:31:52,941
You look so happy.

1363
01:31:53,379 --> 01:31:56,840
I think they're going to have a hard time now.

1364
01:31:57,144 --> 01:31:58,472
Shall we leave?

1365
01:31:59,285 --> 01:32:01,488
Please take care of her grandmother.

1366
01:32:01,513 --> 01:32:02,590
Please…

1367
01:32:04,511 --> 01:32:06,332
They're going to look for an apartment now.

1368
01:32:07,543 --> 01:32:09,800
Why don't you walk her to the station?

1369
01:32:10,886 --> 01:32:12,496
Don't worry.

1370
01:32:12,605 --> 01:32:14,988
I don't want to get in their way.

1371
01:32:15,472 --> 01:32:17,004
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

1372
01:32:17,535 --> 01:32:18,504
Bye.

1373
01:32:25,482 --> 01:32:27,466
Have some ramen.

1374
01:32:28,864 --> 01:32:30,169
He's quite handsome.

1375
01:32:31,232 --> 01:32:32,989
You better find a good guy soon.

1376
01:32:33,794 --> 01:32:35,169
Don't get me started on them.

1377
01:32:40,264 --> 01:32:41,420
Don't say that.

1378
01:33:33,933 --> 01:33:34,840
I'm home.

1379
01:33:39,301 --> 01:33:41,504
Sizuka, you're awake?

1380
01:33:46,009 --> 01:33:46,798
Good morning.

1381
01:33:50,641 --> 01:33:52,196
You sleep really well.

1382
01:33:52,228 --> 01:33:53,603
I really do sleep well.

1383
01:33:54,282 --> 01:33:55,634
You must be exhausted.

1384
01:33:55,915 --> 01:33:57,525
I let you sleep in for a good Sunday.

1385
01:33:57,550 --> 01:34:01,157
I'm sorry, but I need to get some rest.

1386
01:34:01,235 --> 01:34:02,423
Have you made up your mind yet?

1387
01:34:03,407 --> 01:34:04,095
Go back to the country?

1388
01:34:04,353 --> 01:34:06,173
No.
I'll get a job.

1389
01:34:06,696 --> 01:34:08,478
That's a good idea.
Do you want some fruit?

1390
01:34:09,228 --> 01:34:12,665
I bought some.
Welcome.

1391
01:34:13,798 --> 01:34:15,712
Yes she's here.

1392
01:34:16,142 --> 01:34:16,767
Who?

1393
01:34:20,345 --> 01:34:20,923
hi.

1394
01:34:25,837 --> 01:34:27,493
Thank you for taking care of her.

1395
01:34:27,845 --> 01:34:28,376
Not at all.

1396
01:34:28,501 --> 01:34:30,485
This is a thank you for that.

1397
01:34:30,510 --> 01:34:31,165
Thanks.

1398
01:34:31,962 --> 01:34:33,314
Have you been over here all this time?

1399
01:34:33,767 --> 01:34:34,400
Yeah.

1400
01:34:35,798 --> 01:34:39,032
I was relieved.

1401
01:34:39,470 --> 01:34:43,477
It's a bit of a mess in here, please come in.

1402
01:34:43,782 --> 01:34:45,650
Thanks.

1403
01:34:49,674 --> 01:34:52,893
I've been having a lot of trouble lately.

1404
01:34:53,596 --> 01:34:58,885
Who decided what is a marriageable age?
I believe that people are always in their marriages.

1405
01:34:59,245 --> 01:35:03,315
The world is sad.
That's why they became neurotic.

1406
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:09,034
It has spread to us, and we are having a hard time.

1407
01:35:09,674 --> 01:35:13,456
A married couple can break up anytime they want to.

1408
01:35:13,792 --> 01:35:16,464
It's really that simple.

1409
01:35:18,065 --> 01:35:23,979
We've been cutting and re-cutting each other, and there's been no development at all.

1410
01:35:24,893 --> 01:35:30,112
We're trying to hold out until our sister calms down.

1411
01:35:30,854 --> 01:35:33,104
I'm sure you understand that.

1412
01:35:33,253 --> 01:35:34,557
I understand that.

1413
01:35:38,977 --> 01:35:44,618
Since I came all the way here to pick you up, let's go home before you cause too much trouble for her.

1414
01:35:55,623 --> 01:36:01,358
Actually, I wasn't half expecting you to show up.

1415
01:36:02,248 --> 01:36:04,068
Did you really think I was that heartless?

1416
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:07,240
It's not that.

1417
01:36:09,897 --> 01:36:11,279
Don't worry about us.

1418
01:36:16,123 --> 01:36:18,217
I can't go home now.

1419
01:36:18,514 --> 01:36:19,092
Why?

1420
01:36:19,248 --> 01:36:20,670
There's too much trouble in that house.

1421
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:22,584
Namiko and Hatoko are at the apartment.

1422
01:36:22,709 --> 01:36:23,873
Saeko's?

1423
01:36:24,475 --> 01:36:25,725
The apartment below her is about to become available.

1424
01:36:26,326 --> 01:36:30,420
We are thinking of selling our current house and moving to a smaller one.

1425
01:36:30,928 --> 01:36:32,693
I organize my surroundings in various ways.

1426
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:38,803
This is a nice neighborhood.
Why don't we go for a walk?

1427
01:36:44,154 --> 01:36:46,108
We are gonna go for a walk around the block.

1428
01:36:46,272 --> 01:36:46,693
I see.

1429
01:36:49,061 --> 01:36:50,404
We are going out for a bit.

1430
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:52,467
You.

1431
01:37:20,435 --> 01:37:32,365
THE END

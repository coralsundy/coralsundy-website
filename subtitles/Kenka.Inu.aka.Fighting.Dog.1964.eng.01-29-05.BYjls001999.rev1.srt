2
00:00:29,684 --> 00:00:33,145
What did you say?
Who is worse, those in prison or those on the outside?

3
00:00:33,457 --> 00:00:35,551
Of course it's worse for the people out there.

4
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:42,090
I have to back to work.
See you

5
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:04,116
The biggest problem I have with life here is the lack of women.

6
00:01:05,045 --> 00:01:07,741
I'm way too popular with the ladies out there.

7
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:09,483
It can't be helped

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:22,194
A Fighting Dog (Inu/Dog Series #2)

9
00:02:05,005 --> 00:02:05,958
Get out!

10
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:18,828
You will be punished later for this

11
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,476
Will you protect me?

12
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:23,289
By the way

13
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:25,328
You are about to release from prison

14
00:02:25,898 --> 00:02:27,070
Yes I am

15
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,515
I see

16
00:02:28,593 --> 00:02:30,804
If you want a tattoo, come to me

17
00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:31,851
Is there anything good?

18
00:02:31,876 --> 00:02:33,281
My wife will take care of you

19
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:34,671
What the hell?

20
00:02:34,796 --> 00:02:35,945
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:36,007 --> 00:02:37,390
Ok that's fine

22
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:42,437
I'm an idiot, so don't call me an idiot.

23
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:48,578
My wife loves handsome men

24
00:02:57,917 --> 00:02:59,175
Damn it

25
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,310
Bros!

26
00:03:05,006 --> 00:03:06,053
What are you doing to me?

27
00:03:06,146 --> 00:03:07,607
I feel so good

28
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,474
What are you doing?

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,200
Get out!

30
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:13,209
Why should I leave when he is taking a bath?

31
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:15,592
Get out anyway!

32
00:03:15,803 --> 00:03:18,006
You can take a bath

33
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,340
Enjoy having a bath!

34
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,052
Here it is

35
00:03:27,559 --> 00:03:28,911
Enjoy your meal

36
00:03:38,238 --> 00:03:40,371
We had a hard time

37
00:03:43,207 --> 00:03:45,035
It was Nice bath

38
00:03:45,722 --> 00:03:48,074
You all look difficult.
Get your meals.

39
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:50,871
My meal is small

40
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:53,027
This is bigger

41
00:03:57,691 --> 00:04:00,230
Don't we have a raffle for the meal?

42
00:04:00,589 --> 00:04:01,738
What the hell you are saying about?

43
00:04:02,183 --> 00:04:04,495
There is no such logic here.

44
00:04:04,838 --> 00:04:07,033
I eat anything whenever I want

45
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:09,416
I'm starving after working

46
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:18,206
Get lost from here

47
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:21,111
I can't see the rice because it's not well ventilated

48
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:25,150
What the hell you are!

49
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:41,582
Damn it!

50
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:43,402
Damn it!

51
00:04:52,694 --> 00:04:53,991
Damn it!

52
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:56,280
Damn it!

53
00:04:58,249 --> 00:05:00,882
We are eating

54
00:05:18,627 --> 00:05:21,494
Hey, you are good singer

55
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,885
Would you like to introduce an entertainment agency when you are released from prison?

56
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:26,440
Thank you very much

57
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:41,761
You shouldn't look at them too much

58
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,300
He was trading 1 box for 500 yen

59
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,392
What the hell?

60
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:59,441
Why do you guys hit me because I'm not doing anything

61
00:05:59,466 --> 00:06:01,441
Because your face is very easy to hit

62
00:06:01,466 --> 00:06:02,597
No way!

63
00:06:03,332 --> 00:06:05,941
Why do you hit him once a day?

64
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:08,699
If you hit him I will fight you guys

65
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:11,262
Are you sure to fight with me?

66
00:06:11,512 --> 00:06:12,910
Just bring it!

67
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:15,970
Fucking kid!

68
00:06:24,587 --> 00:06:25,892
Stop it...

69
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,948
Bros!

70
00:06:32,971 --> 00:06:34,104
Stop it

71
00:06:34,356 --> 00:06:35,661
This is for you

72
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:37,160
Thank you

73
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:38,973
Why did you get caught by the police?

74
00:06:39,231 --> 00:06:43,458
I was operating a fraudulent taxi.
I had a problem with a customer for a fee

75
00:06:44,505 --> 00:06:46,653
What is your relationship with Kamoi?

76
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:49,395
I have nothing to do with him

77
00:06:49,622 --> 00:06:52,028
Because he has a strong fight

78
00:06:52,835 --> 00:06:54,171
So I like him

79
00:06:56,163 --> 00:06:58,046
Hey stop fighting!

80
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,359
Stop !
Get back to work

81
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:07,420
Hey stop fighting!

82
00:07:07,654 --> 00:07:09,029
What are you guys doing?

83
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,342
I went crazy because there are no women here

84
00:07:11,367 --> 00:07:12,904
You guys should get together in the locker

85
00:07:13,193 --> 00:07:15,272
Do you preach us again?

86
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:16,576
126!

87
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:17,615
Yes

88
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,104
Good

89
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:24,307
98

90
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,029
Good

91
00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:33,029
I'm 256

92
00:07:36,170 --> 00:07:36,748
Good

93
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,123
Am I OK?

94
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:41,998
117

95
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:47,898
Good

96
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:52,869
Hey come here

97
00:07:53,135 --> 00:07:54,651
Hey 117

98
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,862
You

99
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,744
What? me?

100
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:00,675
What the hell this?

101
00:08:01,206 --> 00:08:02,143
What's this?

102
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:14,827
Today we were made a lot tougher

103
00:08:14,852 --> 00:08:18,547
But we were only extended from prison

104
00:08:18,594 --> 00:08:20,203
That's no problem

105
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:25,352
You helped me today as well

106
00:08:26,953 --> 00:08:27,844
What?

107
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:31,836
This is a cigarette

108
00:08:33,422 --> 00:08:34,914
Did you buy this from Komori?

109
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,429
I didn't.
I got it in secret

110
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,303
How can I make a fire?

111
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:41,974
Use here

112
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,842
You have a good idea

113
00:09:01,115 --> 00:09:02,123
It tastes good

114
00:09:02,232 --> 00:09:03,107
Really?

115
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:06,404
What's wrong?

116
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:08,029
Koichi

117
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:10,412
You are good man

118
00:09:12,295 --> 00:09:13,467
There is a smoke

119
00:09:15,771 --> 00:09:17,951
Give me it

120
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:25,907
Thanks

121
00:09:27,907 --> 00:09:28,954
You can smoke too

122
00:09:28,979 --> 00:09:30,055
Please make it

123
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,039
Smoke it

124
00:10:02,137 --> 00:10:03,090
Bros

125
00:10:03,652 --> 00:10:05,191
We should say good bye soon

126
00:10:05,387 --> 00:10:07,278
If you are out of jail, do your best

127
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:08,426
Thank you

128
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,715
Please come visit me when you are out of jail

129
00:10:13,973 --> 00:10:15,098
We're waiting for you

130
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:16,372
I will go if I feel like it

131
00:10:16,397 --> 00:10:17,872
Please come

132
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,781
I want to get a pistol

133
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,579
Ok.
Leave it to me

134
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:27,501
I know many vendors

135
00:10:31,243 --> 00:10:33,024
Out of jail...

136
00:10:34,548 --> 00:10:36,548
How many days am I left?

137
00:10:36,573 --> 00:10:37,947
I want to go out soon

138
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,123
Be quiet!

139
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:32,070
It's none of your business

140
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:36,179
Good singing

141
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:37,919
Good singing

142
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:40,419
Be quiet!

143
00:11:40,677 --> 00:11:41,841
Good singing

144
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,756
Stop doing it

145
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,366
Look at me, girl

146
00:11:51,575 --> 00:11:52,598
Look at me, girl

147
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,262
Look at me, girl

148
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:56,895
Be quiet!

149
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,754
I want to write a love letter for her

150
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,532
She's so nice

151
00:12:03,813 --> 00:12:06,407
You follow the rules of the prison

152
00:12:06,844 --> 00:12:07,766
Be quiet!

153
00:12:32,123 --> 00:12:34,561
She's so nice

154
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,995
Make a smile for me

155
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,728
I really like her!

156
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:57,589
Omachi!Omachi!

157
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:59,979
You're Omachi!

158
00:13:00,324 --> 00:13:01,683
When did you get out of jail?

159
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,128
I was released from prison long ago

160
00:13:04,153 --> 00:13:08,003
Shut up!
I had a lot of trouble because of you

161
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,488
I am very angry with you.

162
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:11,933
Don't get angry with me

163
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,722
Look at my car

164
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,097
Did you buy it?

165
00:13:18,122 --> 00:13:19,230
Yes I did

166
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:25,729
I hope you have reviewed me.

167
00:13:25,754 --> 00:13:27,003
Let's go

168
00:13:30,532 --> 00:13:31,602
What the hell you are doing?

169
00:13:32,673 --> 00:13:34,829
She's our woman

170
00:13:42,056 --> 00:13:43,181
Omachi!

171
00:13:43,876 --> 00:13:44,853
Omachi!

172
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:45,781
Omachi!

173
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:47,188
Don't call her casually

174
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:51,016
She'll be my wife.
Get out from here

175
00:14:03,432 --> 00:14:06,299
I wonder if my face is easy to be beaten

176
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,284
Bros, help me soon

177
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,953
Watch out!

178
00:14:16,547 --> 00:14:17,758
It was close

179
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,073
Outside the prison is really dangerous

180
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:23,955
It ’s safer to be in jail, is n’t it?

181
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:26,301
Let's go

182
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:43,460
Congratulations

183
00:14:44,296 --> 00:14:45,257
Who are you?

184
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:48,163
You are crazy

185
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,741
Please go first

186
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:55,317
You seem to have been very popular in jail

187
00:14:56,012 --> 00:14:57,926
Were you in the jail?

188
00:14:58,426 --> 00:14:59,699
I have never seen you

189
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:00,989
Why you know me?

190
00:15:01,014 --> 00:15:02,972
You're so popular

191
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:04,754
I was on Asahi newspaper?

192
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,504
I came to pick you up at the order of Mr. Komori

193
00:15:08,989 --> 00:15:09,973
Komori?

194
00:15:11,707 --> 00:15:13,114
What is he doing now?

195
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:14,364
He works in the construction industry

196
00:15:15,012 --> 00:15:17,582
He said he would bring you

197
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:19,965
There are a lot of sake and women

198
00:15:20,277 --> 00:15:21,222
I reject it

199
00:15:21,942 --> 00:15:26,903
I have a liquor allergy.
And I am too popular among women

200
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:28,786
See you then

201
00:15:41,202 --> 00:15:43,358
Hey cut it out

202
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:47,171
Ok, I'll follow you

203
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:48,327
Get in the car

204
00:15:48,694 --> 00:15:51,804
Don't order me.
Who the hell do you think you are?

205
00:15:51,890 --> 00:15:53,796
Open the door for me

206
00:15:54,382 --> 00:15:55,030
OK

207
00:15:57,992 --> 00:15:59,156
Get in the car

208
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:06,390
I've learned in the jail

209
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:07,871
See you then

210
00:16:32,829 --> 00:16:34,361
Wait!

211
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,020
Wait!

212
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:42,723
Run!Run!Run!

213
00:16:50,068 --> 00:16:51,232
Can I play this?

214
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:54,810
Bang bang!

215
00:16:56,071 --> 00:16:56,892
Bang bang!

216
00:17:15,331 --> 00:17:18,237
Long time no see

217
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,542
How are you?

218
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:22,011
How have you been doing?

219
00:17:46,884 --> 00:17:48,970
Oh bros!

220
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:51,095
How have you been doing?

221
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,431
Long time no see

222
00:17:52,541 --> 00:17:54,619
I was playing

223
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:56,275
You are working here

224
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,080
Who is he?

225
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:04,962
You came at the right time
He's a newspaper man.

226
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,564
I'm Sasaki from the Kansai newspaper

227
00:18:07,384 --> 00:18:10,290
We feature violence cases

228
00:18:11,392 --> 00:18:13,689
What do you mean?

229
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:15,326
A feature

230
00:18:15,802 --> 00:18:17,443
I see I see

231
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:21,052
He was victimized by a gang, but he won't tell me anything.

232
00:18:21,256 --> 00:18:24,068
I just got injured in this workplace

233
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,600
I know a gang hit you

234
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:28,412
I know what's on your mind

235
00:18:28,437 --> 00:18:29,240
No way

236
00:18:29,295 --> 00:18:30,670
He said no.
so Go home

237
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:31,646
But I know

238
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:35,467
I haven't had a long time with him so I want to talk to him

239
00:18:35,826 --> 00:18:36,443
Please go home

240
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:37,967
I see

241
00:18:38,526 --> 00:18:39,706
I'll visit you again

242
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,612
What happened to the wound

243
00:18:48,401 --> 00:18:50,643
I was waiting for you

244
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:55,315
I'm really happy that you came

245
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:56,870
That's too much

246
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,511
My dead mother said

247
00:18:59,276 --> 00:19:02,245
Use polite words for those you respect

248
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,792
Did your mother die?

249
00:19:04,003 --> 00:19:04,972
Yes

250
00:19:04,997 --> 00:19:05,776
She wrote to you

251
00:19:05,901 --> 00:19:09,425
She ate too much and died a few days after I was released from prison

252
00:19:09,573 --> 00:19:10,737
She ate too much ?

253
00:19:11,464 --> 00:19:13,120
Your mother wasn't very clever

254
00:19:13,253 --> 00:19:15,143
Because it ’s my mother

255
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:17,995
This is a really dirty story

256
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,479
Tell me about it

257
00:19:19,776 --> 00:19:24,784
I see that she died with her body straightened

258
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:28,916
Doctors and neighbors say she died of stomach cancer

259
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:31,089
They all said so

260
00:19:31,354 --> 00:19:34,104
I told them she didn't die of stomach cancer

261
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:39,213
She died upright, I said.
and they said I was crazy

262
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:40,511
They all said so

263
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:44,909
It's the name of the disease called stomach cancer

264
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:47,128
Oh I see.
I misunderstood

265
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:49,440
Is it the name of the illness

266
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:51,503
Oh ouch!

267
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,472
What did you do with the injury?

268
00:19:53,635 --> 00:19:57,612
I went to get my wife back

269
00:19:57,979 --> 00:20:00,206
Then they attacked me

270
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,768
You can ask your boss to help

271
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:05,737
My boss went to work somewhere else

272
00:20:06,097 --> 00:20:07,979
He left the car

273
00:20:08,112 --> 00:20:11,464
I want to work but now I can't because I have scratches

274
00:20:11,886 --> 00:20:14,456
I am really in trouble

275
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,948
I will work for you until you heal

276
00:20:19,347 --> 00:20:20,229
What should I do with my wife?

277
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:21,370
I'll get her back

278
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:25,237
You can't.
They are too strong

279
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,190
I want you to back her...but

280
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,183
They are strong so much?

281
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,284
Yes they are.
And they have pistols

282
00:20:35,528 --> 00:20:37,661
What?
Pistol?

283
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,168
Real one?

284
00:20:40,145 --> 00:20:42,489
I can't wait to go

285
00:20:44,308 --> 00:20:49,371
This bar is a bar based on the freedom of love

286
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,394
It is 450 yen per hour

287
00:20:51,519 --> 00:21:00,886
If you go from love to marriage and then divorce three hours later, that's your choice.

288
00:21:00,972 --> 00:21:02,589
Be quiet

289
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:09,082
I'm sorry that the noise around me has inconvenienced you.

290
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:13,050
Then I will come to the place you have designated.

291
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:18,175
I wear a dark gray suit with a white rose on my chest.

292
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:20,121
My name is Nishiguchi

293
00:21:20,628 --> 00:21:24,824
We deal with all kinds of women.

294
00:21:25,214 --> 00:21:27,871
Order whatever you like

295
00:21:28,425 --> 00:21:30,480
OK I get it

296
00:21:30,505 --> 00:21:32,144
I'll visit you soon

297
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:34,168
See you then

298
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:38,394
Be quiet while I'm on the phone.

299
00:21:39,472 --> 00:21:41,261
You are not educated

300
00:21:45,987 --> 00:21:47,307
Machiko,Let's go

301
00:21:47,362 --> 00:21:47,963
Me?

302
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:51,096
I don't want to pretend to be female student.
I was hit last time

303
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:52,783
I'm already 30

304
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:55,651
What the hell you are talking about?

305
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,698
Say you are ex female student

306
00:21:57,792 --> 00:21:59,236
Let's go for earn money

307
00:22:03,959 --> 00:22:05,577
What the hell, boss?

308
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:09,295
Do you properly report your sales?

309
00:22:10,256 --> 00:22:11,702
Yes I do

310
00:22:12,124 --> 00:22:15,749
Your sales ledger is fraudulent.

311
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:18,349
How did you know?

312
00:22:18,374 --> 00:22:19,967
You idiot

313
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,936
If you've done something wrong, be honest about it.

314
00:22:25,639 --> 00:22:27,475
I'm sorry I did it

315
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:33,987
What?
Tell me

316
00:22:34,425 --> 00:22:37,073
I bought this ring and I put in gold teeth.

317
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:38,151
This?

318
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:39,706
You idiot

319
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:43,892
Is it this back tooth?

320
00:22:43,917 --> 00:22:44,674
Yes

321
00:22:45,393 --> 00:22:47,783
Don't get carried away

322
00:22:48,885 --> 00:22:50,877
A man want to meet you

323
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,432
Give me a light

324
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:07,095
You have come here

325
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,290
You asked me to come here

326
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:15,048
You said you were asked by Komori to pick me up but what is your relationship with him?

327
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:18,150
He has something to do with my father

328
00:23:19,845 --> 00:23:22,056
Your small business partner?

329
00:23:22,212 --> 00:23:26,431
Ok I get it.
I know there is a woman called Machiko here

330
00:23:26,892 --> 00:23:28,173
I'm here to get her back

331
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,105
You want her back?

332
00:23:32,269 --> 00:23:35,269
Her husband is like my bros

333
00:23:35,949 --> 00:23:38,550
I feel sorry that his wife has run away

334
00:23:38,824 --> 00:23:40,597
Get her back

335
00:23:44,407 --> 00:23:45,110
Wait

336
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:48,298
Boss

337
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:50,056
Is he Kamoi,right?

338
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,876
He wants us to back her

339
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:54,962
Release her

340
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,009
Release her

341
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,392
What?

342
00:23:58,517 --> 00:23:59,360
Now!

343
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:02,907
You help her to return home

344
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:05,587
I get it

345
00:24:08,681 --> 00:24:09,689
Wait

346
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:12,907
What can I do for you?

347
00:24:14,142 --> 00:24:16,868
Sales are not good.

348
00:24:16,899 --> 00:24:19,235
We're doing well but It can't be helped

349
00:24:19,392 --> 00:24:21,016
You should work harder

350
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,001
If you say so...

351
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,798
Earn more!

352
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:27,497
Yes sir

353
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,497
Don't take time for one woman.

354
00:24:34,114 --> 00:24:35,794
You return or not?

355
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,059
We return

356
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,809
You're a man who knows what he's talking about.

357
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:44,262
Apart from this case, I want a pistol

358
00:24:44,778 --> 00:24:45,489
What?

359
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,731
We can't

360
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,997
I've brought her

361
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:55,114
Oh this handsome man is here to pick me up

362
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,012
Your husband is waiting for you

363
00:24:56,037 --> 00:24:57,598
I don't like him now

364
00:24:58,369 --> 00:24:59,619
Let's go

365
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:02,314
Long time no see, Kamoi bros

366
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:03,650
What the hell

367
00:25:03,791 --> 00:25:06,666
You are using this woman to do business.

368
00:25:06,691 --> 00:25:10,158
I don't mean that.
She got a cold, so I took care of her

369
00:25:10,713 --> 00:25:14,424
We'll return her.
Don't come here anymore

370
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:15,627
I know

371
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,650
Your husband is stupid, and you too

372
00:25:18,675 --> 00:25:21,174
Because I've been with him

373
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:23,267
Why do you laugh?

374
00:25:28,073 --> 00:25:29,511
I was waiting for you

375
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:30,706
Please get in the car

376
00:25:30,854 --> 00:25:32,198
Please get in the car

377
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:36,986
Please get on the front seat.
In other countries, only prostitutes and dogs ride in the back seat.

378
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,205
Please get in the car

379
00:25:39,025 --> 00:25:40,096
I want to go with you

380
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,158
We don't need you

381
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:42,275
Go home

382
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,572
What do you mean?

383
00:25:46,697 --> 00:25:47,892
Bros!

384
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:49,634
I want to go with you

385
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:50,861
See what I want

386
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:52,525
Can you go now?

387
00:25:53,283 --> 00:25:56,298
Your driver today is more handsome than usual,right?

388
00:25:56,323 --> 00:25:58,119
Yes.
You look like a foreigner

389
00:25:58,144 --> 00:26:00,845
I think so.
I look like a foreigner

390
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:02,773
I'll drive fast

391
00:26:05,859 --> 00:26:08,477
You are so mean.
You should give me train fee at least

392
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,039
Shall we go for a drink together?

393
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:12,664
Oh you

394
00:26:12,836 --> 00:26:14,023
This is your train fee

395
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:17,445
Thanks.
But I have nothing to do with gangs

396
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,570
Never mind.
Let's go

397
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:41,511
2000 YEN?
It costs a lot

398
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:48,398
She is so nice.
I really love her. Mimoza inn

399
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,119
2000 YEN?

400
00:26:53,268 --> 00:26:55,698
This is real 2000 YEN

401
00:26:56,658 --> 00:27:01,776
You know what.
I got 1000 yen, so you are twice handsome than I

402
00:27:01,801 --> 00:27:04,494
No way, he is 5-10 times handsome more than you

403
00:27:04,955 --> 00:27:06,056


404
00:27:06,205 --> 00:27:07,955


405
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,737
Wait

406
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:10,596
She's your wife

407
00:27:10,621 --> 00:27:13,346
Yes, but I have promised you

408
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,549
You take care of my wife after you leave from prison

409
00:27:16,698 --> 00:27:18,112
This is very democratic.

410
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,158
What the hell you are talking about?

411
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,182
Give me, I use this for pistol

412
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:23,057
You're so mean

413
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:25,385
You don't like me?

414
00:27:25,448 --> 00:27:27,010
I does not matter whether I like or not

415
00:27:27,198 --> 00:27:29,533
I like pistols more than women

416
00:27:30,563 --> 00:27:32,633


417
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:34,907
I can't live without pistol

418
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,594
Where can we find a pistol...

419
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:41,037
Oh, I have to go

420
00:27:41,085 --> 00:27:42,983
Where are you going?

421
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:50,568
You know where I can get pistols,right?

422
00:27:51,693 --> 00:27:53,779
Don't pretend you don't know

423
00:27:55,576 --> 00:27:56,334
You have?

424
00:27:56,388 --> 00:27:56,787
What?

425
00:27:56,857 --> 00:27:57,888
Do you have money?

426
00:27:58,334 --> 00:27:59,404
Are you kidding me?

427
00:27:59,709 --> 00:28:00,459
I have this much

428
00:28:00,623 --> 00:28:01,334
200000yen?

429
00:28:01,701 --> 00:28:02,013
No

430
00:28:02,146 --> 00:28:02,779
20000?

431
00:28:03,357 --> 00:28:03,787
2000?

432
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:04,669
That's right

433
00:28:04,888 --> 00:28:07,372
Are you kidding me?

434
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,107
It costs 30,000 to 50,000 wholesale and 100,000 retail.

435
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:12,459
Can I get a pistol at cheap price?

436
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:17,170
I'm sorry to say that you've become idiot after you sent to prison

437
00:28:17,428 --> 00:28:18,560
I'm sorry

438
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:22,084
Why not use the funds to gamble?

439
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:24,685
I believe you'll win

440
00:28:25,248 --> 00:28:27,896
Bet on it as I sign.

441
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:29,287
That's fake

442
00:28:29,795 --> 00:28:31,599
Don't be loud

443
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:37,896
I will send you a sign in secret.

444
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,779
Bet on it as I sign.

445
00:28:42,717 --> 00:28:44,349
Let's do it

446
00:28:55,657 --> 00:28:58,204
Bet,Bet,Bet

447
00:28:59,415 --> 00:29:01,040
Bet,Bet,Bet

448
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:02,993
Bet,Bet,Bet

449
00:29:04,968 --> 00:29:06,601
Bet,Bet,Bet

450
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:17,831
Bet,Bet,Bet

451
00:29:32,449 --> 00:29:34,793
Pay it,Pay it,

452
00:29:35,129 --> 00:29:35,918
Pay it,

453
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:37,316
Pay it,

454
00:29:37,426 --> 00:29:38,863
Pay it,

455
00:29:39,113 --> 00:29:40,839
Pay it,

456
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:43,675
Ok bed it

457
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:45,612
I'll give it a shot.

458
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:46,660
Are you sure?

459
00:29:46,685 --> 00:29:48,582
Take it!

460
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:53,044
Oh damn it

461
00:30:14,221 --> 00:30:15,713
Get together, guys

462
00:30:15,738 --> 00:30:17,065
Listen to me

463
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:19,916
3 meals with room, 850yen

464
00:30:19,941 --> 00:30:22,119
Do you want work?

465
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:25,096
850yen for work with 3 meals and room

466
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,283
What do you think?

467
00:30:27,316 --> 00:30:28,854
Get in the car

468
00:30:28,887 --> 00:30:30,424
I want work

469
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:32,588
We don't need a man like you

470
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:34,862
I know a man who work hard

471
00:30:34,893 --> 00:30:36,213
Who? bring here

472
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,510
This man

473
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:41,353
I see.
He looks better than you

474
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:42,588
Get in the car

475
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,924
You sure for 850yen?

476
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,713
Don't complain.
Get in the car now

477
00:30:47,283 --> 00:30:49,573
Ok, we close

478
00:30:50,244 --> 00:30:51,291
Thanks

479
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:52,557
Thanks

480
00:30:58,311 --> 00:30:59,741
This was easy money

481
00:31:01,654 --> 00:31:03,083
Get off the car

482
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,333
Thanks.
You just gathered these guys?

483
00:31:10,458 --> 00:31:12,067
It was hard

484
00:31:12,146 --> 00:31:13,075
Thanks

485
00:31:13,357 --> 00:31:15,146
I will take you over 8 guys

486
00:31:15,568 --> 00:31:17,185
8 guys are not enough

487
00:31:17,364 --> 00:31:19,927
We need 20 guys for the contraction work

488
00:31:20,036 --> 00:31:21,356
I'll bring more tomorrow

489
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,372
Don't worry

490
00:31:22,896 --> 00:31:24,364
Come here

491
00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:26,411
Come here now

492
00:31:33,945 --> 00:31:35,281
What are you doing?

493
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:41,764
I paid 350yen per person.

494
00:31:42,538 --> 00:31:45,632
Two escaped yesterday and three the day before yesterday.

495
00:31:46,312 --> 00:31:49,992
You are not in control of the situation.

496
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:50,991
It might be so

497
00:31:51,413 --> 00:31:53,804
But Someone could be working behind the scenes.

498
00:31:54,421 --> 00:31:57,570
They may be able to hook you up with a better deal than you'll find here.

499
00:31:57,687 --> 00:31:59,390
You think too much

500
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:01,999
If we lose one person, we won't be able to meet the construction deadline.

501
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,054
Our credibility will suffer.

502
00:32:05,538 --> 00:32:11,281
I think someone is trying to take our jobs and our turf.

503
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:13,617
You think too much

504
00:32:14,234 --> 00:32:16,140
I will find some more tomorrow

505
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:18,413
So don't worry.
Let's go

506
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,018
1.2.1.2

507
00:32:31,014 --> 00:32:32,694
You are doing your best at exercise

508
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:33,905
Do you like someone else?

509
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:37,013
What are you saying?
I'm just on a diet

510
00:32:37,646 --> 00:32:38,936
That's good for you

511
00:32:40,303 --> 00:32:41,287
What can I do for you?

512
00:32:41,312 --> 00:32:44,248
I just happened to stop here

513
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,531
A beautiful woman lives here, right?

514
00:32:48,742 --> 00:32:50,352
I need more detail

515
00:32:50,797 --> 00:32:52,711
She works in a place called Cabaret Manhattan

516
00:32:52,875 --> 00:32:56,726
She has clear skin and has a nice figure

517
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:59,969
That person is like an actress

518
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,281
Oh I know her

519
00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:03,828
She lives upstairs

520
00:33:03,853 --> 00:33:04,641
Thanks

521
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,774
Wait

522
00:33:05,938 --> 00:33:07,352
She's not here now

523
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:08,500
She's not here?

524
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:09,797
She's out for work

525
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:10,774
To where?

526
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,133
Hannan Branch of HOKO Bank

527
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:14,963
At bank?

528
00:33:15,213 --> 00:33:15,807
What is her name?

529
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,400
Yukari Marizawa

530
00:33:17,658 --> 00:33:18,697
What a good name

531
00:33:18,722 --> 00:33:19,455
Let's go

532
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,503
Oh I found her

533
00:33:26,652 --> 00:33:27,316
Hello?

534
00:33:28,863 --> 00:33:29,831
How are you?

535
00:33:33,745 --> 00:33:34,651
You know what

536
00:33:34,676 --> 00:33:37,455
If you want to make a deposit, please fill out the deposit form and come with your seal.

537
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:40,198
You are so cold.
We are not here to deposit

538
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,453
I want to talk to you

539
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,281
No private conversation is allowed during work.

540
00:33:44,562 --> 00:33:45,101
What?

541
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:47,726
No private conversation is allowed during work.

542
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:52,085
We shouldn't have a conversation with her, right?

543
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:53,507
It can't be helped

544
00:33:54,038 --> 00:33:56,734
I'll come back to the bar tonight

545
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,087
Let's go home together

546
00:34:07,681 --> 00:34:08,494
Thanks

547
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,856
I'm busy tonight

548
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,910
That man is waiting for you?

549
00:34:13,231 --> 00:34:14,731
Don't talk about that

550
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,012
It's OK

551
00:34:17,626 --> 00:34:20,087
You shouldn't be with a man like that

552
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,407
I think you can play with other men

553
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:24,173
Thank you for your advice

554
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,151
Lend me some money

555
00:34:28,346 --> 00:34:29,252
What's wrong?

556
00:34:29,307 --> 00:34:30,877
You had better go to work early

557
00:34:31,182 --> 00:34:32,095
I need money

558
00:34:32,119 --> 00:34:32,916
You can go

559
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:34,346
How much you have?

560
00:34:34,455 --> 00:34:35,361
I have 3 yen

561
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,194
Stupid.
Give me more

562
00:34:39,163 --> 00:34:43,522
Damn it.
Now she's waiting for me

563
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,640
I have an idea.
Why don't you pawn your suit?

564
00:35:06,859 --> 00:35:09,336
Stupid.
Dressing is very important

565
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:15,156
This is, after all, a legend from the olden days.

566
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:17,749
You can't understand even if you talk to you

567
00:35:17,898 --> 00:35:18,921
I can't sell my suits

568
00:35:19,015 --> 00:35:20,312
How do you prepare the money?

569
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:23,492
Freedom is really hard

570
00:35:23,984 --> 00:35:25,898
I'd better be in jail

571
00:35:28,862 --> 00:35:29,487
How many you have?

572
00:35:29,706 --> 00:35:31,534
1.2.3

573
00:35:32,112 --> 00:35:33,339
9yen

574
00:35:34,151 --> 00:35:35,659
9yen is not enough

575
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,675
I want to be energetic enough to have a fight

576
00:35:40,761 --> 00:35:41,612
Bros

577
00:35:42,214 --> 00:35:45,299
I can sell the car.
I don't even have the money to buy petrol so

578
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,745
Stupid.
That is important for you

579
00:35:49,395 --> 00:35:52,380
I will break up with you when I get a pistol

580
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:55,716
So keep the car

581
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,341
Thanks

582
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,497
It's so hot here and I'm going crazy

583
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,856
If I had my wife here, she would make money

584
00:36:05,052 --> 00:36:07,560
She doesn't come back for about five days after leaving home

585
00:36:08,982 --> 00:36:10,130
Tabako is gone

586
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,076
Where are you going?

587
00:36:12,101 --> 00:36:13,074
To bank

588
00:36:13,996 --> 00:36:16,082
Do you rob a bank?

589
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:18,769
I came to make a deposit

590
00:36:20,113 --> 00:36:21,214
I want to deposit 1 yen

591
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,191
Ok I'll take care of it

592
00:36:23,496 --> 00:36:24,863
please wait a little bit

593
00:36:26,152 --> 00:36:28,457
I make a passbook for the first time in my life

594
00:36:29,962 --> 00:36:32,673
I need money to date you

595
00:36:34,274 --> 00:36:36,298
Take your time and do your job.

596
00:36:38,712 --> 00:36:39,681
That dude

597
00:36:42,681 --> 00:36:43,759
Hey you!

598
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:45,712
I met you in a rare place

599
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,384
Get out of my way

600
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:47,587
I need to talk with him

601
00:36:47,612 --> 00:36:48,525
You bastard

602
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:49,618
Calm down

603
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:50,704
Help me

604
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,861
Let's go outside with me.
Let's solve the problem

605
00:36:54,618 --> 00:36:55,642
Ok

606
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:03,866
Wow! Pistol!

607
00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:08,632
This is cheap

608
00:37:09,241 --> 00:37:11,007
My homemade ones are better.

609
00:37:11,164 --> 00:37:12,242
Performance is pretty good

610
00:37:13,312 --> 00:37:16,109
Please fix the problem with this deal.

611
00:37:16,437 --> 00:37:19,664
Move him to the far side

612
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:21,929
That's as it should be.

613
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:25,718
But I don't know if this really works

614
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:29,224
This is a heavy trigger

615
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:32,654
I can only shoot one shot while my opponent has two shots

616
00:37:36,972 --> 00:37:38,277
But This is all right

617
00:37:40,137 --> 00:37:40,598
Take it

618
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:41,988
Thanks

619
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:43,715
See you

620
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,535
Wait

621
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:47,121
We have another problem

622
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:48,995
What's that?

623
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:50,801
Don't forget

624
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:53,168
That man's wife

625
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:57,825
I returned her because you told me to return

626
00:37:58,473 --> 00:38:00,066
She is his wife so

627
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:01,731
She is my subordinate

628
00:38:02,075 --> 00:38:04,160
I left her the bar job

629
00:38:04,942 --> 00:38:06,653
I want you to solve this problem

630
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:08,620
That's a very reckless request

631
00:38:08,645 --> 00:38:10,182
I'm saying right

632
00:38:10,854 --> 00:38:12,190
I owe you a debt.

633
00:38:14,858 --> 00:38:18,655
If I don't return her I have an idea

634
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,709
What kind of idea?

635
00:38:23,225 --> 00:38:25,116
Return that pistol

636
00:38:26,045 --> 00:38:26,764
No way

637
00:38:29,116 --> 00:38:31,358
Damn it!
Ok!

638
00:38:31,928 --> 00:38:35,483
I feel bad.
I will follow your request

639
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:39,889
Ok I made up my mind.
I want you to supervise the construction site

640
00:38:40,444 --> 00:38:42,608
I'll pay you a lot

641
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,795
So many good and bad things in life

642
00:39:14,434 --> 00:39:19,027
I wonder What is Yukari doing now?

643
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,320
It's too hot

644
00:39:28,921 --> 00:39:29,609
Hey

645
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,189
Are you Dokanshi?

646
00:39:32,526 --> 00:39:33,471
Wait

647
00:39:34,003 --> 00:39:35,370
What are you doing here?

648
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:40,557
I quit my job in jail and work here

649
00:39:41,065 --> 00:39:42,667
Did you do something wrong and get fired?

650
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,862
This is what I mean when I say that like attracts like.

651
00:39:47,487 --> 00:39:50,839
As you walk around I remember the prison

652
00:39:52,617 --> 00:39:53,984
What's wrong?

653
00:39:54,009 --> 00:39:57,539
I'm the director here. Greater than you

654
00:39:58,094 --> 00:39:59,875
So be careful

655
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:01,953
Damn it

656
00:40:03,953 --> 00:40:04,804
Go for it

657
00:40:06,015 --> 00:40:06,773
Go for it

658
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:12,362
Oh it's too hot

659
00:40:14,448 --> 00:40:15,581
What's wrong?

660
00:40:15,606 --> 00:40:16,628
Are you OK?

661
00:40:17,628 --> 00:40:20,558
Why are you working here?

662
00:40:21,146 --> 00:40:21,896
What?

663
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,294
Don't take a break without permission

664
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:27,669
Work hard!

665
00:40:27,715 --> 00:40:30,058
I reduce your salary

666
00:40:33,668 --> 00:40:39,824
It's dangerous to work someone you don't know

667
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:42,601
Dangerous things will happen soon

668
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,905
Anyway we are short of manpower

669
00:40:46,929 --> 00:40:51,858
A man named Kamoi is a very useful man

670
00:40:52,624 --> 00:40:54,351
You like him?

671
00:40:55,452 --> 00:40:57,991
He againsted you in jail

672
00:40:58,843 --> 00:41:01,905
He is a very gutsy man

673
00:41:02,663 --> 00:41:03,507
I see

674
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:08,061
However, your dog may bite your hand.

675
00:41:08,413 --> 00:41:09,874
Please be careful

676
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:17,808
He likes Yukari

677
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,847
Thank you for your kindness

678
00:41:23,975 --> 00:41:25,561
Hey!
Come on!

679
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:30,475
Go straight and turn right and the car will be waiting

680
00:41:31,163 --> 00:41:32,327
Wait

681
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:35,367
Go!

682
00:41:41,647 --> 00:41:42,421
Kamoi-san!

683
00:41:42,671 --> 00:41:43,906
They are running away

684
00:41:44,421 --> 00:41:45,335
Catch them!

685
00:41:48,054 --> 00:41:48,976
Wait!

686
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,009
Wait!

687
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:02,548
Wait!

688
00:42:03,846 --> 00:42:04,761
Wait!

689
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:12,769
Wait!

690
00:42:13,355 --> 00:42:14,456
Wait!

691
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,792
Get in the car!

692
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:23,639
Damn it

693
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:25,655
I have seen him before

694
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,425
Hey!

695
00:42:36,081 --> 00:42:38,401
What the hell you did it!

696
00:42:38,426 --> 00:42:40,456
I'm sorry.
I won't run away next time

697
00:42:41,295 --> 00:42:42,670
You are stupid

698
00:42:43,576 --> 00:42:46,037
Why did you try to escape?

699
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,623
Don't look down us

700
00:42:51,821 --> 00:42:56,290
Do you guys have a job but have any complaints?

701
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,798
You guys also have a place to sleep

702
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:02,673
Salary is not 850 yen

703
00:43:03,149 --> 00:43:04,837
But The take-home pay is only 350 yen

704
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:10,970
You guys are at least paid

705
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,315
Accommodation charges will be deducted from your salary

706
00:43:16,526 --> 00:43:20,565
Are you making fun of us?

707
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:29,595
Your job is as simple as carrying stones

708
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:30,806
Wait

709
00:43:31,658 --> 00:43:34,923
Who supports you

710
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:38,916
tell us!

711
00:43:40,986 --> 00:43:42,041
I have no idea

712
00:43:43,002 --> 00:43:43,580
You?

713
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:45,255
I have no idea

714
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,470
They don't know

715
00:43:48,495 --> 00:43:50,306
The car was parked.

716
00:43:51,174 --> 00:43:53,018
I have seen him before

717
00:43:53,643 --> 00:43:55,822
He was at the Shirayurikai

718
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:57,869
What?
You know him?

719
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,272
He looked a lot like him, I just said.

720
00:44:02,858 --> 00:44:06,673
I may have made a mistake

721
00:44:09,236 --> 00:44:13,260
Listen.
Reduce your salary

722
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:15,398
I don't do such a terrible thing

723
00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:22,394
We will provide you with food and accommodation information but Salary payment is postponed

724
00:44:23,105 --> 00:44:26,261
I work for them because I hear I get paid right.

725
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:27,754
You bastard

726
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:32,760
It's no wonder they want to run away

727
00:44:33,197 --> 00:44:37,447
Because the salary of 850 yen is 350 yen

728
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,189
They haven't heard that accommodation and meals are deducted

729
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:43,041
kamoi

730
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,377
Very thin bed and poor food

731
00:44:47,658 --> 00:44:49,604
I understand that you all want to run away.

732
00:44:49,629 --> 00:44:50,127
Shut up!

733
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:55,189
If you don't want them to run away, treat them better.

734
00:44:55,533 --> 00:44:59,111
If so, no one will run away

735
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:02,791
You guys think about that

736
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:16,332
Why do you guys keep quiet

737
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:18,082
Go back work!

738
00:45:26,405 --> 00:45:27,280
Where are you going

739
00:45:27,967 --> 00:45:29,600
It's none of your business

740
00:45:33,083 --> 00:45:34,849
Follow me

741
00:45:35,661 --> 00:45:37,669
Can you let him say what he wants to say?

742
00:45:39,637 --> 00:45:42,106
Why not use a whip for them

743
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:44,411
I know

744
00:45:46,591 --> 00:45:48,614
Don't get carried away

745
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,599
Oh you

746
00:45:54,739 --> 00:45:55,575
Is my leg injured okay?

747
00:45:56,161 --> 00:45:57,520
You are good at speaking

748
00:45:58,645 --> 00:45:59,981
You made one mistake

749
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:01,309
What?

750
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:05,224
The company pays 1200 yen per person

751
00:46:06,341 --> 00:46:06,974
1200yen?

752
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:10,278
He pinches 350yen from 1,200yen

753
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:16,731
You are such a pathetic man working for him.

754
00:46:17,505 --> 00:46:18,075
What?

755
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:20,161
Say again

756
00:46:20,255 --> 00:46:21,825
I can say as many times as I want

757
00:46:22,567 --> 00:46:25,856
You are a really embarrassing man

758
00:46:36,129 --> 00:46:39,481
I did a weird job

759
00:46:40,121 --> 00:46:41,285
I'm really upset?

760
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:42,582
Do you quit your job?

761
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:47,723
I still have something to do.
About you too

762
00:46:49,321 --> 00:46:52,149
Can I play with you tonight?

763
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:53,977
I'm playing with you now

764
00:46:54,002 --> 00:46:57,087
I mean, on the bed

765
00:47:03,468 --> 00:47:06,078
Don't get angry with me

766
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:10,898
I have never slept with a woman since I was out of jail

767
00:47:11,179 --> 00:47:13,515
There are many women in Japan

768
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,812
You have no mood

769
00:47:14,837 --> 00:47:17,968
I'm an honest man

770
00:47:19,187 --> 00:47:21,171
But my mother is with me now

771
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:24,570
Oh your mother is with you?

772
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,437
She will be back in a few days

773
00:47:27,101 --> 00:47:29,429
You should take good care of your mom

774
00:47:29,898 --> 00:47:31,406
I have no mother

775
00:47:32,234 --> 00:47:37,898
I went to jail because I got into a fight with a group of DAIKO who tried to destroy my mother's grave.

776
00:47:38,612 --> 00:47:41,714
I see.
You're so sweet

777
00:47:42,558 --> 00:47:45,152
I'm glad you understand me

778
00:47:45,597 --> 00:47:47,316
I want a drink

779
00:47:47,808 --> 00:47:49,394
You drink too

780
00:47:52,105 --> 00:47:53,839
I can't forgive that dude

781
00:48:06,177 --> 00:48:08,646
I was waiting for you

782
00:48:10,091 --> 00:48:11,716
You back home late

783
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:13,835
Please eat this

784
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:16,898
I've been drinking a lot

785
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:24,620
You got a pistol?

786
00:48:24,675 --> 00:48:26,331
I finally got it

787
00:48:26,519 --> 00:48:27,191
Good for you

788
00:48:27,277 --> 00:48:29,269
I can't live without this

789
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:33,597
By the way, what your husband do now?

790
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,167
He is a taxi driver now

791
00:48:36,058 --> 00:48:39,261
I was worried about his work

792
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:42,027
He looks like an idiot but he's pretty smart

793
00:48:42,652 --> 00:48:47,378
He contacted the police and took him home for free

794
00:48:48,456 --> 00:48:50,081
He's so smart

795
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:56,300
In addition, he was allowed to eat for free at the police

796
00:48:56,730 --> 00:49:00,488
I think he's really smart

797
00:49:01,324 --> 00:49:04,925
He might think that way because he's stupid

798
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:08,636
He's back

799
00:49:08,661 --> 00:49:09,246
Oh right

800
00:49:09,271 --> 00:49:10,207
Why did he knock on the door

801
00:49:11,019 --> 00:49:12,246
Come in

802
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:13,761
I'm Gamo

803
00:49:15,808 --> 00:49:17,473
Why you've come here?

804
00:49:24,019 --> 00:49:24,512
What's wrong?

805
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:29,582
I'm angry with your attitude.
So I can't sleep

806
00:49:31,246 --> 00:49:32,621
Can you go out with me?

807
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:36,762
Sure

808
00:49:53,582 --> 00:49:57,793
This is a very quiet place

809
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:05,277
By the way.
I hear You were dumped by Yukari

810
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:08,152
I didn't want to get in the way of taking care of his mother

811
00:50:08,293 --> 00:50:11,488
She has no mother.
She's lonely

812
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,941
I see

813
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:18,027
I guessed her weakness

814
00:50:19,996 --> 00:50:23,215
Actually Yukari is Komori's woman

815
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,887
I see. His woman

816
00:50:28,246 --> 00:50:30,644
So Komori is his mother

817
00:50:31,246 --> 00:50:32,793
It can't be helped

818
00:50:33,683 --> 00:50:37,613
The only way to get her is to kill  Komori

819
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:40,426
I would not want to rough them up like that.

820
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:44,582
Love is free.
She will approach me later

821
00:50:45,051 --> 00:50:47,113
It is guaranteed by the Constitution

822
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,019
I am confident

823
00:50:49,044 --> 00:50:50,605
You are confident

824
00:50:51,113 --> 00:50:52,535
I can support you

825
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,965
What you said at work is correct

826
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,230
That man is so black-hearted.

827
00:51:00,816 --> 00:51:01,527
kamoi

828
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,284
If you kill him, that organization will be ours

829
00:51:06,417 --> 00:51:08,308
We can share the benefit

830
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:11,206
You think very well

831
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:14,167
He is more black-hearted than Komori

832
00:51:15,988 --> 00:51:18,956
You are also pinned 350 yen

833
00:51:20,706 --> 00:51:25,839
You make me kill him.Then you call me the police.And you get Yukari-san

834
00:51:26,596 --> 00:51:27,784
I know everything what's on your mind

835
00:51:27,823 --> 00:51:28,855
What?

836
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:36,284
You are trying to kill him and get even greater profits

837
00:51:36,511 --> 00:51:39,948
You really have a bad personality

838
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:44,659
I will break up with KOMORI after the deal

839
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,566
It doesn't matter to me what you and KOMORI are like

840
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:48,902
Anyway

841
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:04,769
You are good at shooting.
Can I borrow it?

842
00:52:05,589 --> 00:52:06,668
Light?

843
00:52:32,613 --> 00:52:36,785
I will always reimburse you for any damage to the lighter.

844
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:38,683
Then see you

845
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:59,878
Are you out of home?
Are you out with your mom?

846
00:53:01,918 --> 00:53:03,207
I'll visit you again

847
00:53:11,785 --> 00:53:13,371
He's stupid

848
00:53:15,964 --> 00:53:18,652
Word hard!

849
00:53:19,878 --> 00:53:24,855
Humans work better than machines.

850
00:53:25,003 --> 00:53:27,230
Yes you are right

851
00:53:30,597 --> 00:53:32,824
I want to talk with you.
So come to locker

852
00:53:58,230 --> 00:53:59,753
Choose what you like

853
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:04,371
This is so great

854
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,035
It's same type of mine

855
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:09,910
How did you get this?

856
00:54:09,935 --> 00:54:11,285
Somewhere in south

857
00:54:11,441 --> 00:54:13,293
You can use this if you clean up

858
00:54:14,261 --> 00:54:18,824
I used to sell these, but had to stop because of a police investigation.

859
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,761
There is no one else to give it to but you.

860
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,246
You are so kind

861
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:30,347
But I would like to hear your terms of exchange.

862
00:54:31,207 --> 00:54:33,535
Can you kill Gamo?

863
00:54:33,964 --> 00:54:35,480
That's what I thought

864
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:41,964
I need to say, I like to play pistols but don't like to kill people

865
00:54:43,027 --> 00:54:48,362
Killing people is not worth my job.

866
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:53,121
If you kill Gamo, I will leave to manage the night bar to you

867
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:59,261
If I kill Gamo, I know you will kill me

868
00:54:59,636 --> 00:55:02,136
You all have the same idea.

869
00:55:03,652 --> 00:55:04,972
Gamo asked you?

870
00:55:05,027 --> 00:55:06,511
I have no idea

871
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:12,050
You might as well kill him yourself.

872
00:55:12,324 --> 00:55:14,808
You have many henchmen.

873
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:18,410
You can use your pistol better than GAMO.

874
00:55:19,425 --> 00:55:26,019
You kill him, you free the girls in the club too.

875
00:55:26,550 --> 00:55:28,628
You are so kind

876
00:55:29,355 --> 00:55:34,418
I don't want a used woman.

877
00:55:34,636 --> 00:55:35,315
I decline it

878
00:55:35,340 --> 00:55:36,527
What did you say!

879
00:55:38,144 --> 00:55:43,113
I only keep our first promise.

880
00:55:44,527 --> 00:55:46,675
And moreover about Gamo

881
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,214
He also love Yukari

882
00:55:51,003 --> 00:55:52,769
So watch out him

883
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:00,887
Bring Gamo

884
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:08,541
Listen, 5 guys escape

885
00:56:08,752 --> 00:56:09,549
5 guys

886
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:12,627
When I give you the signal, run and run.

887
00:56:13,041 --> 00:56:13,776
Don't be panicking

888
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:15,237
I get it

889
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:18,979
1,2,3,4 bills

890
00:56:29,013 --> 00:56:30,614
Work hard!

891
00:56:49,361 --> 00:56:52,079
They are escaping!
Catch them!

892
00:56:53,501 --> 00:56:54,814
Wait!

893
00:57:01,237 --> 00:57:02,964
Wait!

894
00:57:09,084 --> 00:57:10,631
Wait!

895
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:16,537
Wait!

896
00:57:25,076 --> 00:57:26,279
Leave it to me

897
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,967
You damn it!

898
00:57:32,502 --> 00:57:34,150
You should hide!

899
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:37,907
What the hell?

900
00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:39,556
3 people for now

901
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,009
Oh they are coming!

902
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:44,228
Wait!

903
00:57:44,314 --> 00:57:45,783
Hurry up!

904
00:57:47,916 --> 00:57:49,259
Damn it!

905
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:50,978
Oh my god

906
00:57:53,411 --> 00:57:54,700
What the hell!

907
00:57:55,614 --> 00:57:57,544
You are fucking dude!

908
00:57:57,569 --> 00:57:58,997
Don't get violence to me

909
00:58:00,972 --> 00:58:01,652
Boss

910
00:58:02,222 --> 00:58:02,808
This guy

911
00:58:02,933 --> 00:58:03,886
Bring him

912
00:58:04,292 --> 00:58:05,066
Me?

913
00:58:05,331 --> 00:58:06,410
There's no one but you

914
00:58:10,308 --> 00:58:11,792
Bring them too

915
00:58:11,817 --> 00:58:13,511
I will take care of this guy

916
00:58:14,128 --> 00:58:14,917
Yes sir

917
00:58:15,246 --> 00:58:16,308
Come here

918
00:58:16,464 --> 00:58:19,253
What are you doing to me?
I was just asked by someone

919
00:58:20,026 --> 00:58:21,354
Who asked you?

920
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:23,417
I can't tell

921
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,613
I can't breath.
Let me go

922
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:38,425
Oh you

923
00:58:38,785 --> 00:58:40,902
He's just henchman

924
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:43,988
The master is elsewhere.

925
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:45,847
I tried to ask him for it!

926
00:58:46,746 --> 00:58:47,628
Why you killed him?

927
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,183
I tried to stop him

928
00:58:52,392 --> 00:58:56,267
I think KAMOI is doing this.

929
00:58:56,767 --> 00:58:57,720
Kamoi?

930
00:58:58,189 --> 00:58:59,447
What's wrong?

931
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:02,088
I heard gun sounds

932
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:06,931
He was leading them.

933
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:13,025
Kokichi

934
00:59:16,486 --> 00:59:17,095
Kokichi

935
00:59:17,994 --> 00:59:18,728
Kokuchi

936
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,603
Say something

937
00:59:22,611 --> 00:59:23,306
Kokuchi

938
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,223
Kokuchi

939
00:59:33,434 --> 00:59:35,207
He's died

940
00:59:35,426 --> 00:59:36,504
He's died

941
00:59:39,815 --> 00:59:45,729
You look peaceful.

942
00:59:50,127 --> 00:59:51,119
You're stupid

943
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,675
Who killed him?

944
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,956
I ordered.
Do you have anything to complain about?

945
01:00:07,161 --> 01:00:11,356
He had nothing to do with it

946
01:00:12,591 --> 01:00:14,130
You shouldn't have killed him

947
01:00:14,255 --> 01:00:17,145
You used him to escape workers

948
01:00:17,801 --> 01:00:22,841
What?
You've changed your mind?

949
01:00:24,153 --> 01:00:25,966
A friend today may turn against you tomorrow

950
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:34,223
I definitely didn't take advantage of him.

951
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:40,964
Do you think I won't fight back against you people?

952
01:00:42,456 --> 01:00:46,175
I can fight you at any time!
Bring it on!

953
01:00:47,964 --> 01:00:52,808
I hate the guy who used him

954
01:00:54,269 --> 01:00:57,011
I work here until I find the guy

955
01:00:57,558 --> 01:00:58,979
Don't pretend you are great

956
01:00:59,933 --> 01:01:00,948
Shut up!

957
01:01:03,237 --> 01:01:10,456
He gave me the cigarette he was hiding in his underwear

958
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:20,026
I'm very sorry

959
01:01:40,222 --> 01:01:41,808
I hear Kokuchi was died

960
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,683
You're down in the dumps.

961
01:01:48,011 --> 01:01:51,440
No way.
I'm so upset

962
01:01:52,354 --> 01:01:53,214
You keep quiet?

963
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:55,886
Yes, I'm just looking

964
01:01:56,745 --> 01:02:00,433
Your nerves must be completely paralyzed.

965
01:02:01,644 --> 01:02:03,175
You don't seem to be human

966
01:02:03,284 --> 01:02:04,487
Shut up!

967
01:02:05,714 --> 01:02:09,878
My nerves are different from you

968
01:02:44,025 --> 01:02:46,065
Sing good!

969
01:02:46,338 --> 01:02:47,963
Do you remember me?

970
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:51,150
You drink a lot tonight

971
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:54,886
I am mad for the first time in a long time.

972
01:02:55,378 --> 01:02:56,332
What happened?

973
01:02:57,652 --> 01:03:03,386
What?
What do you think of me?

974
01:03:04,050 --> 01:03:04,839
I don't think I hate you

975
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:08,050
So you mean you love me

976
01:03:10,192 --> 01:03:13,239
I'm going to your house tonight

977
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:16,263
Did your mother go home?

978
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,903
She returned this morning

979
01:03:19,114 --> 01:03:20,731
She boarded the plane for the first time in her life

980
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:22,536
Oh by plane

981
01:03:22,794 --> 01:03:27,083
I think your mother will be very happy.
You did good job

982
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,833
You did something really good

983
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:43,324
Please enter as it is not locked

984
01:03:50,608 --> 01:03:51,694
Thank you

985
01:03:53,225 --> 01:03:54,983
Have you been waiting for me?

986
01:03:56,936 --> 01:03:57,702
Come in

987
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,870
Have a seat

988
01:04:15,699 --> 01:04:18,277
I hear you are very respectable.

989
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,051
Me?

990
01:04:19,168 --> 01:04:21,598
You are different from me

991
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:22,832
Don't say that

992
01:04:22,857 --> 01:04:26,340
I seriously think so

993
01:04:29,207 --> 01:04:32,715
You are Komori's woman, right?

994
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:35,324
Right?

995
01:04:37,381 --> 01:04:39,724
Don't pretend you don't know

996
01:04:40,178 --> 01:04:42,295
You deceived me

997
01:04:45,167 --> 01:04:48,847
If you're a man I'm hitting you

998
01:04:49,222 --> 01:04:51,230
I didn't want to fool you

999
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,988
He told me to keep you in his group

1000
01:04:57,230 --> 01:04:59,683
I don't want to hear your excuse

1001
01:05:01,746 --> 01:05:05,324
You thought I was surprised about komori?

1002
01:05:05,863 --> 01:05:10,418
I like you regardless of him

1003
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:19,322
Are you shedding tears?

1004
01:05:20,205 --> 01:05:22,854
I want to apologize to you

1005
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,877
It's too late

1006
01:05:27,002 --> 01:05:29,150
My friend was killed by him

1007
01:05:30,283 --> 01:05:36,752
My friend had a really bad time

1008
01:05:38,609 --> 01:05:42,078
I want to get revenge for him

1009
01:05:56,027 --> 01:05:57,472
Damn it!

1010
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,379
Damn it!

1011
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:02,692
Damn it!

1012
01:06:03,231 --> 01:06:04,317
Damn it!

1013
01:07:00,037 --> 01:07:02,662
It's already morning

1014
01:07:07,077 --> 01:07:12,999
I will fight Gamo and Komori from now on

1015
01:07:14,275 --> 01:07:16,611
Don't go.
It's danger

1016
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:19,994
You should run away from Osaka

1017
01:07:20,019 --> 01:07:21,033
I can't

1018
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:26,080
I have a relationship with you so I have to fight with him

1019
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:30,221
I have never escaped in my life

1020
01:07:38,194 --> 01:07:40,670
What will happen to me if you fight him?

1021
01:07:40,695 --> 01:07:43,358
I have no idea.
Up to you

1022
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:48,452
I see.
I'll be free

1023
01:07:49,522 --> 01:07:52,147
Yes that's right

1024
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:58,015
I hate him so I fell in love with you

1025
01:07:58,927 --> 01:07:59,724
You lair

1026
01:08:00,724 --> 01:08:02,778
It's up to you.

1027
01:08:04,271 --> 01:08:09,575
Don't look at me like that.
I fell in love with you

1028
01:08:16,087 --> 01:08:20,853
He has something to do with other gangsters.
Do you think about it later?

1029
01:08:21,189 --> 01:08:22,228
They will revenge you

1030
01:08:22,253 --> 01:08:23,946
I don't think I'm after it.

1031
01:08:25,368 --> 01:08:31,196
Even if they attack me, the fact is that KOKUCHI is dead.

1032
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:38,635
I need more pistol bullets

1033
01:08:40,102 --> 01:08:41,165
It can't be helped

1034
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:47,368
One pistol bullet is enough for me.

1035
01:08:48,696 --> 01:08:49,423
Good

1036
01:08:52,446 --> 01:08:54,274
See you then

1037
01:08:55,134 --> 01:08:55,970
Wait

1038
01:08:56,774 --> 01:08:57,626
What?

1039
01:09:17,218 --> 01:09:19,390
Please back home safe

1040
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:22,249
I don't know what will happen

1041
01:09:31,295 --> 01:09:32,209
pistol bullets!

1042
01:09:39,867 --> 01:09:40,624
It's match!

1043
01:09:42,140 --> 01:09:45,046
This is enough

1044
01:09:52,364 --> 01:09:53,098
bet

1045
01:09:54,754 --> 01:09:55,543
bet

1046
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:01,054
Hey! where's Komori?

1047
01:10:01,273 --> 01:10:02,632
He's outside

1048
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,414
You should bet here

1049
01:10:07,621 --> 01:10:09,739
You're not good at gambling

1050
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:12,871
That's right

1051
01:10:12,996 --> 01:10:14,707
How is it?

1052
01:10:14,934 --> 01:10:17,059
You're the winner

1053
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:18,973
Ok got it

1054
01:10:21,561 --> 01:10:24,710
You lost

1055
01:10:25,546 --> 01:10:26,960
Shut up!

1056
01:10:27,185 --> 01:10:27,968
You wanna play?

1057
01:10:27,993 --> 01:10:32,813
I hate card games like this

1058
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:36,000
I like games like this

1059
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:37,897
What the hell

1060
01:10:39,256 --> 01:10:42,100
Kokuchi is my friend

1061
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:43,022
Who's kokuchi?

1062
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:46,155
He was killed by Komori

1063
01:10:46,725 --> 01:10:52,530
I want to kill him but first of all I will attack you guys

1064
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:12,507
Why you are here?
Don't get in the way!

1065
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:14,256
You can save time

1066
01:11:14,765 --> 01:11:17,296
You help me

1067
01:11:17,335 --> 01:11:18,570
Anyway thanks

1068
01:11:31,646 --> 01:11:32,701
Here we go!

1069
01:11:45,715 --> 01:11:46,848
Wait!

1070
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:11,378
They are bullshit

1071
01:12:12,706 --> 01:12:15,113
Did you see my ability?

1072
01:12:16,292 --> 01:12:18,714
You run away somewhere

1073
01:12:19,324 --> 01:12:22,113
I'll be back.
What you will do?

1074
01:12:22,331 --> 01:12:24,621
I'll beat Komori and Gamo

1075
01:12:25,488 --> 01:12:26,753
But before doing it

1076
01:12:26,785 --> 01:12:27,535
Yukari?

1077
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:30,065
How do you know?

1078
01:12:30,535 --> 01:12:31,691
I am a newspaper reporter

1079
01:12:32,464 --> 01:12:33,542
You like her,right?

1080
01:12:33,746 --> 01:12:34,941
I'll support you

1081
01:12:36,199 --> 01:12:37,214
You're so kind

1082
01:12:37,652 --> 01:12:38,972
But don't worry

1083
01:12:40,269 --> 01:12:43,050
Don't kill them, Ok?

1084
01:12:43,761 --> 01:12:45,253
You're so kind again

1085
01:12:45,699 --> 01:12:50,050
I don't want to go back to jail anymore

1086
01:12:50,128 --> 01:12:51,136
You should go

1087
01:12:51,628 --> 01:12:52,175
See you

1088
01:12:53,855 --> 01:12:57,089
Don't tell the police until my work is done

1089
01:12:59,936 --> 01:13:00,951
Take care

1090
01:13:12,972 --> 01:13:13,582
What?

1091
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:22,060
Kamoi kills komori
Komori kills Kamoi, so we are left

1092
01:13:25,932 --> 01:13:29,971
I love you from the beginning

1093
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:32,895
You seem to have a romantic relationship with Kamoi

1094
01:13:33,801 --> 01:13:37,598
The two of us will end up in a romantic relationship

1095
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:42,479
Don't pretend to hate me

1096
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:46,307
I won't let kamoi give you

1097
01:13:54,281 --> 01:13:55,180
Stop it

1098
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:56,453
Yukari!

1099
01:13:57,430 --> 01:13:58,094
Stop it

1100
01:13:58,992 --> 01:13:59,961
Gamo!

1101
01:14:00,406 --> 01:14:01,297
Hey!

1102
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,086
What are you doing?

1103
01:14:12,622 --> 01:14:14,551
You killed Kokuchi

1104
01:14:15,864 --> 01:14:18,394
And you try to rob my girl

1105
01:14:19,394 --> 01:14:22,261
I won't be fooled by you anymore

1106
01:14:22,722 --> 01:14:23,433
What?

1107
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:26,120
I have some advice for you

1108
01:14:26,722 --> 01:14:28,573
She is yous

1109
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,402
Do you trust me?

1110
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:33,441
I have proof

1111
01:14:38,378 --> 01:14:39,831
It's dangerous

1112
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:41,933
It's dangerous

1113
01:14:43,667 --> 01:14:48,089
I have eyes on my back

1114
01:14:48,712 --> 01:14:50,884
Stay away

1115
01:14:52,337 --> 01:14:55,251
Tell them I won't run away

1116
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:59,306
Tell Kaneda to wait at the construction site

1117
01:15:00,282 --> 01:15:02,181
That's all.
You go now

1118
01:15:03,407 --> 01:15:05,493
I have a temper with a pistol.

1119
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:35,787
Where did the stupid KOKUCHI go

1120
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:41,084
Where did the stupid KOKUCHI go

1121
01:15:42,311 --> 01:15:47,897
I really miss him

1122
01:15:48,897 --> 01:15:53,389
I want him to come back soon

1123
01:15:54,748 --> 01:16:00,358
Where did the stupid KOKUCHI go

1124
01:16:01,569 --> 01:16:07,061
Where did he go

1125
01:16:24,842 --> 01:16:26,647
Does he really come?

1126
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,131
I'm sure he'll come

1127
01:17:16,412 --> 01:17:17,686
Don't move

1128
01:17:19,139 --> 01:17:21,475
If you move, I'll kill everyone

1129
01:17:26,428 --> 01:17:29,967
Maybe there is a rat in the house

1130
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:32,913
Listen to me

1131
01:17:33,624 --> 01:17:36,171
I have a temper with a pistol.

1132
01:17:36,679 --> 01:17:39,819
I can drop you into hell

1133
01:17:40,218 --> 01:17:42,569
Are you ready?

1134
01:17:46,827 --> 01:17:48,327
It's no use shooting me too

1135
01:17:48,772 --> 01:17:50,538
You just waste your Handgun bullets

1136
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:52,038
Gamo!

1137
01:17:58,312 --> 01:17:59,140
Kill him!

1138
01:18:07,376 --> 01:18:10,087
Even if you shoot a lot, it won't hit me

1139
01:18:12,079 --> 01:18:13,329
Oh my god

1140
01:18:43,843 --> 01:18:46,483
It's very fast.
I recommend you to the Olympics

1141
01:18:47,210 --> 01:18:51,069
Stupid!
How many guys we have!

1142
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:57,679
Hey,what's wrong?

1143
01:18:58,741 --> 01:18:59,913
Come on,Komori and Gamo!

1144
01:19:01,257 --> 01:19:05,077
I have business with them both alone.

1145
01:19:06,312 --> 01:19:06,983
Oh

1146
01:19:25,925 --> 01:19:27,816
Escape from here!

1147
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:34,886
Don't do bullshit!

1148
01:19:35,752 --> 01:19:37,330
Escape from here!

1149
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:42,252
Escape from here!

1150
01:19:57,720 --> 01:19:58,759
Escape from here!

1151
01:20:17,246 --> 01:20:19,347
You bustard!

1152
01:20:21,347 --> 01:20:22,605
You bustard!

1153
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:33,169
Kokichi

1154
01:20:34,052 --> 01:20:37,287
I have taken your enemies.

1155
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:43,880
The fire engine came earlier than I expected

1156
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:46,982
I shot the other guy so he wouldn't die.

1157
01:20:47,630 --> 01:20:49,919
Take a rest for a whole

1158
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:53,419
See you then

1159
01:21:11,853 --> 01:21:15,338
Have the Tenchi Group and GAMO Group been over?

1160
01:21:15,768 --> 01:21:17,244
The police are investigating now

1161
01:21:17,728 --> 01:21:20,283
Because it's their job

1162
01:21:24,503 --> 01:21:25,652
Why are you crying?

1163
01:21:27,753 --> 01:21:29,574
Because I'm glad

1164
01:21:30,183 --> 01:21:31,894
I end up to be free now

1165
01:21:32,402 --> 01:21:33,167
That's right?

1166
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:39,136
But we are dangerous to be here

1167
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:42,113
We should move the place

1168
01:21:44,628 --> 01:21:46,050
We can't be together?

1169
01:21:48,128 --> 01:21:49,495
Let me stay with you

1170
01:21:50,863 --> 01:21:53,441
It's ok but You will have a hard time

1171
01:21:54,339 --> 01:21:55,222
Really?

1172
01:21:56,136 --> 01:21:56,980
Take me

1173
01:21:57,097 --> 01:22:01,730
But I don't have a job

1174
01:22:02,144 --> 01:22:03,769
You must be prepared.

1175
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,050
Never mind

1176
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:10,863
I don't want to live in bondage.

1177
01:22:14,089 --> 01:22:14,722
I see

1178
01:22:16,566 --> 01:22:17,769
Do you really love me?

1179
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:24,300
You are really woman.
Because Women all over the world like me

1180
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:29,863
We should take a rest

1181
01:22:30,503 --> 01:22:31,690
The sun will soon rise

1182
01:22:32,089 --> 01:22:34,933
I'm tired because I've been playing westerns

1183
01:22:44,011 --> 01:22:44,824
What's wrong?

1184
01:22:46,542 --> 01:22:47,566
Come here

1185
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,410
The phone is noisy

1186
01:23:28,386 --> 01:23:29,035
Hello?

1187
01:23:30,027 --> 01:23:30,894
Oh you

1188
01:23:31,863 --> 01:23:35,370
How did you find here?

1189
01:23:37,003 --> 01:23:38,933
You will write a special article

1190
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:41,652
What?

1191
01:23:43,155 --> 01:23:51,366
I just received new information.
Komori and others are chasing you and your woman

1192
01:23:52,334 --> 01:23:53,467
Are you with her now?

1193
01:23:54,233 --> 01:23:56,288
What?
None of my business?

1194
01:23:57,311 --> 01:24:00,999
You are with the woman.
You guys are in big trouble if they find you.

1195
01:24:01,889 --> 01:24:03,741
You're okay, but the woman will be killed

1196
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:06,483
Leave the gun and the woman and leave the hotel quickly.

1197
01:24:07,530 --> 01:24:10,147
It's for the women

1198
01:24:12,389 --> 01:24:16,006
If you have a pistol, you will be in violation of the law due to illegal possession.

1199
01:24:16,374 --> 01:24:18,506
And I'm worried because you might kill someone

1200
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:22,030
Leave the gun and the woman and leave the hotel quickly.

1201
01:24:22,717 --> 01:24:23,936
You get it?

1202
01:25:13,319 --> 01:25:15,092
Don't be like a thief

1203
01:25:17,709 --> 01:25:18,702
You realised

1204
01:25:21,785 --> 01:25:23,942
You told me to take me out

1205
01:25:25,754 --> 01:25:26,801
I'm not lair

1206
01:25:29,379 --> 01:25:32,621
I'd better not be on your side

1207
01:25:32,903 --> 01:25:36,246
So you would be in big trouble if I were here.

1208
01:25:37,171 --> 01:25:39,578
I don't mean that

1209
01:25:41,789 --> 01:25:46,140
I don't want to be with Komori anymore

1210
01:25:46,390 --> 01:25:47,367
I want to escape

1211
01:25:48,890 --> 01:25:50,070
Don't get me wrong

1212
01:25:51,874 --> 01:25:53,468
You’re free now

1213
01:25:53,929 --> 01:25:55,734
Enjoy on your own

1214
01:25:57,976 --> 01:25:58,703
Right?

1215
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:02,445
You know what

1216
01:26:03,687 --> 01:26:08,914
You shouldn't be with a guy like me

1217
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:28,320
Don't get me wrong

1218
01:26:29,023 --> 01:26:31,265
I didn't cheat on you.

1219
01:26:34,078 --> 01:26:38,249
I have a weakness for women's tears.

1220
01:26:39,632 --> 01:26:40,414
Don't worry.

1221
01:26:41,523 --> 01:26:44,999
I was glad you said you would take me and run.

1222
01:26:47,807 --> 01:26:51,370
I'm happy with that.

1223
01:26:55,693 --> 01:26:56,685
Yukari

1224
01:27:25,642 --> 01:27:26,352
kamoi!

1225
01:27:27,884 --> 01:27:28,931
Oh you

1226
01:27:29,462 --> 01:27:31,282
Did you wait for me?

1227
01:27:31,307 --> 01:27:32,095
What happened to the pistol and the woman?

1228
01:27:32,977 --> 01:27:35,306
They are in the hotel room

1229
01:27:35,774 --> 01:27:37,993
I lost a woman and a pistol again because of you

1230
01:27:38,102 --> 01:27:38,868
That's for you

1231
01:27:39,071 --> 01:27:40,000
What the hell

1232
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:46,602
Can you take care of her sometime?

1233
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:50,243
I have another favor of you

1234
01:27:50,571 --> 01:27:53,837
You know Machiko, Kokichi wife, right?

1235
01:27:54,631 --> 01:27:57,600
She is..

1236
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:01,983
Give this to her, and say good luck

1237
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:03,446
I'm counting on you

1238
01:28:03,471 --> 01:28:04,126
kamoi!

1239
01:28:05,532 --> 01:28:06,876
Ok I get it

1240
01:28:07,477 --> 01:28:07,899
Thanks

1241
01:28:08,134 --> 01:28:09,024
And

1242
01:28:09,852 --> 01:28:12,290
Did you really leave the pistol and woman?

1243
01:28:12,315 --> 01:28:15,907
You insist.
The woman is sleeping and the gun is..

1244
01:28:15,932 --> 01:28:17,555
You have it!

1245
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:20,040
I am popular with women

1246
01:28:20,173 --> 01:28:22,032
But I'm not popular with pistols

1247
01:28:22,126 --> 01:28:22,587
Kamoi

1248
01:28:22,634 --> 01:28:25,907
I know I have illegal possession, but I can't live without this

1249
01:28:26,165 --> 01:28:28,493
Please keep it secret as it will not be used for bad things

1250
01:28:28,688 --> 01:28:31,962
You wrote a good article, so your monthly salary will go up.

1251
01:28:32,235 --> 01:28:33,641
See you then

1252
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:35,071
Wait

1253
01:28:38,762 --> 01:28:39,879
Kamoi!

1254
01:28:51,804 --> 01:29:02,007
THE END

00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:26,980
<i>Namari no Bohyo / Lead Tombstone (1964)</i>

3
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,983
Help me.

4
00:01:41,975 --> 00:01:45,068
No, forgive me!

5
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:49,390
No!!!

6
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,606
Forgive me....

7
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:08,847
Forgive me!

8
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,943
No!!!

9
00:02:27,504 --> 00:02:29,460
Forgive me....

10
00:02:30,558 --> 00:02:31,865
Forgive me....

11
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:08,709
Hold on.

12
00:03:15,552 --> 00:03:16,493
Hold on.

13
00:03:17,545 --> 00:03:18,732
Hold on. I'll shoot you.

14
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:17,949
Come out!

15
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:23,807
Or are you crawling around like that all night trying to turn back?

16
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:24,920
Who are you!

17
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,991
Let's have a proper greeting.

18
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,176
You just went and stuffed yourself under someone else's car without even asking

19
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,458
You're speaking properly for a change.

20
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:35,425
Come out,

21
00:04:36,585 --> 00:04:37,485
I'll run you over.

22
00:05:02,724 --> 00:05:03,410
Hurry up

23
00:05:05,517 --> 00:05:06,410
what are we going to do?

24
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:09,071
It can't possibly get worse than it is now

25
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,506
Am I coming in here?

26
00:05:12,686 --> 00:05:14,338
It’s probably better than coffin, right?

27
00:05:21,413 --> 00:05:24,413
You need to stay still until I open it.

28
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,538
Even if I want to move, I can't.

29
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,791
You have guts.

30
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,686
Hey, where the hell is here?

31
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:34,987
If you follow me, you'll understand.

32
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:38,956
Who?

33
00:07:39,202 --> 00:07:39,855
It's me.

34
00:07:45,836 --> 00:07:46,409
Come in.

35
00:07:46,989 --> 00:07:48,303
You're late

36
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:55,746
This is a synthetic room.

37
00:07:56,332 --> 00:07:58,432
Bring me alcohol and bandages

38
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,800
What the hell is going on? You brought a man I've never seen before.

39
00:08:02,842 --> 00:08:04,255
Just hurry up and bring it.

40
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,608
This guy is injured.

41
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:06,601
I get it,

42
00:08:06,936 --> 00:08:09,856
You'll just buy an ambulance or It would be nice if you opened a hospital,

43
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:14,548
Take off your shirt

44
00:08:22,818 --> 00:08:24,245
What exactly is your business?

45
00:08:25,127 --> 00:08:26,507
Don't speak unnecessarily.

46
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:29,214
Someone shot you.

47
00:08:29,835 --> 00:08:30,489
Damn it.

48
00:08:32,563 --> 00:08:34,981
Lucky guy.
There's no bullet in.

49
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:36,238
It was only a graze.

50
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:51,536
Hurry up,what are you doing?

51
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,808
Ok done.

52
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,180
Bandage him up.

53
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,992
How old are you?

54
00:09:30,325 --> 00:09:31,151
I'm 23.

55
00:09:31,735 --> 00:09:36,625
You have been chased by the police.
You're not going to have a good life.

56
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:40,426
You should probably let your husband hear that line too

57
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,833
You are well-spoken.

58
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,710
Come on, drink up.
 it'll help you forget the pain.

59
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,207
Let me ask you something, do you have a criminal record?

60
00:10:09,549 --> 00:10:11,352
I wouldn't make a mistake that would get I caught.

61
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,539
Drugs?

62
00:10:13,172 --> 00:10:14,712
That's something only trash does.

63
00:10:15,209 --> 00:10:16,937
I can sell it to others, but I won't do it myself.

64
00:10:16,962 --> 00:10:18,642
Alright, then...

65
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,049
just cut it out.

66
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,487
You're not police.

67
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,710
I don't remember asking you for help me at all

68
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:29,416
You brought me here on your own, didn't you?

69
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,076
You're a strong-willed one, I see

70
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,150
I won't ask anything more.

71
00:10:38,651 --> 00:10:41,038
Just make sure to sleep well at home tonight.

72
00:10:41,739 --> 00:10:46,172
You probably can't sleep with that injury, so just try to stay calm

73
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:47,319
Got it?

74
00:10:49,897 --> 00:10:51,023
You're an interesting kid

75
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:56,706
After all, I take care of your wounds and bandage you up

76
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,965
Is it okay if I at least get to know your name?

77
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,461
Or can I call you 'boy'?

78
00:11:10,584 --> 00:11:11,491
I'm Mitsugu.

79
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,571
That's such a cute name.

80
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:17,297
but just so you know,
I won't be indebted to you

81
00:11:20,867 --> 00:11:22,740
You've got some guts

82
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,987
I like you.

83
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,525
Hey, bring a blanket here

84
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:55,933
Good night.

85
00:12:21,338 --> 00:12:23,582
Hey, where did you pick up that kid?

86
00:12:24,516 --> 00:12:25,624
That kid is a strange one

87
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,203
He came crawling under my car like a stray dog.

88
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:31,896
Isn't that dangerous?

89
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,739
Carrying someone like that.

90
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,758
Still you do not get pregnant?

91
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,482
If I was to have a child, I feel sorry for the baby.

92
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,330
That's what I've been saying

93
00:12:49,914 --> 00:12:52,129
I'll quit this business once we have kids

94
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,958
Is it really that easy?

95
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,190
The main boss won't allow it

96
00:13:02,142 --> 00:13:04,239
What the hell are you doing?

97
00:13:32,991 --> 00:13:34,784
Damn it.

98
00:13:42,885 --> 00:13:44,932
What are they doing?

99
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:52,856
Did you sleep well?

100
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,841
I'd been listening to plenty of lullabies

101
00:13:58,505 --> 00:13:59,869
Don't act like an adult.

102
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,799
Are you going out?

103
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,069
You shouldn't overdo it until your injury heals

104
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:19,328
Please let the boy eat something good.

105
00:14:20,302 --> 00:14:20,975
Just wait a moment.

106
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,173
Take me with you too

107
00:14:25,843 --> 00:14:27,590
I'm not going out to play, you know

108
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,667
Well, I'll take you to a nice place eventually, so just behave yourself

109
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,970
I'm asking you to introduce me to your boss

110
00:14:35,929 --> 00:14:36,734
my boss?

111
00:14:37,621 --> 00:14:38,214
Yes.

112
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:42,545
what about your relatives?

113
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,856
My father was taken by the army

114
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:47,174
before I could even remember his face,he die.

115
00:14:48,949 --> 00:14:51,949
and my mother was choked by an American

116
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,915
Even if I owe something to the people out there, I don't have any debts

117
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:56,982
If you tell me to do something, I'll do anything

118
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,891
When I look at you, I feel like
I have no idea what you're going to do next

119
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,538
I've picked up quite a troublemaker.

120
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:08,159
Can you take me with you?

121
00:15:09,136 --> 00:15:11,135
Ah, just wait a bit longer.

122
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:13,792
Wait.

123
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,772
Don't say anything.

124
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,277
Do you even know what kind of man the boss is?

125
00:15:21,402 --> 00:15:23,593
I'll come to meet him if I know.

126
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,394
Once you meet him, you won't want to see him again

127
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,254
You act like a tough guy,

128
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,253
but compared to the boss, you're still just a kid

129
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:41,591
Don't get it twisted; it means you still have some humanity left

130
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,960
Do you have a lover?

131
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,006
Women are just a pain in the ass.

132
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:57,280
See, you immediately turn that way; it's proof that you are still kid.

133
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,376
I'm not saying anything bad,

134
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,498
so just go home as you are

135
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:02,744
What the hell are you?

136
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:06,120
Try if I'm still kid.

137
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:11,313
I'm not easy.

138
00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:43,532
Damn it.

139
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,547
You are just a woman.

140
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:05,121
You're whore!

141
00:19:37,894 --> 00:19:39,723
Please take that ball.

142
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:44,360
Here you go.

143
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,066
Thank you!

144
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:50,394
Good morning

145
00:20:51,832 --> 00:20:53,035
Hello?

146
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:55,527
When did you come?

147
00:20:58,151 --> 00:20:59,316
Uncle is doing well?

148
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,238
Yes.

149
00:21:00,863 --> 00:21:02,679
Cycling races don't make any money.

150
00:21:02,704 --> 00:21:03,480
Tell him.

151
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:04,370
I told him.

152
00:21:04,866 --> 00:21:05,714
He wouldn't have heard it right?

153
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:09,096
He said he was quitting today so please lend me some money.

154
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,176
Did you owe him?

155
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:12,418
so there's no helping it.

156
00:21:12,964 --> 00:21:13,613
How much is it?

157
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:16,926
He will return it with some interest, right?

158
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,277
But that's not good.

159
00:21:18,715 --> 00:21:20,308
Can you let me eat something instead?

160
00:21:22,035 --> 00:21:24,137
So are you eating apples?

161
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:26,206
It's better than drinking water.

162
00:21:30,137 --> 00:21:31,137
You get hurt?

163
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:32,191
It's nothing.

164
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,902
You did something wrong?

165
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:34,824
No way.

166
00:21:35,142 --> 00:21:36,120
Fighting?

167
00:21:36,855 --> 00:21:38,621
It's none of your business.

168
00:21:58,215 --> 00:21:59,355
It tastes good.

169
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:01,260
Eat a lot.

170
00:22:01,469 --> 00:22:02,722
But that's not good.

171
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:03,824
why?

172
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,426
Because You wanted me to cook from

173
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,628
now you treat me

174
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,100
It's the opposite.

175
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,214
I'm not asking for a meal
because I don't have money

176
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:12,854
so why did you come?

177
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:15,265
It's fine, isn't it?

178
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:19,319
it's not fine,that's the important part for me

179
00:22:20,104 --> 00:22:21,190
Why is that?

180
00:22:22,399 --> 00:22:23,308
Insensitive.

181
00:22:23,832 --> 00:22:25,012
insensitive?

182
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:32,348
Kumi.

183
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,644
is something wrong?

184
00:23:02,379 --> 00:23:03,160
See you then.

185
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,238
Where are you going?

186
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:36,348
Big brother

187
00:23:37,449 --> 00:23:38,457
Oh you.

188
00:23:39,997 --> 00:23:42,997
I told you to behave yourself, didn't I?
I won't care if your arm rots

189
00:23:43,406 --> 00:23:44,089
Go home.

190
00:23:44,793 --> 00:23:45,590
Big brother.

191
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,566
I told you to go home

192
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:54,574
but I didn't follow you for any reason

193
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,472
Weren't you just walking in front of me on your own?

194
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:04,105
You said to let you meet the boss, right?

195
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:05,668
Yes.

196
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:08,910
I'll let you meet him, so go home.

197
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:11,254
Really?

198
00:24:11,785 --> 00:24:12,988
You're a smart boy, aren't you?

199
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,074
Where did Shimura go?

200
00:25:07,262 --> 00:25:08,144
Can't you hear me?

201
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:12,144
He went on shopping.

202
00:25:12,355 --> 00:25:13,191
shopping?

203
00:25:16,909 --> 00:25:19,527
Are you getting ready for a high-flying adventure?

204
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:29,488
Where's money?

205
00:25:31,195 --> 00:25:31,808
You are lying

206
00:25:31,926 --> 00:25:34,934
It's true, I'm just going to wait until that person comes back

207
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,098
I'll stay here until he comes back.

208
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,206
There's no need to wait

209
00:25:41,621 --> 00:25:42,519
Don't move.

210
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:46,746
sometimes a man should try going to the kitchen

211
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,870
Well, how about you drink the coffee I made?

212
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,566
It's a 3 million yen coffee

213
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,896
Isn't that a lavish amount?

214
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,308
Do you really think you can steal the
boss's money and get away with it?

215
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:01,869
That's some bad talk about

216
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,541
The money was originally earned by my own hands

217
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:12,250
I just got tired of having it taken away from me so easily

218
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:15,816
Hey you!

219
00:26:27,472 --> 00:26:28,632
Hey, don't go that far.

220
00:26:32,788 --> 00:26:34,683
that's enough already!

221
00:26:51,292 --> 00:26:51,956
On no.

222
00:26:54,088 --> 00:26:57,535
There's no way that could happen.
If I don't do it, you'll be the one getting hurt.

223
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,988
You, you, you!

224
00:27:10,917 --> 00:27:13,597
You idiot, there was no need to kill

225
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,416
You're loud

226
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,644
It's daytime.

227
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:20,410
, and this guy has hidden the boss's money somewhere

228
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,761
I should have heard it from him.

229
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:26,146
I just thought there was no need to hold back against a guy who swings his weapon around like that

230
00:27:33,363 --> 00:27:36,043
You are a murderer

231
00:27:40,214 --> 00:27:42,550
As long as the money comes through, that's all that matters, right?

232
00:27:42,637 --> 00:27:43,582
She does not know

233
00:27:44,347 --> 00:27:45,675
I'll ask  anyway

234
00:27:48,696 --> 00:27:50,831
Hey, what are you planning to do?

235
00:27:51,988 --> 00:27:53,058
Come in.

236
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,449
Where did the money go?

237
00:28:09,676 --> 00:28:10,941
You beast!

238
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,738
Do you think you're human?

239
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:19,535
Where is it? Where is it?

240
00:28:20,387 --> 00:28:21,117
Where is it?

241
00:28:21,421 --> 00:28:22,664
You bastard!

242
00:28:24,527 --> 00:28:25,348
Damn it!

243
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:37,290
I'll tell you.

244
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,144
Where is it?

245
00:28:40,228 --> 00:28:44,058
Can you share it with me?

246
00:28:44,339 --> 00:28:45,917
Where is it?

247
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:48,675
It's in the pillow.

248
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:04,097
1 million is fine, right?

249
00:29:04,394 --> 00:29:05,745
Please.

250
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,761
You'll forget your husband's grudge for 1 million?

251
00:29:10,737 --> 00:29:12,785
He didn't buy me anything

252
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,863
He is dead so he is of no use

253
00:29:17,892 --> 00:29:21,136
Please share the 500,000 yen with me.

254
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,074
Please.

255
00:29:23,784 --> 00:29:26,167
You have a good attitude.

256
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,878
If you're feeling that way,

257
00:29:28,903 --> 00:29:30,347
then I'm not going to hold back either

258
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:34,600
It's better not to say that! Come here!

259
00:31:26,314 --> 00:31:27,088
He is.

260
00:31:28,129 --> 00:31:30,339
This guy.

261
00:31:30,965 --> 00:31:32,777
He's so terrible.

262
00:31:33,637 --> 00:31:35,878
He doesn't think anything of killing someone

263
00:31:37,082 --> 00:31:37,988
How did you clean up afterwards?

264
00:31:38,191 --> 00:31:39,362
It's okay

265
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,986
No one has seen it.

266
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,886
The police are also unaware of his connection.

267
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,676
What have you been doing until now?

268
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:52,120
It's basically the same thing you all have been doing.

269
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:53,871
What?

270
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:58,644
I mean, I've done it all by myself up until now

271
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:01,769
Be careful with the words that say

272
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,589
Well, that's fine

273
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,863
This guy is useful.

274
00:32:08,686 --> 00:32:09,745
Well then

275
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:12,441
Be careful.

276
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:17,058
Before long, you might end up being bossed around by this guy

277
00:32:17,574 --> 00:32:18,496
I see.

278
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:23,027
If this keeps up, I might even lose my head

279
00:32:25,393 --> 00:32:27,855
that's joke, boss

280
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:32,667
I'm not kidding.
That's why a man like that can be useful.

281
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,511
Before you start working, first make the
clothes, got it?

282
00:32:43,043 --> 00:32:44,473
Don't make cheap clothes

283
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:48,378
In this world, a miserly man won't be taken seriously

284
00:32:57,972 --> 00:32:59,339
You are a lucky man

285
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,949
I have no luck

286
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,277
If there is any, it's just something I create myself.

287
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,668
You are as usual

288
00:33:20,168 --> 00:33:21,996
it's a bit too flashy

289
00:33:22,406 --> 00:33:24,792
I haven't seen anything like that, but if that's the case,

290
00:33:24,817 --> 00:33:26,313
how about this?

291
00:33:29,911 --> 00:33:31,980
which one is better?

292
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:33,347
I'll buy both.

293
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:34,777
That's quite extravagant

294
00:33:34,894 --> 00:33:35,343
How much?

295
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,636
Thank you very much

296
00:33:37,754 --> 00:33:38,652
Is it okay with just one.

297
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,519
I see.

298
00:33:39,762 --> 00:33:40,980
I'm the one asking here

299
00:33:41,124 --> 00:33:42,363
Yes, please wait a moment

300
00:33:44,245 --> 00:33:45,516
This is troubling for me

301
00:33:45,986 --> 00:33:48,660
I can't have my wife saying such stingy things

302
00:33:48,869 --> 00:33:49,350
Wife?

303
00:33:49,617 --> 00:33:50,316
Starting tonight

304
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:52,175
Tonight?

305
00:33:52,429 --> 00:33:54,245
Yeah, let's do it grandly,

306
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:55,465
just the two of us

307
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:57,066
Are you serious?

308
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,012
You don't like it?

309
00:33:58,534 --> 00:34:01,113
I can't believe it.

310
00:34:01,495 --> 00:34:03,675
I'll tell your uncle later that it's fine, right?

311
00:36:06,594 --> 00:36:07,628
It's not a dream, is it?

312
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,992
It may not be enough for our main event, but bear with it

313
00:36:14,372 --> 00:36:17,703
I'll rent out the Imperial Hotel for our wedding anniversary next year.

314
00:36:18,907 --> 00:36:22,500
Hmm, it feels like a waste even this way

315
00:36:23,344 --> 00:36:25,109
Don't say stingy things.

316
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:28,390
Don't say lines like that until I've become a bigger deal

317
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:31,690
What does that mean?

318
00:36:33,118 --> 00:36:34,868
What are you thinking?

319
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:39,549
And what happened to the money you spent today?

320
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:42,890
I told you not to ask unnecessary questions, right?

321
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:43,875
But.

322
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:53,500
You're angry, aren't you?

323
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,020
I'm sorry, I won't ask anything anymore

324
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:14,617
Kumi

325
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:17,672
I understand

326
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,531
Come on, don't make such a dull face.

327
00:39:11,945 --> 00:39:12,695
What do you want?

328
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,726
It's you, Mr. Kariya?

329
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,310
That's right, what time do you think it is?

330
00:39:17,508 --> 00:39:18,250
Sorry,

331
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,386
this is an outside line

332
00:39:19,411 --> 00:39:20,187
I'll connect you

333
00:39:20,633 --> 00:39:21,453
Hurry up.

334
00:39:22,547 --> 00:39:23,914
Do you understand it's me?

335
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,510
Ah, what the hell is going on?

336
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:29,836
I feel sorry for you

337
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,258
Your first night should be next time.

338
00:39:31,399 --> 00:39:32,000
What?

339
00:39:32,429 --> 00:39:34,580
Come out to the hotel entrance in about 10 minutes

340
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,164
The car should be waiting

341
00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:39,211
Give me a break.

342
00:39:39,548 --> 00:39:41,758
Hey, it's exactly 10 minutes later

343
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:43,281
Wait a minute.

344
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:44,726
I'm telling you

345
00:39:44,751 --> 00:39:48,617
The president's work doesn't distinguish between day and night

346
00:39:50,571 --> 00:39:51,922
Damn it.

347
00:39:54,555 --> 00:39:55,758
What's wrong?

348
00:39:56,321 --> 00:39:57,914
Who is it from?

349
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:06,969
Are you going out?

350
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:57,641
Where's he?

351
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,453
Thank you for your work.

352
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:23,523
Hurry up, I've got a bride waiting

353
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,516
It's a job suitable for a first day like this

354
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,453
Thank me.

355
00:41:31,383 --> 00:41:32,352
What are you going to do with it.

356
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,867
You know how to use it, right?

357
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,407
Am I planning to kill someone?

358
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,196
What else can you do?

359
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:41,957
But.

360
00:41:41,981 --> 00:41:44,036
there's only one bullet in the pistol.

361
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,031
You can't redo it, got it?

362
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,566
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say;

363
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,506
I won't say it again

364
00:41:51,531 --> 00:41:52,890
First, let's set the clock

365
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,953
It's 3:15.

366
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:57,969
Good.

367
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:01,071
so we should do it at exactly 4:30

368
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,070
Who do we kill?

369
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,750
There is a man who arrives exactly at 4:30 at the entrance of the Nichigeki Cultural Center

370
00:42:09,883 --> 00:42:10,742
What kind of guy is he?

371
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,776
I don't know anything about that

372
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,742
Anyway, just do as you were told, got it?

373
00:42:16,907 --> 00:42:17,797
I get it.

374
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,740
It's exactly 4:30, don't get it wrong, exactly 4:30, okay?

375
00:42:57,281 --> 00:42:59,008
Just 3 more minutes.

376
00:43:36,641 --> 00:43:38,032
Damn it.

377
00:43:38,953 --> 00:43:41,485
I hope the guy will come out at 4:30,

378
00:43:41,510 --> 00:43:42,890
 there's no mistake in the boss's orders

379
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,156
What?

380
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:47,547
There's no mistake in the boss's orders

381
00:43:47,828 --> 00:43:48,953
You seem very great.

382
00:43:49,287 --> 00:43:50,344
It's 4:30, you know

383
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,711
Go.

384
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:41,086
Are you alright?

385
00:47:52,706 --> 00:47:53,828
You were having a nightmare, weren't you?

386
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:56,476
What kind of dream did you have?

387
00:47:57,539 --> 00:48:00,024
Give me some water.

388
00:48:06,828 --> 00:48:08,149
You're tired.

389
00:48:08,868 --> 00:48:10,601
You've probably been having nightmares every night lately

390
00:48:20,459 --> 00:48:21,344
Oh, what time is it?

391
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,715
It's 5 o'clock

392
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,140
Should I make some coffee?

393
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,109
Please.

394
00:49:01,571 --> 00:49:03,274
Why don't you take a break from work for a while?

395
00:49:03,887 --> 00:49:05,664
It would be terrible if you got sick, you know.

396
00:49:08,085 --> 00:49:13,297
You never tell me.
When you do work, what kind of things do you do?

397
00:49:14,237 --> 00:49:16,183
Like you leave early in the morning

398
00:49:16,401 --> 00:49:18,067
Or you  sometimes not coming home all night,

399
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:20,765
I don't really understand it well, but

400
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,680
Sometimes I become extremely anxious

401
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,036
It's none of your business

402
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:31,515
That's not true. I wonder if there are any wives who don't know their husband's job.

403
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:35,164
I'm going to sleep.

404
00:49:52,862 --> 00:49:54,195
Good morning

405
00:50:30,149 --> 00:50:31,493
You look very scary

406
00:50:32,124 --> 00:50:33,383
Knock on the door

407
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:36,994
I forgot about those kinds of formalities

408
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,868
You've really risen in rank since I last saw you

409
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:42,102
Well, you look really worn out.

410
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:46,665
Are you having a kid?

411
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,766
I didn't know that.

412
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:49,946
When?

413
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:51,875
In two months,

414
00:50:52,931 --> 00:50:54,071
huh? I have to celebrate that.

415
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:55,360
What would be good?

416
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:56,456
Just tell me anything

417
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:57,774
No stingy stuff allowed

418
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:00,681
I don't need anything.

419
00:51:00,844 --> 00:51:01,727
That's not good.

420
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:05,368
I want to give something to celebrate your newborn baby.

421
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,579
You shouldn't have any reason to refuse

422
00:51:09,454 --> 00:51:13,508
If you're going to say that much, I have one request. Is that okay?

423
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:15,836
Go on, then

424
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,321
I never want you to come back

425
00:51:23,454 --> 00:51:24,235
Harumi.

426
00:51:26,653 --> 00:51:30,907
I don't want my baby to be like you guys

427
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:37,000
If you want to laugh, go ahead,

428
00:51:38,282 --> 00:51:40,076
but I too have my own story

429
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,969
Even if I think I know well what kind of life I've lived until now,

430
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,758
the child that is born will be different

431
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,640
From now on, he should be able to become any kind of person

432
00:51:55,236 --> 00:51:56,570
I understand.

433
00:51:57,852 --> 00:51:59,805
I promise I won't come back again.

434
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:00,727
 Hey, wait a minute!

435
00:52:01,574 --> 00:52:03,358
Don't get her wrong.

436
00:52:07,523 --> 00:52:10,966
A woman is just a female
before she gives birth,

437
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:15,649
but once she has a child, she changes.

438
00:52:17,690 --> 00:52:19,396
In other words, she becomes a mom

439
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:24,560
I'm weak against those who have changed.

440
00:52:34,801 --> 00:52:37,040
He hasn't changed at all

441
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,297
Who the hell are you?

442
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:56,503
I'm Nomira

443
00:52:56,836 --> 00:52:57,810
What?

444
00:52:58,630 --> 00:52:59,584
What do you want from me...

445
00:52:59,982 --> 00:53:01,536
You.

446
00:53:07,552 --> 00:53:08,683
Boss, who is this guy?

447
00:53:09,194 --> 00:53:11,141
whatever

448
00:53:11,385 --> 00:53:13,379
He's my right-hand man.

449
00:53:13,743 --> 00:53:14,862
His name is Tashiro

450
00:53:15,166 --> 00:53:17,104
Please take care of him.

451
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:19,732
Don't look down on me.

452
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,698
Come on, don't be so angry.
He remind me a lot of the way you used to be

453
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:28,387
By the way, are you going to meet Kaneko?

454
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,343
I met him at his house this morning.

455
00:53:31,595 --> 00:53:32,834
he was still there?

456
00:53:33,475 --> 00:53:34,335
What do you mean?

457
00:53:35,326 --> 00:53:39,714
He came to me last night and said he wanted to quit.

458
00:53:41,263 --> 00:53:41,770
Quit?

459
00:53:43,142 --> 00:53:44,763
I heard he's going to have a child

460
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,536
Eight months?

461
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:47,966
huh? Yeah, that's what it seems

462
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:51,884
I see, that's why

463
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,228
I thought about having you do it

464
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:58,804
but this time the opponent is different

465
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,138
I am thinking of having this man do it.

466
00:54:02,357 --> 00:54:03,177
You mean kill him?

467
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:06,445
You shouldn't be too surprised

468
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:07,615
That's the rule.

469
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,427
What a foolish guy.

470
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,359
Boss, I'll do it.

471
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:17,455
Can you?

472
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:21,049
What will the woman do?

473
00:54:22,251 --> 00:54:23,538
I want to help her

474
00:54:26,383 --> 00:54:28,300
but it seems that's not possible

475
00:54:30,088 --> 00:54:31,160
I understand.

476
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:21,835
You.

477
00:55:26,065 --> 00:55:27,240
I've been waiting

478
00:55:28,938 --> 00:55:29,909
Hey, wait a minute

479
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:33,959
I'm on my way to tell the boss that I give up to quit.

480
00:55:34,486 --> 00:55:35,629
Why didn't you do it sooner?

481
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:39,642
If you had done that, I wouldn't have had to take on such an unpleasant role

482
00:55:44,327 --> 00:55:46,153
She didn't listen to me.

483
00:55:47,488 --> 00:55:49,218
So that's why it took so long?

484
00:55:52,673 --> 00:55:55,673
please just let her go, I'm begging you

485
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,323
Anyway, just get the car out

486
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,008
Where are you going?

487
00:56:44,311 --> 00:56:46,065
Kill me whenever you want.

488
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:51,273
Shut up and There's no need to rush to die.

489
00:57:20,811 --> 00:57:21,978
Run away.

490
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:04,934
Don't go dying.

491
00:59:05,543 --> 00:59:07,859
I was planning to save only you,

492
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:09,050
Don't go dying.

493
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:13,056
That's not like you anymore

494
00:59:13,125 --> 00:59:18,217
But I thought it was unnecessary for you to be so pushy after all

495
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:37,675
That's what I thought.

496
00:59:39,263 --> 00:59:44,624
I thought it would be better to finish the work quickly

497
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,216
Just so you know,

498
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:49,676
I'm refusing to work with you

499
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,121
Even if it's the boss's order.

500
00:59:51,842 --> 00:59:52,762
Never mind.

501
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:55,996
It's best to do work alone, after all

502
00:59:57,570 --> 00:59:59,804
Let's clean up anyway

503
01:00:25,979 --> 01:00:29,332
That's dangerous!
What's wrong?

504
01:00:35,817 --> 01:00:38,817
You're so drunk.

505
01:00:38,871 --> 01:00:40,074
Shut up.

506
01:00:44,535 --> 01:00:47,043
are you hurt somewhere?

507
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,238
You are stupid.

508
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:52,918
I'm fine.
Bring water.

509
01:00:55,714 --> 01:00:59,027
Bring water.

510
01:01:34,276 --> 01:01:34,940
Hey.

511
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:37,807
Kumi.

512
01:01:50,818 --> 01:01:51,822
What are you doing?

513
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:53,939
If call you, at least reply!

514
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:58,885
What happened last night? There was blood on your dress shirt

515
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,814
I must have gotten into a fight while drunk, right?

516
01:02:01,854 --> 01:02:02,526
Wait.

517
01:02:03,930 --> 01:02:06,106
I had known what it was for a long time,

518
01:02:06,131 --> 01:02:06,870
About what?

519
01:02:07,447 --> 01:02:10,185
but just thinking about it was scary

520
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:12,275
I've been deceiving myself all along

521
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,046
What do you mean by that?

522
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,830
It's about what you're doing

523
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,564
Ordinary people can't earn this much even in a year

524
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:23,906
You brought me a large sum of money as if it were pocket change

525
01:02:23,930 --> 01:02:26,036
I'm doing that much work

526
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,369
It's not normal

527
01:02:27,792 --> 01:02:29,213
You're crazy.

528
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,550
The world is crazy.

529
01:02:32,651 --> 01:02:34,026
It could be.

530
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:36,675
What do you want to say?

531
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,049
I don't understand that

532
01:02:39,590 --> 01:02:43,611
Something's off.
it seems like you're overthinking trivial things

533
01:02:45,175 --> 01:02:50,143
Please take me somewhere far away

534
01:02:50,940 --> 01:02:54,604
Please. Anywhere is fine. The farther away, the better.

535
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:55,948
What?

536
01:02:56,532 --> 01:03:00,721
 I have money. I have enough to live without doing anything for two or three years

537
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:03,611
I believe I will eventually find a job.

538
01:03:04,377 --> 01:03:06,909
There are jobs everywhere.

539
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:10,630
That's what I dislike. It's scary

540
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,713
I don't really understand what it is

541
01:03:13,058 --> 01:03:16,058
I can tell that it's not a normal job,

542
01:03:16,233 --> 01:03:21,674
and that's probably a terrifying thing, right?

543
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:35,354
Hey, you know how my mother died, don't you?

544
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:38,385
What did the people of the world do at that time?

545
01:03:38,963 --> 01:03:40,518
What did police do to help?

546
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:44,447
The police said my mother was a prostitute.

547
01:03:46,110 --> 01:03:50,174
Since then, I've been living all alone, by myself

548
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:56,830
Not once has anyone in the world treated me like normal.

549
01:03:58,170 --> 01:04:01,106
I have no obligation to be criticized for whatever I do

550
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:02,126
That's not it

551
01:04:02,150 --> 01:04:03,377
That's not right

552
01:04:03,650 --> 01:04:04,588
What's different?

553
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,447
I may owe something to the people out there, but I don't owe them anything

554
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:10,576
So, does that mean you can do whatever you want to the people out there?

555
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,893
I am who I am

556
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:16,760
I'll show the world what kind of big shot a kid who has lived alone can become.

557
01:05:20,090 --> 01:05:21,677
Did Kaneko say something?

558
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:25,524
The words of the person being targeted are always the same, right?

559
01:05:30,815 --> 01:05:35,438
What's wrong? You look troubled, which isn't like you at all

560
01:05:35,785 --> 01:05:37,999
It's not like this is your first time doing this job

561
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:42,860
Well, for now, just take it easy

562
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:45,201
If anything comes up, I'll contact you again.

563
01:06:11,396 --> 01:06:14,396
For our maid, you have a certain elegance about you.

564
01:06:14,933 --> 01:06:16,638
Do you need something?

565
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,780
or have we met somewhere before?

566
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,197
I'm Kariya's...

567
01:06:25,963 --> 01:06:30,622
What a troublesome man to forget such a cute wife like you.

568
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:33,443
I followed him quietly

569
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:37,290
Do you think that your husband might be cheating?

570
01:06:37,949 --> 01:06:42,065
Please don't let that person do any more bad things

571
01:06:43,509 --> 01:06:44,510
Bad thing?

572
01:06:47,214 --> 01:06:49,274
It seems like you're misunderstanding something.

573
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:51,083
He doesn't anything wrong.

574
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,037
But please don't try to deceive me.

575
01:06:53,830 --> 01:06:55,426
I understand it well

576
01:06:56,310 --> 01:06:58,667
But I won't say anything

577
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:01,222
Please let him go.

578
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,247
Please.

579
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,377
Please return that person to me

580
01:07:08,763 --> 01:07:11,908
That person is not really someone who can do such bad things

581
01:07:13,370 --> 01:07:16,982
Something is definitely wrong, and that's why such things happen

582
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:23,931
It's okay, right? I'll let him quit this job.

583
01:07:24,910 --> 01:07:27,910
Thank you, I apologize for the inconvenience

584
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:52,810
Do you know the woman now?

585
01:07:53,991 --> 01:07:54,511
No.

586
01:07:55,676 --> 01:07:56,724
She's Kariya's wife.

587
01:08:01,045 --> 01:08:02,545
and it's become a hassle

588
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:05,730
What do you think of that woman?

589
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:11,493
If money could buy her, I would buy her for a million dollars.

590
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:14,054
 but she's Kariya's woman

591
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,861
I guess it's good to let Kariya handle it after all

592
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,387
This is awesome.

593
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:34,970
I can't do this anymore.

594
01:08:35,304 --> 01:08:36,977
Hey come on.

595
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:45,634
You look so nice.

596
01:08:53,751 --> 01:08:54,471
Boy.

597
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:00,940
You.

598
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:02,925
I came to pick you up.

599
01:09:03,249 --> 01:09:04,448
Pick me up?

600
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:06,826
Our president wants to see you right away

601
01:09:06,901 --> 01:09:07,781
Our president?

602
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:12,190
Drink this.

603
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:14,941
This is good for sobering up.

604
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:19,895
Do you think I drink this?

605
01:09:20,675 --> 01:09:24,301
Our president hate drunker.

606
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,502
What happened to Tashiro?

607
01:10:14,663 --> 01:10:15,463
I have no idea.

608
01:10:16,627 --> 01:10:18,087
You're as usual.

609
01:10:20,041 --> 01:10:22,023
How about you stop competing with each other?

610
01:10:23,597 --> 01:10:26,597
Both of us have a personality that prefers being alone

611
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:28,179
Take it.

612
01:10:31,698 --> 01:10:32,868
I met for your wife first time,

613
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:35,013
and she's quite a lovely wife,

614
01:10:35,555 --> 01:10:36,202
Did you meet her?

615
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:38,391
She came today

616
01:10:39,537 --> 01:10:40,558
Kumi?

617
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:43,175
You've got quite an eye, haven't you?

618
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,589
So, did my wife say something?

619
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:51,360
She mentioned wanting to cut you off from this world

620
01:10:53,429 --> 01:10:54,329
She...

621
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:56,975
It seems that she followed you today

622
01:10:58,296 --> 01:11:01,296
Our conversation was completely overheard

623
01:11:02,779 --> 01:11:05,463
She's a woman unmoved by money.

624
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:11,214
You took a troublesome woman as your wife.

625
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:15,496
I'll do something.

626
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:18,660
there's only one way to deal with it

627
01:11:22,109 --> 01:11:24,489
I wonder if you can.

628
01:11:24,663 --> 01:11:25,263
Boss.

629
01:11:27,806 --> 01:11:29,428
I can't believe it.

630
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,507
I feel sorry but

631
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:36,060
Close her eyes

632
01:11:38,420 --> 01:11:40,298
It's for your sake

633
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:50,670
Let's just say the deadline will last until tomorrow.

634
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:56,598
Once it's over, take some time off and go on a trip.

635
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,550
Thank you for your hard work.

636
01:12:46,956 --> 01:12:48,189
Oh we are closed.

637
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:49,522
Don't worry.

638
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:50,943
Please.

639
01:12:55,302 --> 01:12:56,342
what can I offer you?

640
01:12:57,470 --> 01:12:58,294
Whiskey.

641
01:12:58,581 --> 01:12:59,508
I understood.

642
01:14:29,843 --> 01:14:32,843
I sincerely apologize.

643
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:06,441
Who are you?

644
01:15:08,303 --> 01:15:08,943
Excuse me.

645
01:15:34,648 --> 01:15:36,185
Stop it....

646
01:16:11,922 --> 01:16:12,555
No...

647
01:16:14,405 --> 01:16:15,118
No...

648
01:16:24,578 --> 01:16:25,351
No...

649
01:16:31,145 --> 01:16:32,651
Stay down.

650
01:16:34,575 --> 01:16:35,781
Stop it....

651
01:16:46,380 --> 01:16:47,460
No..

652
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,913
Stop it....

653
01:17:07,938 --> 01:17:08,771
No..

654
01:17:24,709 --> 01:17:25,695
No..

655
01:17:31,373 --> 01:17:32,287
No..

656
01:17:45,316 --> 01:17:46,311
No... no... ah...

657
01:19:13,114 --> 01:19:14,358
Customer.

658
01:19:14,383 --> 01:19:15,769
It has already gone past 1 am.

659
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:40,937
Ah 608.

660
01:19:46,236 --> 01:19:48,533
Kumi?, it's me.

661
01:19:49,870 --> 01:19:51,317
You told me you'd like to go somewhere far.

662
01:19:52,856 --> 01:19:55,856
Get ready and wait in front of the apartment.

663
01:19:56,755 --> 01:19:58,348
Did you make up your mind?

664
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:01,219
You're going to quit your current job, right?

665
01:20:01,373 --> 01:20:01,900
I will.

666
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:06,246
Is there anyone who cries?

667
01:20:06,643 --> 01:20:07,486
Hurry up.

668
01:21:40,628 --> 01:21:42,214
You.

669
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:03,367
Kumi...

670
01:22:11,186 --> 01:22:11,879
Kumi.

671
01:22:14,893 --> 01:22:15,413
Kumi.

672
01:22:16,813 --> 01:22:17,413
Kumi.

673
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:20,705
Kumi.

674
01:22:27,225 --> 01:22:27,765
Why?

675
01:22:29,876 --> 01:22:30,930
why is this happening?

676
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,307
I was so close to becoming a mom, you know?

677
01:22:46,730 --> 01:22:47,344
Become a mom?

678
01:23:00,977 --> 01:23:02,137
You haven't noticed it?

679
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:10,525
I can't believe it.

680
01:23:17,866 --> 01:23:21,911
It's too late...

681
01:23:40,780 --> 01:23:41,287
Kumi?

682
01:23:42,647 --> 01:23:43,307
Kumi?

683
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:46,981
Kumi....

684
01:25:22,502 --> 01:25:27,448
THE END

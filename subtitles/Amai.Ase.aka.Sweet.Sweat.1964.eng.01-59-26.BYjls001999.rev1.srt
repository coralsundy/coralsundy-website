<i>Amai Ase / Sweet Sweat (1964)</i>

3
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,361
What's the hell!

4
00:02:12,603 --> 00:02:13,322
Hi.

5
00:02:13,529 --> 00:02:15,013
Yeah, good morning

6
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:54,439
Oh just lovers.

7
00:03:10,884 --> 00:03:12,181
Don't do anything strange.

8
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:31,290
Stop it.

9
00:03:54,564 --> 00:03:55,838
Stop it.

10
00:03:56,669 --> 00:04:01,446
If you break this product, you won't just have to pay for it

11
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:04,579
You're young, so you shouldn't be so violent.

12
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,236
You don't have to deal with him.

13
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,017
I mean, even though Okabe-san has transferred to us, it's still a deal.

14
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:23,048
I am so frustrated.

15
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:24,435
It's okay, it's okay,

16
00:04:25,092 --> 00:04:28,821
I don't care how many lovers you have.

17
00:04:29,283 --> 00:04:30,064
Right?

18
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:33,985
I hate it.

19
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:49,095
What's wrong with taking the money you make now and saving it up ?

20
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,126
If you're upset, you can earn it back with your skills

21
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:55,931
Since we are both in business, it is no one's fault whether we win or lose

22
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,470
Don't you think so?

23
00:04:58,734 --> 00:05:04,595
Now that you're 36, you're losing to younger women.

24
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,566
Even Okabe-san

25
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,590
He hates old women.

26
00:05:11,232 --> 00:05:18,665
I have a better body than younger women.

27
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,767
You're just loser.

28
00:05:26,545 --> 00:05:30,314
Hey. what's wrong?

29
00:05:32,614 --> 00:05:38,454
Even though I'm an old woman, I'm very good inside.

30
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,235
I'm frustrated.

31
00:05:43,088 --> 00:05:44,634
There was a big insect.

32
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:58,454
Emotions aren't necessary in business.

33
00:05:59,835 --> 00:06:02,835
You talk too much good stuff

34
00:06:03,474 --> 00:06:05,532
They say he is good with money and kind

35
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,410
Even among friends, the young people of today are different

36
00:06:10,534 --> 00:06:17,071
Okabe-san is still a section manager, so he doesn't have that much money.

37
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,478
I think he has dirty money.

38
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:26,368
I've been hesitant to tell you that for a long time.

39
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,571
Now is the time for you to quit

40
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:32,820
I've been working hard for half a year now

41
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,236
You have to work with her.

42
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:37,962
You are the only one who is careful about Kanna.

43
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,860
I know a good husband, so I'll give him to you

44
00:06:48,673 --> 00:06:49,564
Really?

45
00:06:50,547 --> 00:06:53,478
Yes, I ran into him on the street the other day

46
00:06:53,562 --> 00:06:54,435
What kind of person is he?

47
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:56,907
He is very high-ranking.

48
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,642
Really?

49
00:06:59,183 --> 00:07:03,870
That's true,Please stop drinking too much and try again.

50
00:07:04,462 --> 00:07:06,001
It's none of your business

51
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,681
Are there any men like that?

52
00:07:08,647 --> 00:07:10,595
You will be the fourth mistress.

53
00:07:11,088 --> 00:07:15,322
I don't care what number it is.

54
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:22,505
He was regular customer of us when I was in Shinbashi.

55
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,461
He looked so rich

56
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:33,451
But you look poor.

57
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,946
You're too good.

58
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,339
No, I called him then.

59
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,240
Your friend has come.

60
00:07:59,594 --> 00:08:02,594
Please don't hesitate to come here.

61
00:08:09,044 --> 00:08:10,253
Can you drink?

62
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:11,732
I can't.

63
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:21,000
That's a lot.

64
00:08:21,574 --> 00:08:22,974
Thanks.

65
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,510
I heard from the bartender,Fujii-kun

66
00:08:30,225 --> 00:08:34,782
Fujii-kun said you live in a public housing complex and has a large family

67
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
I live in relatives

68
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,680
You don't have any parents or siblings?

69
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:42,893
No.

70
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,685
My parents died and I was living in different homes from a young age

71
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,060
Now I live with my aunt's family

72
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:52,856
You're always lonely.

73
00:08:54,923 --> 00:08:56,262
I'll serve you.

74
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:04,649
Don't worry.

75
00:09:04,902 --> 00:09:05,938
Sorry.

76
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,539
I'm sorry.

77
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:13,413
You live in small house?

78
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,832
Yes 8 members.

79
00:09:15,857 --> 00:09:17,471
That's hard.

80
00:09:17,496 --> 00:09:18,899
I can't imagine.

81
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:21,427
How hard it must be.

82
00:09:24,351 --> 00:09:25,903
How are they?

83
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:30,018
Their family are all working hard.

84
00:09:30,859 --> 00:09:32,590
They are nice.

85
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,257
I mean....

86
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:43,607
The bath is always ready.

87
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,047
What kind of work did your father do?

88
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,490
He was carpenter.

89
00:09:49,878 --> 00:09:50,448
carpenter?

90
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,465
He was more like architecture.

91
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,402
He dies in accident.

92
00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:57,789
Then your mother died?

93
00:10:00,742 --> 00:10:01,705
I see.

94
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:04,637
That's enough.

95
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,473
that makes the alcohol taste bad

96
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:17,198
To be honest, I am putting family first

97
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,100
No matter what happens, creating a family is

98
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,600
I think it's a sin for my sons

99
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:30,496
Even if I have a second or third mistress, I have never told them.

100
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,300
My wife hasn't noticed anything until now

101
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,126
Well, that's the system I used to take care of No. 2 and No. 3 mistress.

102
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,080
Is that bad?

103
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:50,337
As long as my girl doesn't cheat on me,I will
never give up giving their living expenses or anything else

104
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:53,127
I'm like that.

105
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:54,759
You're so great.

106
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,009
it is no good to abandon a woman

107
00:10:58,485 --> 00:11:00,265
I must not make a woman cry

108
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,613
That's my motto

109
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,412
Good.

110
00:11:03,824 --> 00:11:05,473
It's not more but motto.

111
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:08,748
Do you understand?

112
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:10,780
It's not more but motto.

113
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,360
Yes, by "motto" I mean...

114
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:19,708
I can't find the right words to say in Japanese,

115
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:23,773
but it's a sign

116
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,798
Just translate it to the meaning of the words on the sign

117
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:29,702
By the way.

118
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:34,028
Now I don't go to either No. 2 or No. 3 at all

119
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,852
I haven't been there.

120
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:41,303
But I've given them a house for about twenty years now,

121
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:46,019
and I think it's my duty to keep quiet if someone doesn't betray me

122
00:11:47,101 --> 00:11:48,937
I'll try to serve you too.

123
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,305
I absolutely hate telling lies too

124
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,103
I don't like either.

125
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:57,358
Yes, it looks like that to me too. You seem to be the same

126
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,676
Just to be sure

127
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:05,923
Betray me once and it's all over.

128
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,380
It was the first time I'd ever been told something like that by a man.

129
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:11,350
I'd been betrayed by a man

130
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,914
 women are always made to cry

131
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,668
I have a villa in Fujisawa, and if you want to use it, you can

132
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,446
Have you ever had to rely on someone else?

133
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:32,838
No.

134
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,474
Do you see a guy?

135
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,911
I did before.

136
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:41,582
Right? There were quite a few

137
00:12:44,443 --> 00:12:45,370
Come here.

138
00:13:25,332 --> 00:13:26,705
That's scary,.

139
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,082
Sato-chan, Sato-chan

140
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:54,141
Oh, you just got back?

141
00:14:03,462 --> 00:14:04,917
How was it?

142
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,216
Yes, I thought you were coming back last night.

143
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:10,798
But suddenly, I decided to go to Miyanoshita.

144
00:14:10,823 --> 00:14:11,679
Hakone?

145
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,534
That's good.

146
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,876
He bought me this and I was supposed to go home

147
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,328
Suddenly I changed mind.

148
00:14:22,465 --> 00:14:23,240
You gain a lot.

149
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:32,438
Here it is.

150
00:14:35,606 --> 00:14:37,690
Yes, there was a lot of thunder here

151
00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:39,915
But rain doesn't stop.

152
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,030
I'll go take a bath before then

153
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,520
Let me listen more about it later

154
00:14:47,381 --> 00:14:49,771
My tie got wet?

155
00:14:49,859 --> 00:14:52,028
I'm going to wash it all later anyway,

156
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,390
I'll just pay for the washing machine.

157
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,916
You didn't sleep last night?

158
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,152
Hakone was not crowded?

159
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:12,655
there's an open-air bath in Hakone late at night, no one was there.

160
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:21,140
When I soak in hot water, my legs look slim and long

161
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,357
I look like a mermaid.

162
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,219
What are you talking about?

163
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:33,486
I'll get some money from you.

164
00:15:34,784 --> 00:15:35,869
That's enough.

165
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,253
I'll be back soon

166
00:15:56,638 --> 00:15:59,638
I came back and had to return my kimono

167
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,579
He was there?

168
00:16:06,785 --> 00:16:07,890
Apparently.

169
00:16:12,364 --> 00:16:14,546
Thank you very much.

170
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,441
What's the hell?

171
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:19,232
Did you make a deal?

172
00:16:19,789 --> 00:16:22,789
He was like "I'll let you stay at the villa"

173
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,570
That's good.

174
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:29,380
First, let's have a toast to thank you

175
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,254
Yes,I am thirsty?

176
00:16:40,071 --> 00:16:41,681
It's hard to pretend I can't drink.

177
00:16:41,813 --> 00:16:43,710
Congratulations.

178
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:45,993
Thank you for your help.

179
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,907
It tastes good.

180
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:53,859
I am thirsty

181
00:16:54,006 --> 00:16:57,006
I have received my monthly payment.

182
00:16:58,908 --> 00:16:59,896
Never mind.

183
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,297
You...

184
00:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,785
Don't get me wrong.

185
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,113
I'm not doing this for the money, it's just for you, don't get me wrong

186
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,663
He is just old man.

187
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:16,027
I'll thank you

188
00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:17,626
You don't have to.

189
00:17:19,046 --> 00:17:20,633
Let's have some fun tonight, shall we?

190
00:17:24,394 --> 00:17:26,487
Let's have fun.

191
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,611
I'll be your strength.

192
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:36,095
I'll be kept man from now on?

193
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:42,446
I'm feeling lonely.

194
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:48,481
The mood is sad

195
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,050
I don't want you to take my money.

196
00:17:56,863 --> 00:17:59,863
I can always break this story.

197
00:18:08,102 --> 00:18:13,709
If there is a man in power, there will be no women's fights.

198
00:18:14,823 --> 00:18:18,733
Even if you think about a girl's happiness after you turn 40, there's no one to suit you

199
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:25,420
Aren't the two of you the future font?

200
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,888
I'll make a lot of money now

201
00:18:27,913 --> 00:18:30,489
I'll think about it. It's a good idea,

202
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,804
but are you confident that you can do it alone?

203
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,636
If you can just act as a bridge, then okay

204
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:46,928
Then let's have fun  tonight.

205
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:02,282
I guess there's a mood.

206
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:05,966
Yes, about my body getting stiffer

207
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,660
It's hard being a woman in a place like this,

208
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:11,256
So where we can have fun?

209
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,550
They are going to come back..

210
00:19:14,575 --> 00:19:15,570
It's okay.

211
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:22,248
You don't know What kind of feelings does a woman have.

212
00:19:22,674 --> 00:19:24,667
What's the hell?

213
00:19:26,262 --> 00:19:29,262
So, are you waiting in Ogiya?

214
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,423
Are you all too close?

215
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:36,330
Then We'll take a taxi and go somewhere

216
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,190
Then, see you at the taxi stand on campus at 10:30

217
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:45,128
Open the door.

218
00:19:45,254 --> 00:19:46,834
See you then.

219
00:19:51,168 --> 00:19:53,303
Oh my god.

220
00:20:08,812 --> 00:20:13,025
Soon all of these house here will be removed

221
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,975
We have to move out.

222
00:20:16,709 --> 00:20:19,099
Everyone will move to the shopping center, right?

223
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,620
I was told the food and beverage district is in the basement.

224
00:20:20,768 --> 00:20:23,495
It will be too small.

225
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,996
Have you seen Oume since then?

226
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:28,753
Oume?

227
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,960
I guess She returned the kimono and haven't been here since then?

228
00:20:33,605 --> 00:20:34,718
She didn't come to see me.

229
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,413
She quit.

230
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,968
I see, I see, that's it

231
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,507
Some bar has moved out.

232
00:20:42,017 --> 00:20:43,310
But they can do business in the shipping center.

233
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,766
The royalties are expensive.

234
00:20:48,313 --> 00:20:49,866
You worry about the money?

235
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:52,039
What time?

236
00:20:54,177 --> 00:20:55,731
12:15.

237
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,302
On no.

238
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,881
The rent...

239
00:21:00,361 --> 00:21:01,501
 that's how it is

240
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,759
They say it's going to be ours but I don' know how many year it will take to pay back

241
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:08,246
Are you waiting for someone?

242
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:15,033
wouldn't she be there? She'd be drinking somewhere

243
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:25,983
Damn it.

244
00:21:28,608 --> 00:21:30,415
I was waiting for you.

245
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:38,170
This is the taxi fare. Go get it

246
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,610
Apparently you are not the kind of woman I had in mind

247
00:21:44,743 --> 00:21:47,169
I thought I said that if you lied it would be the end

248
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,236
Who would do that for you?

249
00:21:49,146 --> 00:21:50,509
Anything ok.

250
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,540
I hate women who betray other people's actions the most.

251
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,354
You're pretending to cry.

252
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:05,013
I won't be fool.

253
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:08,034
It's no use anymore, stop it

254
00:22:09,111 --> 00:22:10,427
You're not kid.

255
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:13,822
I am really my aunt's children

256
00:22:13,963 --> 00:22:17,463
Who told you about me?

257
00:22:18,652 --> 00:22:23,010
So you're not lonely,  you have a mother and a family of eight, right?

258
00:22:23,986 --> 00:22:26,986
You're hiding the fact that you have such a large family

259
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,350
It's ok but

260
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,409
If the 17-year-old girl is the aunt's child...

261
00:22:36,593 --> 00:22:39,559
The 65-year-old woman given birth at 48

262
00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:40,777
Right?

263
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,857
She's 70...

264
00:22:43,006 --> 00:22:45,973
She gives a birth at 53?

265
00:22:46,767 --> 00:22:48,409
No. 60.

266
00:22:52,975 --> 00:22:55,645
Is that problem?

267
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,287
You said No?

268
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,525
You told me you were 30.

269
00:23:02,315 --> 00:23:06,186
If you had a 17 year old child, you gave a birth at 13.

270
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:08,342
You are mean.

271
00:23:10,363 --> 00:23:12,672
Don't say that.

272
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:16,090
I'm not happy at all

273
00:23:17,327 --> 00:23:22,337
Depending on how you act, I think there may be
sympathy

274
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:25,603
Go easy on about one of the children.

275
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:29,835
I don't intend to ask you to do it for life with that , how about one year contract?

276
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:33,120
What do you think? I'll do my best to serve you

277
00:23:34,267 --> 00:23:37,267
I'm going home alone

278
00:23:37,491 --> 00:23:38,337
So please bring this.

279
00:23:38,946 --> 00:23:40,354
In return, please don't call me anymore.

280
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,928
That car has arrived

281
00:24:04,485 --> 00:24:06,065
I'll take a bath soon.

282
00:24:16,407 --> 00:24:18,647
so thank you for your help

283
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,589
It hurts.

284
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,678
Umeko-san has returned, What are you doing?

285
00:25:49,283 --> 00:25:51,170
What are you doing?

286
00:25:52,214 --> 00:25:54,027
Get up.

287
00:25:55,997 --> 00:25:59,074
Ah, this is my cloth.
Give it back.

288
00:25:59,438 --> 00:26:02,056
You wore it while I was at school

289
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,080
My red pants have disappeared too

290
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:09,660
I'm upset ? I've ironed it properly

291
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:11,983
Is it okay

292
00:26:21,508 --> 00:26:22,749
Ah, skirt, skirt, skirt, skirt.

293
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:30,507
Umeko-san

294
00:26:31,026 --> 00:26:32,284
I tell you.

295
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,483
Did the teacher only tell me.

296
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:39,830
He said he wouldn't give me the score book because I didn't pay tuition for six months.

297
00:26:40,173 --> 00:26:42,843
Yeah, put yourself in that position

298
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:48,571
And then I have to take the donation money before summer vacation.

299
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:55,562
I haven't even paid for this month's flowers yet,  I'm so pissed.

300
00:26:56,327 --> 00:27:00,065
I told him to tell my parents

301
00:27:01,718 --> 00:27:02,632
I know.

302
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,975
I gave the letter to your mother

303
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,688
My mother blew her nose at the letter.

304
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,837
What the hell is going on?

305
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:14,550
You're awake.

306
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,067
Don't disturb me.

307
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:23,990
If you just look at my face, you say about money.

308
00:27:28,196 --> 00:27:30,290
I really don't understand.

309
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,276
It happened occasionally If I don't say
this, I won't be able to say it properly

310
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:38,022
It's a good time.

311
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,705
Did you study?

312
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:43,471
You act like a mom.

313
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:45,500
I don't seem to be flunking out.

314
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:46,970
Is that true?

315
00:27:47,071 --> 00:27:48,578
It's still 1st semester.

316
00:27:49,208 --> 00:27:50,088
I see.

317
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,302
Be quiet.

318
00:27:55,526 --> 00:27:56,966
Get out.

319
00:28:00,689 --> 00:28:05,269
He tells me to pay for food.

320
00:28:05,326 --> 00:28:06,747
I'm mad.

321
00:28:06,772 --> 00:28:08,091
You're our child.

322
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,875
Well, that's why you don't need to worry?

323
00:28:14,267 --> 00:28:15,140
well..

324
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:16,793
Keep sleeping

325
00:28:17,538 --> 00:28:22,077
I'm really not feeling well.

326
00:28:22,351 --> 00:28:23,705
I won't eat here

327
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,866
Everyone has to work to survive.

328
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:30,096
I hope I'm fine.

329
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,950
but I can't be bothered with you.

330
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,272
I know there is lunch.

331
00:28:38,773 --> 00:28:42,903
Don't say things like that

332
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,942
If you hate me, hate me

333
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,061
Well, that's how it goes

334
00:28:54,238 --> 00:28:55,404
Take.

335
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:02,295
How about monthly tuition fee?

336
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:03,802
Not yet

337
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:07,990
It was rebuilt while I was away

338
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,816
Going to the pool.

339
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
You need bus fare to go skating

340
00:29:14,356 --> 00:29:17,356
Even I, who go to the hospital

341
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,876
have to pay for medical expenses,

342
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:24,269
it's already too much for me

343
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,686
And when you started going to high school,

344
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:32,702
Toke-chan's requests started to get more and more...

345
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:42,221
The cost was more than I expected.

346
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,209
It'll be 5,000 yen for four people: Jiro, his wife, the child, and the baby

347
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:52,620
I'm running out of money for food too

348
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,607
My medical insurance has expired.

349
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:59,850
I just found a plumbing job

350
00:30:01,409 --> 00:30:08,320
That's good that Sanpei goes to work regularly at the printing factory

351
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,206
If you get married, you'll probably leave anyway,

352
00:30:13,428 --> 00:30:17,950
and I won't be able to have any more grandchildren living together

353
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,536
Even if We work together

354
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,560
it won't make me 10,000 yen

355
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:34,028
From laundry and sewing to the kitchen and grocery shopping

356
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,339
It's not easy.

357
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:42,852
You've been taking care of your grandchildren.

358
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,392
You also have an eye condition.

359
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:50,502
If I go blind, I'd rather hang myself

360
00:30:50,775 --> 00:30:53,775
Why you guys are repeating like that?

361
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,472
Shut up!

362
00:30:58,342 --> 00:31:02,112
Oh,Who dropped my wallet and took out?

363
00:31:03,676 --> 00:31:05,163
It smells bad.

364
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,142
I borrowed.I'm going to wash it and return.

365
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,686
I put important things from school in there

366
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:13,710
Isn't it okay to just put something in.

367
00:31:13,741 --> 00:31:17,556
That's ok.
I just borrowed it.

368
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,167
You're causing trouble us.

369
00:31:26,709 --> 00:31:28,482
Don't cry.

370
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:33,339
It's hard to understand.

371
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,290
Don't give up.

372
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,994
Madam.

373
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:44,718
Is it bad to have a daughter in her parents' house?

374
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:45,948
parents' house?

375
00:31:46,452 --> 00:31:49,452
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it

376
00:31:50,586 --> 00:31:53,586
We've been taking care of you guys from Kobe days.

377
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:56,730
We were drifting to Tokyo, where our grandmother was born

378
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,011
Don't be ungrateful.

379
00:31:58,713 --> 00:32:00,949
I'm really her son.

380
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:04,882
After my dad fell off the grass and my brother was killed in the war

381
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:10,796
For the sake of everyone, I've been working as a cashier at a bakery, working in a restaurant and a coffee shop since I was 15 years old,

382
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:14,038
but I still am like this.

383
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:20,370
I worked a night job to raise you guys.

384
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,792
That is compulsory education.

385
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:30,222
I also made money through small business.

386
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,409
When I was young, I would make money but then spend it all right away.

387
00:32:35,808 --> 00:32:37,511
Now we are working

388
00:32:37,848 --> 00:32:40,848
We're in the same boat.

389
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,230
Prices are rising.

390
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:46,705
You don't want to be treated like a big shot just because you paid a little money.

391
00:32:47,412 --> 00:32:49,261
It's better than nothing.

392
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:54,595
You can't even take care of her daughter

393
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:57,430
you don't have to complain about me

394
00:32:57,455 --> 00:32:59,808
I won't.

395
00:33:00,753 --> 00:33:03,550
So I won't let you do anything like a wife

396
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:10,433
We do the same and get up the same way

397
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,846
You're still 65 at this age.

398
00:33:13,215 --> 00:33:14,612
What do you mean?

399
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,985
you're still young?

400
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:22,252
Thank you so much, you caught sick person.

401
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:24,378
Get out.

402
00:33:26,113 --> 00:33:27,363
I'll do it.

403
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,675
It hurts.

404
00:33:31,205 --> 00:33:33,081
What's the hell?

405
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:34,988
It's all my fault

406
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,690
Stop it....

407
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,084
How embarrassed we all are

408
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:46,097
Drinking every day, fighting, sleeping on the road

409
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,776
I hope she'll come back soon.

410
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,800
The other day she was walking around with a different guy

411
00:33:51,425 --> 00:33:53,011
If she comes home

412
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:55,573
She has no work.

413
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,972
So I told her not to have a baby.

414
00:33:59,081 --> 00:34:01,066
Is it really that much of a hassle to have me at home?

415
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:04,768
Who made me this way?

416
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:11,144
You all ate a lot of the apples I bought.

417
00:34:12,062 --> 00:34:16,215
I bought a lot of rice.

418
00:34:17,146 --> 00:34:18,022
stop it.

419
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:21,229
You all depended on me while I was working.

420
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,464
Why do you hate me now?

421
00:34:28,745 --> 00:34:31,065
I'm willing to sell my body

422
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:37,651
I want my son to go to college.

423
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,676
Yeah, I get it, I get it, sleep.

424
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:51,130
And I'll have Take-chan take a look at it

425
00:34:51,566 --> 00:34:52,660
I'm going.

426
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:22,487
Even if I try, I have nowhere to go

427
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:25,136
It can't be helped.

428
00:35:25,492 --> 00:35:27,183
I can't move out.

429
00:35:27,588 --> 00:35:31,237
The customers will gradually be sucked into the basement of the shopping center

430
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:35,132
I can't do business in this store any more.

431
00:35:38,121 --> 00:35:40,437
Let's eat for a second

432
00:35:41,044 --> 00:35:44,044
I skip lunch because I got fat.

433
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:46,688
there's ramen.

434
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:53,770
Give me one bottle.

435
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,726
Is there anywhere good?

436
00:36:01,992 --> 00:36:07,310
I said I'd be happy to thank you if I could bring in some customers

437
00:36:09,715 --> 00:36:11,656
I can earn money to drink

438
00:36:11,891 --> 00:36:14,477
Your customers will pay even if they drink a lot.

439
00:36:14,612 --> 00:36:19,195
If I get him to drink a lot, I'd like to thank you.

440
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:23,734
We have no choice but to do business like that.

441
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,594
But you are going to destroy your body

442
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:31,391
That's fine.

443
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,953
I know some friends who like flowers and mahjong,

444
00:36:36,537 --> 00:36:38,633
so I'll bring them over here.

445
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:43,219
They drink alcohol even if they lose at gambling.

446
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:46,703
It would be a great help to us if she could take some customers with her.

447
00:36:48,342 --> 00:36:50,531
I wish I could do that

448
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:54,344
You can just drink and walk around

449
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:56,961
it's quicker than finding a husband

450
00:36:57,897 --> 00:36:59,312
This is much better.

451
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:02,039
Yeah it's easy.

452
00:37:03,422 --> 00:37:05,312
That job is better for my children's education.

453
00:37:05,337 --> 00:37:07,344
You are retiring from your current job.

454
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:18,056
so I'll try to do it.

455
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,282
I'll ask some

456
00:37:23,271 --> 00:37:26,271
Please bring that guest with you tonight.

457
00:37:28,463 --> 00:37:30,234
Please, that's good

458
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,422
Oh please

459
00:37:44,449 --> 00:37:47,035
There's no excitement in a match.

460
00:37:51,597 --> 00:37:53,305
Yes yes yes

461
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:06,294
Brother, Do you sell fountain pens locally?

462
00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:10,617
I'm thinking about doing business around here.

463
00:38:10,729 --> 00:38:11,905
I'm home.

464
00:38:15,164 --> 00:38:18,164
There are a lot of people here.

465
00:38:18,313 --> 00:38:20,071
but it's okay, Ta-chan

466
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:21,555
Take.

467
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,046
No, I thought that was

468
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,070
You have grown so much

469
00:38:31,107 --> 00:38:32,983
You're already adult.

470
00:38:33,703 --> 00:38:35,149
Thanks

471
00:38:35,188 --> 00:38:38,163
Her mother is sloppy

472
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:40,764
Don't say that

473
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:44,265
I still sleep with her

474
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,290
I guess she feels lonely.

475
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:50,983
Until recently, she was drinking my milk.

476
00:38:51,016 --> 00:38:53,493
Don't say that

477
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,650
What are you doing? Because I'm hungry

478
00:38:59,731 --> 00:39:01,097
Is there nothing there?

479
00:39:01,785 --> 00:39:03,396
There's nothing.

480
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:06,850
I was studying for exams with everyone in the library

481
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,000
You didn't say that.

482
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,416
I told you that if you weren't there when dinner was being prepared,

483
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,966
it would all go to waste

484
00:39:12,997 --> 00:39:15,086
When can we count on you?

485
00:39:23,408 --> 00:39:24,578
I'm going to be leaving early tomorrow.

486
00:39:24,782 --> 00:39:28,149
Prepare bed.

487
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:33,258
You're doing great.

488
00:39:33,283 --> 00:39:34,477
This is my side business.

489
00:39:35,918 --> 00:39:43,914
Monday is white, Tuesday is yellow, and pink is Sunday, and then Saturday comes

490
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,210
Also, what day is this red one?

491
00:39:47,868 --> 00:39:49,461
I wonder what day it was

492
00:39:49,735 --> 00:39:50,368
Take.

493
00:39:50,697 --> 00:39:51,242
What?

494
00:39:51,267 --> 00:39:53,532
When will there be red pants?

495
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,672
I don't know

496
00:39:55,138 --> 00:39:58,124
It's none of my business

497
00:39:58,493 --> 00:39:59,657
It's easy work.

498
00:40:02,349 --> 00:40:06,719
Even if I work hard, I won't make 500 or 600 yen a month, not 1,000 yen

499
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,446
I have kids so

500
00:40:08,471 --> 00:40:11,470
You need to clean up.

501
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,154
Yes, yes, sorry

502
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:15,009
I'll help you.

503
00:40:15,249 --> 00:40:17,405
Oh, sorry

504
00:40:18,105 --> 00:40:20,039
please put it on top of the food

505
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,279
Can I put my bed here?

506
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:29,001
Please, please.

507
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,425
Please move from there.

508
00:40:38,725 --> 00:40:40,733
it's a little small so...

509
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,686
Let's all go to the health center tomorrow.

510
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,100
The construction will be finished soon.

511
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:54,738
That's great, brother. Let's go. Shall we go? Let's go.

512
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:05,953
That's enough. Good night

513
00:41:10,586 --> 00:41:13,880
I think you should go to your friend's place

514
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,352
It's too late.

515
00:41:15,998 --> 00:41:17,273
you'll have to turn the lights on every night

516
00:41:17,305 --> 00:41:18,555
Everyone can't sleep

517
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,000
even the auntie over there, she wake up early

518
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:23,203
Tamako's too

519
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:26,810
I'll turn it off.

520
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:44,060
I would be happy to take in Take-chan,

521
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,700
but with his mother there, it's no use

522
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:50,254
That's what people say

523
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,395
I wish you had no parents.

524
00:41:53,481 --> 00:41:55,051
Yeah.

525
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:02,262
Please don't bring drunk people into this house.

526
00:42:03,246 --> 00:42:06,379
you don't know the hardships of children

527
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:10,426
I made some rice balls and they're delicious

528
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,215
Ah, I wonder if I should eat some too. Thank you

529
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,230
Then let's do that.

530
00:42:17,489 --> 00:42:18,942
You don't need to thank.

531
00:42:19,058 --> 00:42:22,035
I owe a lot to you

532
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,566
this summer vacation I'm going to work part-time at my wife's crayon factory

533
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:28,840
Then see you later

534
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:30,262
, yeah, I'll be waiting

535
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:36,387
Make me some miso soup tomorrow morning

536
00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:37,488
No.

537
00:42:37,567 --> 00:42:40,012
You have an exam

538
00:42:40,070 --> 00:42:41,715
You have to eat properly.

539
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,504
Oh well, wait until tomorrow

540
00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:45,926
Please try not to fail

541
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,515
It's a close

542
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:50,020
try your best

543
00:42:51,772 --> 00:42:53,426
What time tomorrow?

544
00:42:53,536 --> 00:42:54,200
at 7:30

545
00:42:54,442 --> 00:42:55,247
How about you?

546
00:42:55,575 --> 00:42:56,762
We can go out with take-chan together.

547
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,652
Hmm, she's early for a pickle shop

548
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,614
I'll put up the sign tomorrow

549
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:05,355
I'll go early tomorrow and pack

550
00:43:07,318 --> 00:43:09,915
I should have worked instead of going to high school

551
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,317
Yeah.

552
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:12,996
so let's do our best

553
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:48,098
What's wrong?

554
00:43:51,770 --> 00:43:52,645
Hi

555
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,215
What's wrong?

556
00:44:00,879 --> 00:44:03,879
Let's play.

557
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:04,981
What?

558
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:07,574
You're going to have to pay again.

559
00:44:07,997 --> 00:44:08,911
It's free.

560
00:44:08,936 --> 00:44:09,997
It's free?

561
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:13,090
Let's go

562
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:21,286
I don't like it.

563
00:44:23,262 --> 00:44:26,262
I'll treat you to dinner later.

564
00:44:26,746 --> 00:44:27,746
I gonna play.

565
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,100
She is pretty good

566
00:44:34,125 --> 00:44:36,692
She's stylish

567
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,871
Does she buy her own clothes?

568
00:44:39,122 --> 00:44:40,020
She doesn't spend that much money

569
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,736
See, that's right

570
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,686
She has a swimsuit.

571
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:45,581
She has a sexy swimsuit

572
00:44:46,708 --> 00:44:48,145
I'll buy her a new swimsuit.

573
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:53,504
Hi.

574
00:44:56,543 --> 00:44:57,854
She is pretty good

575
00:44:57,879 --> 00:44:59,735
Just to play

576
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,504
She has good athletic ability

577
00:45:03,824 --> 00:45:05,695
What's the hell?

578
00:45:26,402 --> 00:45:27,825
Thank you for waiting.

579
00:45:29,316 --> 00:45:30,796
Please eat a lot

580
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:34,480
Please eat a lot

581
00:45:37,903 --> 00:45:42,004
Hi Ei-chan.

582
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:46,190
It's been a long time. I wonder how many years it has been since then?

583
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:47,961
Let's talk there

584
00:45:49,403 --> 00:45:50,325
Who?

585
00:45:52,673 --> 00:45:54,617
1,150 yen is needed.

586
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:02,036
Where did he go?

587
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,548
He's thinking of going to Tokyo for work soon

588
00:46:05,573 --> 00:46:08,032
So he's here now.

589
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:10,087
Shall I introduce you?

590
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:12,626
He's Tatsuoka-san

591
00:46:12,868 --> 00:46:13,626
I see.

592
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,149
I can't find him.

593
00:46:21,642 --> 00:46:22,696
Were you looking for him?

594
00:46:23,094 --> 00:46:26,080
Then I'll take 1,150 yen later

595
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:32,680
Do you have 150 yen?

596
00:46:33,025 --> 00:46:34,400
I have 50yen.

597
00:46:34,993 --> 00:46:36,189
100 yen.

598
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,017
Where did he go?

599
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:40,861
Shall I cancel this beer order?

600
00:46:41,368 --> 00:46:42,478
Don't say bullshit.

601
00:46:44,043 --> 00:46:46,219
You have money, right?

602
00:46:52,256 --> 00:46:54,992
I spent a lot of money on Take-chan

603
00:46:55,017 --> 00:46:56,064
I will pay for 30 yen.

604
00:46:58,892 --> 00:47:00,243
Thank you very much.

605
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:02,688
Because you said you wanted to come

606
00:47:03,673 --> 00:47:05,064
Where did he go?

607
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:08,329
Stop it....

608
00:47:09,883 --> 00:47:11,907
Please pay attention to his behavior

609
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:16,790
Well, I met a rare person called Tatsuoka

610
00:47:17,446 --> 00:47:19,380
He knows all about us.

611
00:47:19,656 --> 00:47:22,969
He also knew about Umeko's past lovers.

612
00:47:24,376 --> 00:47:25,454
You

613
00:47:27,134 --> 00:47:28,149
I have to pay the bill.

614
00:47:28,174 --> 00:47:28,736
I paid.

615
00:47:29,407 --> 00:47:30,384
I see

616
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:32,899
Thanks.

617
00:49:42,637 --> 00:49:44,168
Be quiet.

618
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:52,532
Yoshi-chan, you have to be strong,

619
00:50:07,267 --> 00:50:10,267
you have to be strong

620
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:12,754
What are you talking about?

621
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:19,968
Ah, give me your hand.

622
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:25,339
Were you waiting for your mother?
I guess that can't be helped

623
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,215
Seriously, You have not become less tolerant of alcohol.

624
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,418
You're probably drinking even more.

625
00:50:32,175 --> 00:50:33,722
I can't understand you

626
00:50:38,684 --> 00:50:42,332
She is your parent

627
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,426
She should sober up outside.

628
00:50:50,395 --> 00:50:51,879
Ah, give me your hand.

629
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:10,457
What's wrong?

630
00:51:11,779 --> 00:51:13,683
Are you coming home in the morning too?

631
00:51:13,723 --> 00:51:14,035
No.

632
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:18,629
I'm scared and have been outside since 1 o'clock

633
00:51:19,777 --> 00:51:21,925
I'm scared because my sister's brother is in the house.

634
00:51:22,317 --> 00:51:24,423
He does some weird things to me.

635
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:26,191
What happened?

636
00:51:26,465 --> 00:51:27,910
I can't tell you.

637
00:51:29,824 --> 00:51:31,363
Why?

638
00:51:31,419 --> 00:51:33,055
Why can't you remember?

639
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:36,051
My voice was like a rattling electron

640
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:41,387
That's a bit suspicious.
Your daughter was attacked.

641
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:44,144
He attacked you?

642
00:51:44,168 --> 00:51:44,715
Yes.

643
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:48,485
You say it easily

644
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:50,824
You are a virgin

645
00:51:50,988 --> 00:51:51,957
I don't understand him.

646
00:51:52,246 --> 00:51:53,535
He's married.

647
00:51:55,613 --> 00:52:02,683
Your brother's wife's brother did something strange to this girl

648
00:52:03,535 --> 00:52:06,051
Oh my god.

649
00:52:06,524 --> 00:52:08,457
You should kick him

650
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:13,183
She seems to have been waiting outside

651
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:17,989
Take care of her.

652
00:52:18,645 --> 00:52:20,137
I've been running away.

653
00:52:21,313 --> 00:52:23,316
You lost your virginity

654
00:52:23,551 --> 00:52:24,481
No.

655
00:52:25,746 --> 00:52:27,519
I ran outside

656
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:33,685
I was surprised.

657
00:52:37,262 --> 00:52:40,075
Mommy is looking for an apartment?

658
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,028
Yes.

659
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:49,260
Just leave home like this. I've been saying that for a while

660
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,347
You wouldn't find it

661
00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:57,332
We definitely leave the house

662
00:52:58,881 --> 00:53:03,183
Even if you say that, the deposit and the thank you money are expensive

663
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:10,090
Takako's aunt said she would be happy to take care of Take-chan.

664
00:53:10,495 --> 00:53:11,882
You were flattered.

665
00:53:11,907 --> 00:53:14,301
But she said it wouldn't work if my mother was there.

666
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:19,722
If he bought this for me, it will be expensive, so that's smart, right?

667
00:53:21,649 --> 00:53:23,575
Hey, I'm going to use this carefully now,

668
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:26,504
because I don't want to be bothered

669
00:53:28,227 --> 00:53:32,675
It's a bad habit to complain and take the blame for someone else's actions

670
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:36,585
I would buy a bag like this anytime.

671
00:53:37,772 --> 00:53:40,772
You don't do anything parental.

672
00:53:43,689 --> 00:53:48,386
You get angry when someone sympathizes with me.

673
00:53:48,931 --> 00:53:51,776
I want to do many things for you

674
00:53:51,956 --> 00:53:54,035
I never asked you to give birth.

675
00:53:57,470 --> 00:53:58,506
I sobered up.

676
00:53:58,530 --> 00:54:00,816
Come on, let's take you home

677
00:54:05,142 --> 00:54:07,706
aren't you supposed to be staying the night?

678
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,756
I'll go to the kawabe tomorrow and clean it up

679
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,780
I hope you come to my house and rest in peace

680
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,440
We're both in the same boat.

681
00:54:25,231 --> 00:54:26,004
Take

682
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:30,825
I don't want to go home

683
00:54:58,414 --> 00:55:01,414
I once had a crush on someone.

684
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:05,590
He was a store manager in Kyushu.

685
00:55:05,691 --> 00:55:07,223
Wasn't he from Shimizu?

686
00:55:07,647 --> 00:55:11,652
So he was on a big ship.

687
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:16,996
It went all the way out to the East China Sea,

688
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:20,410
and he caught shrimp, tuna, and tires,

689
00:55:20,785 --> 00:55:21,887
So?

690
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:24,371
He died.

691
00:55:24,722 --> 00:55:27,730
I met him in Kobe.

692
00:55:28,419 --> 00:55:30,699
and it was decided to follow him to Kyushu

693
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:34,150
I did leave this child with my grandma or something

694
00:55:35,970 --> 00:55:38,970
I was twenty-three years old

695
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:49,879
He was 28 years old and the eldest son of a sailor's family

696
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:02,441
For me, I was at a crossroads where I had
to decide whether to grab happiness or not

697
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:30,144
Is that the end?

698
00:57:31,231 --> 00:57:32,153
Yes.

699
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:37,543
I just mentioned that person's name,Takeko is always angry

700
00:57:42,424 --> 00:57:44,035
I'm home.

701
00:57:44,192 --> 00:57:45,739
Welcome back

702
00:57:47,956 --> 00:57:49,301
Oume is still sleeping?

703
00:57:49,418 --> 00:57:50,278
Yes.

704
00:57:50,778 --> 00:57:52,262
She looks like an owl

705
00:57:53,018 --> 00:57:55,605
She's  awake at night and taking a nap in the day

706
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,121
Have you done?

707
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,605
It's easy, you've already taken it off

708
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:06,121
Well, May I have some water?

709
00:58:06,356 --> 00:58:08,246
 Here's a glass

710
00:58:12,363 --> 00:58:17,836
If Umeko-san leaves the house, she won't be of any use to me.

711
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:23,590
what's going on.

712
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:27,740
On the second day, I brought my kid

713
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,840
After ten days, I got up and left again.

714
00:58:31,184 --> 00:58:32,028
For work?

715
00:58:32,153 --> 00:58:33,598
I don't know.

716
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,801
ten days

717
00:58:36,098 --> 00:58:39,778
I was still young, about 18 years old.

718
00:58:40,395 --> 00:58:41,676
You were reckless.

719
00:58:42,414 --> 00:58:43,965
What happened?

720
00:58:46,396 --> 00:58:51,668
No matter how young you are, you can't just go out like that

721
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:55,060
All I have to earn is milk

722
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:01,636
Hey, you're sleeping here,

723
00:59:02,614 --> 00:59:03,715
But you gave a birth.

724
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:05,418
It takes courage

725
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:08,660
It's just the way things are

726
00:59:09,030 --> 00:59:16,027
But you thought a lot about yourself.

727
00:59:16,652 --> 00:59:22,625
Raising a child is hard.

728
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:25,066
Where did  she go?  To the factory?

729
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:27,699
No.
She went to the pawn shop

730
00:59:28,222 --> 00:59:34,450
She put this baby on me again, no matter how many years pass, I'm still taking care of this baby.

731
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:39,301
They used it for Takeko even though they had been playing with themselves

732
00:59:40,226 --> 00:59:41,222
What's the hell?

733
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:43,496
Please don't fight again

734
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:45,285
She doesn't care about her brother

735
00:59:46,684 --> 00:59:47,926
How many days will she be here?

736
00:59:48,395 --> 00:59:51,395
Takeko?

737
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:56,894
He seems to have attacked takeko

738
00:59:57,082 --> 00:59:57,864
Really?

739
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:59,879
He teased her.

740
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:12,199
What's going on? What were you doing in this small house?

741
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:15,563
I was asleep though

742
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:19,296
That person is still planning to stay here for 5,6 days more.

743
01:00:19,672 --> 01:00:23,550
I thought she was a kid but she wasn't

744
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:29,605
Let him go home.

745
01:00:29,723 --> 01:00:35,535
I can't say that because I didn't pay for the food.

746
01:00:36,009 --> 01:00:37,816
You start again

747
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,645
By the way, Eisaku-san was at the center

748
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:45,152
He met that guy named Tatsuoka who used to come to my house a long time ago

749
01:00:45,778 --> 01:00:46,793
Who?

750
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,996
He often came to the store

751
01:00:49,637 --> 01:00:50,762
I see.

752
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:52,958
I wonder what he's doing now

753
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:54,762
It's none of my business.

754
01:00:55,004 --> 01:00:56,114
I'm home.

755
01:00:57,349 --> 01:00:59,535
Ah, welcome home

756
01:00:59,560 --> 01:01:00,559
What's that?

757
01:01:00,809 --> 01:01:03,090
Ah, that's just practice for tomorrow.

758
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:06,661
Your school's?

759
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:08,698
I borrowed a tape recorder.

760
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:11,909
I'm a club committee member, so I'll bring it tomorrow.

761
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:14,552
I'm hungry

762
01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:16,098
Eat some pickles.

763
01:01:16,605 --> 01:01:18,085
You're stingy

764
01:01:18,729 --> 01:01:20,404
Is there anything else?

765
01:01:20,526 --> 01:01:22,650
It's fine
I'm used to it anyway.

766
01:01:31,629 --> 01:01:33,969
This is awesome.

767
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:09,530
Do you know the house called Okesa around here?

768
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,149
Do you know?

769
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:14,243
Ogesa?
We don't know.

770
01:02:19,303 --> 01:02:21,648
Hey Ogesa i, over there

771
01:02:22,442 --> 01:02:23,255
over there

772
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:26,214
 oh, I see

773
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,140
Is this the Ogesa store?

774
01:02:54,951 --> 01:02:56,665
something I can help you with?

775
01:02:57,597 --> 01:02:59,964
I heard she works around here

776
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:01,477
Who?

777
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,770
her name written as Umeko

778
01:03:04,842 --> 01:03:07,515
Umeko? Ah Oume.

779
01:03:08,337 --> 01:03:10,865
They told me to go to Ogesa

780
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:15,444
I wouldn't know when she'd come back.

781
01:03:15,915 --> 01:03:17,820
We are in trouble.

782
01:03:18,082 --> 01:03:21,082
should I leave a message when she comes?

783
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:22,600
 Yes, that's right

784
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,900
I don't know because we can't open the bar.

785
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:29,820
Should I tell her when she gets home?

786
01:03:31,114 --> 01:03:32,154
Yeah.

787
01:03:33,939 --> 01:03:36,939
I'll tell her that.

788
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,940
Is that fine?

789
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:46,012
This is awesome.

790
01:03:47,150 --> 01:03:47,963
What are you going to do with it?

791
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:51,962
You did good job

792
01:03:53,436 --> 01:03:54,574
Are you okay?

793
01:03:54,918 --> 01:03:56,372
This is not crime.

794
01:03:57,567 --> 01:04:01,108
This is a hobby if I do this.

795
01:04:01,419 --> 01:04:02,480
I don't get it. .

796
01:04:02,545 --> 01:04:03,847
Please insert this

797
01:04:05,356 --> 01:04:06,828
Are you making money?

798
01:04:06,852 --> 01:04:08,356
No

799
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,206
I'm filming you too.

800
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:11,265
No way

801
01:04:11,721 --> 01:04:13,071
Don't think about strange things.

802
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:14,138
Shut up!

803
01:04:14,892 --> 01:04:17,892
This is it, do this, do that

804
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:22,610
I get it, I get it, it's easy,

805
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:23,710
What are you going to do with it?

806
01:04:23,883 --> 01:04:24,710
Shut up!

807
01:04:24,998 --> 01:04:26,127
Tell me

808
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:27,447
Get out.

809
01:04:32,940 --> 01:04:36,833
I'm counting on you.

810
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:38,992
OK

811
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,686
If you put this over there, it will do a good job.

812
01:04:44,403 --> 01:04:46,967
Let's do this job for a while..

813
01:04:47,399 --> 01:04:50,399
It can't be helped.
Are you sure?

814
01:04:58,675 --> 01:04:59,989
Are you sure?

815
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:02,407
It's going to be a good business

816
01:05:11,271 --> 01:05:12,365
I'm counting on you.

817
01:05:12,784 --> 01:05:14,471
Leave it to me.

818
01:05:33,593 --> 01:05:36,593
It's been ages.

819
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,258
I knew it

820
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:48,492
I asked about you

821
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:52,540
I've been searching around here and there for a while now

822
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:55,058
When did you back to Tokyo?

823
01:05:55,667 --> 01:05:56,494
I go and out

824
01:06:00,177 --> 01:06:01,203
Take a rest somewhere?

825
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,213
that place is just right.

826
01:06:09,563 --> 01:06:10,749
I miss you

827
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:13,756
I was about to miss you.

828
01:06:13,781 --> 01:06:15,235
You've gained weight too.

829
01:06:18,862 --> 01:06:20,629
I'm glad you came.

830
01:06:36,095 --> 01:06:37,222
Wanna change your clothes?

831
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:08,937
Yeah, how many years is too long? Thirteen or fourteen years?

832
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:15,059
I thought it was wrong to rely on you like this

833
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:18,980
I heard you were working so I assumed you were already married

834
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:25,167
What are you doing now?

835
01:07:26,345 --> 01:07:29,038
I’ve even raced in keirin before

836
01:07:30,090 --> 01:07:33,785
I put a lot of young things there, did some cleaning, and did some shed work

837
01:07:34,730 --> 01:07:36,511
Now I'm letting him running a pachinko parlor.

838
01:07:54,043 --> 01:07:55,324
hello?

839
01:08:03,956 --> 01:08:05,565
Yes, here are the snacks

840
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:08,058
You are considerate.

841
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:13,218
Would you like to take a bath?

842
01:08:14,046 --> 01:08:15,393
I got covered in dust over there.

843
01:08:16,010 --> 01:08:19,010
So as soon as I got ready, let you know.

844
01:08:30,042 --> 01:08:31,605
You made a lot of money today?

845
01:08:32,871 --> 01:08:33,792
What?

846
01:08:35,521 --> 01:08:36,804
What were you thinking?

847
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:41,588
 I was in a good mood right now

848
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,521
Let's remember the time in Kobe

849
01:08:45,165 --> 01:08:49,359
Having a dream?
Have a toast.

850
01:08:52,380 --> 01:08:53,461
Nice to see you again.

851
01:09:00,959 --> 01:09:03,959
It's been a while since I've felt this way

852
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,864
How is everyone?

853
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:10,155
Yes, how about you?

854
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:12,714
I have 3 sons

855
01:09:13,577 --> 01:09:14,604
In Tokyo?

856
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:16,254
They live in Kyushu

857
01:09:18,283 --> 01:09:19,784
Do you go back home sometimes?

858
01:09:19,918 --> 01:09:22,211
No, I live most of it in Kobe

859
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:29,260
I've changed, haven't I?

860
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:32,020
But why didn't you get married?

861
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:34,581
I can't.

862
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,428
Why not?

863
01:09:36,715 --> 01:09:40,321
All I thought about was my kids and I became an old lady.

864
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,861
Why did you think that?

865
01:09:46,055 --> 01:09:47,568
Oh, is that okay?

866
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:49,310
It's fine here,

867
01:09:53,550 --> 01:09:55,145
but it's bad. It's a bomb

868
01:09:55,170 --> 01:09:58,170
Because I'm in mood?

869
01:09:59,349 --> 01:10:00,662
Drink more.

870
01:10:01,350 --> 01:10:04,167
it's boring.

871
01:10:06,045 --> 01:10:07,491
You are so cute when you're drunk

872
01:10:08,209 --> 01:10:09,514
I'm not drunk yet

873
01:10:11,217 --> 01:10:13,153
Why did you quit the ship work?

874
01:10:15,014 --> 01:10:17,436
Since then, there have been many captures of fishing boats.

875
01:10:18,873 --> 01:10:27,068
So my parents' boat was taken away and I couldn't do business.

876
01:10:28,482 --> 01:10:32,170
I had no choice but to go to Kobe.

877
01:10:35,973 --> 01:10:37,396
That must have been a struggle

878
01:10:38,717 --> 01:10:41,069
Let's stop talking like this.

879
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,707
Excuse me.
the bath is ready.

880
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:56,287
Let's take a bath together for the first time in a while

881
01:11:20,835 --> 01:11:22,488
Give me a towel

882
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:23,830
Yes, yes, right now,

883
01:11:23,977 --> 01:11:26,643
Yone-chan, can you get a bath towel?

884
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,731
I'm late, sorry

885
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:41,141
Look at this.

886
01:11:41,627 --> 01:11:43,225
Hey, I can put under that bed, right? Oh,

887
01:11:43,250 --> 01:11:46,250
there was something like that

888
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:50,786
But what about the Master ?

889
01:11:51,604 --> 01:11:53,224
It's fine today

890
01:11:55,529 --> 01:11:56,896
Oh.

891
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:02,330
But you just brought this, didn't you?

892
01:12:02,592 --> 01:12:04,762
You've already brought a guest

893
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
You work too fast.

894
01:12:12,906 --> 01:12:16,903
I guess I'll just leave this here and there because it's so cold

895
01:12:18,003 --> 01:12:19,953
I have to hide this.

896
01:12:29,917 --> 01:12:32,610
Oh you finished?

897
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:37,115
It's just to remove sweat

898
01:12:59,362 --> 01:13:00,788
Do you want me to wash you?

899
01:13:00,813 --> 01:13:01,961
I'm embarrassed.

900
01:13:03,351 --> 01:13:04,671
You're adult

901
01:13:30,379 --> 01:13:31,692
It was good

902
01:13:57,297 --> 01:13:58,371
Hug me.

903
01:14:03,345 --> 01:14:04,758
Hug me.

904
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:29,116
Get stronger, yeah yeah

905
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,140
Faster..

906
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,986
More.

907
01:14:56,025 --> 01:14:57,211
Ready?

908
01:14:58,783 --> 01:15:00,477
Stretch your back

909
01:15:00,757 --> 01:15:01,684
What's this?

910
01:15:02,538 --> 01:15:04,518
This is some kind of recording.

911
01:15:26,265 --> 01:15:27,145
What's this?

912
01:15:27,946 --> 01:15:29,557
What is that?

913
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,102
What is that? You bastard!

914
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,586
Where are you going, Take-chan?

915
01:15:42,611 --> 01:15:44,330
I have something to ask Ume-san.

916
01:15:44,410 --> 01:15:45,524
What's wrong?

917
01:15:45,735 --> 01:15:46,868
On foot?

918
01:15:46,899 --> 01:15:49,340
I have no money for trains.

919
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:53,606
She took something important that I borrowed

920
01:15:53,636 --> 01:15:56,636
If I don't get it back today, I'll lose it

921
01:15:57,680 --> 01:15:58,801
What's the problem?

922
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,468
I'll see you again.

923
01:16:00,661 --> 01:16:01,548
I'll get mad.

924
01:16:08,720 --> 01:16:14,468
I see, so that's the kind of business you're in.

925
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:17,815
Is that bad?

926
01:16:18,302 --> 01:16:19,002
What?

927
01:16:19,946 --> 01:16:20,593
You are stupid.

928
01:16:21,747 --> 01:16:22,807
You're asshole

929
01:16:24,340 --> 01:16:27,340
Don't get angry and apologize!

930
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,840
I have not taken the tape yet.

931
01:16:33,395 --> 01:16:35,975
What was the song?

932
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:39,671
I just entered for dance practice,

933
01:16:41,417 --> 01:16:44,765
so who is that guy behind you?

934
01:16:44,872 --> 01:16:47,265
Forgive me....

935
01:16:48,177 --> 01:16:51,167
You ruined my mood.

936
01:16:52,806 --> 01:16:53,576
That's enough.

937
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,168
As a man, any more insults.

938
01:16:57,193 --> 01:16:58,410
don't say .

939
01:16:58,824 --> 01:17:01,196
Just doing this

940
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:04,220
I thought that doing it with you would be the most realistic experience

941
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:07,113
I gave in to temptation.

942
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,050
As a man, he went out of his way to visit his ex-girlfriend

943
01:17:12,147 --> 01:17:15,147
I want to show you this kind of shameless behavior

944
01:17:15,448 --> 01:17:16,241
Stop it....

945
01:17:25,077 --> 01:17:26,741
what are you going to do?

946
01:17:35,403 --> 01:17:37,811
I hate myself

947
01:17:38,023 --> 01:17:40,261
If you think about it, it's obvious

948
01:17:40,348 --> 01:17:42,035
Of course

949
01:17:42,809 --> 01:17:44,674
I really hate myself.

950
01:17:49,588 --> 01:17:52,588
Well, it can't be helped

951
01:17:53,959 --> 01:17:56,785
But the fact that you've fallen like that

952
01:17:56,810 --> 01:17:59,810
I'm responsible for it.

953
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:03,330
Why did you say something so kind to me?

954
01:18:06,474 --> 01:18:08,301
I'm sure you had a lot going on

955
01:18:09,833 --> 01:18:16,421
Actually, You remember Takeko?

956
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,660
I thought we would somehow find a place to live together

957
01:18:21,609 --> 01:18:24,105
I have to pay monthly rent for an apartment anyway

958
01:18:25,485 --> 01:18:27,142
If possible

959
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,370
I could buy a house

960
01:18:31,236 --> 01:18:32,849
Are you looking for a house?

961
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:42,775
that's not impossible

962
01:18:45,336 --> 01:18:48,336
But people live there and they won't leave

963
01:18:48,413 --> 01:18:49,989
Is it in your house?

964
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:51,832
I lent them.

965
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:57,876
He doesn't leave easily.

966
01:18:58,963 --> 01:19:04,149
Well, then,  you manage your business and moving there?

967
01:19:05,752 --> 01:19:07,472
That's a great offer.

968
01:19:08,201 --> 01:19:09,567
You can quit this job.

969
01:19:10,397 --> 01:19:13,856
Takeko will be glad.Thank you very much.

970
01:19:14,056 --> 01:19:15,570
Thank you very much.

971
01:19:15,936 --> 01:19:17,250
Let's talk about it later

972
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,516
Better put that thing away

973
01:19:19,541 --> 01:19:20,127
Yes

974
01:19:22,139 --> 01:19:23,679
Wanna record again?

975
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:25,760
No way.

976
01:19:25,865 --> 01:19:28,865
I'll just take it

977
01:19:34,684 --> 01:19:35,610
This is Kaneko.

978
01:19:37,474 --> 01:19:40,474
I thought I had to come and see you, but then...

979
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:44,076
Well, my wife seems to be doing well

980
01:19:44,707 --> 01:19:46,556
I'm thinking of going to the hospital now

981
01:19:46,580 --> 01:19:48,286
I let my child go first,

982
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:51,310
but anyway...

983
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,922
There's nothing wrong with her body. It's a brain disease

984
01:19:56,696 --> 01:20:00,123
I don't know when she suddenly feel unwell, no,

985
01:20:00,723 --> 01:20:02,558
There's no need to visit

986
01:20:04,010 --> 01:20:05,734
There's actually something I'd like to discuss with you

987
01:20:07,290 --> 01:20:11,390
Well, I'm worried too, but I have a few more things to say

988
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:16,310
Can't you come out and relax for a while?

989
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:19,742
I don't think that's a bad.

990
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:24,100
If your child is in the hospital, that's a good thing

991
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,620
And there's someone I'd like to introduce to you

992
01:20:28,544 --> 01:20:29,790
Welcome.

993
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:34,493
They are not lawyers. They're women

994
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:41,210
Anyway, I'm going to aim for it

995
01:20:45,192 --> 01:20:46,838
I won't say joke.

996
01:20:48,476 --> 01:20:51,112
make sure you have a seat somewhere cool

997
01:20:58,501 --> 01:21:00,715
when I put the hair dryer in,I got sweat.

998
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,076
Is this your friend's?

999
01:21:02,527 --> 01:21:06,235
I asked my friend who worked at beauty salon

1000
01:21:08,262 --> 01:21:10,348
You look young.

1001
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:11,255
Thanks

1002
01:21:12,693 --> 01:21:15,693
I need you to take this seriously

1003
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:19,868
One more beer

1004
01:21:21,761 --> 01:21:23,028
Be careful.

1005
01:21:23,686 --> 01:21:26,686
I firmly reject this as a married woman

1006
01:21:27,786 --> 01:21:29,189
I'll leave that to you

1007
01:21:29,990 --> 01:21:30,830
Here it is

1008
01:21:33,732 --> 01:21:36,732
I took up two rooms in Kozu

1009
01:21:37,084 --> 01:21:39,308
Now is busy season.

1010
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:42,333
If we have separate rooms now, that's fine

1011
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:50,163
I was thinking we could talk it over slowly

1012
01:21:52,996 --> 01:21:55,302
After all, it's a head diseases.

1013
01:21:55,366 --> 01:21:58,366
I don't want to spend my money this way for the rest of my life.

1014
01:21:59,208 --> 01:22:00,436
Even though things have settled down now..

1015
01:22:00,483 --> 01:22:01,363
Yeah.

1016
01:22:01,921 --> 01:22:05,711
For a long time now, whenever she gets discharged from the hospital, she get sick again

1017
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:08,407
Isn't it hereditary?

1018
01:22:08,627 --> 01:22:10,381
doctor said it was menopause.

1019
01:22:11,590 --> 01:22:13,486
I've had so many problems

1020
01:22:13,529 --> 01:22:16,875
That seems to have made me angry and I can't do it at all

1021
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:22,030
It would  be better if she die...

1022
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:24,922
that kind of thing will help her live longer

1023
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:30,750
Nobody comes there to buy shoes

1024
01:22:31,799 --> 01:22:33,485
I know you thought you had left

1025
01:22:33,510 --> 01:22:35,866
and think about your future behind

1026
01:22:36,009 --> 01:22:37,643
Can you make it through it?

1027
01:22:38,603 --> 01:22:40,313
I'm in difficult situation.

1028
01:22:41,326 --> 01:22:43,752
We'll think of ways to prosper

1029
01:22:44,729 --> 01:22:47,675
if you could consult with this person and take on the management side,

1030
01:22:47,767 --> 01:22:50,575
it would be good for both of them

1031
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:54,436
Well, let's talk slowly until we understand each other

1032
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:57,460
If you still want to quit after that, that's fine

1033
01:22:58,130 --> 01:23:01,130
Thank you for your kindness and for causing me so much worry

1034
01:23:01,390 --> 01:23:03,306
No, it's because of our convenience

1035
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:07,270
I've asked you to come here to come up with a solution for both sides

1036
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:11,977
Ah, stop here then

1037
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:25,541
Please take this.

1038
01:23:25,566 --> 01:23:26,299
That's enough.

1039
01:23:26,601 --> 01:23:29,067
If you call Kyutaro, I'll have him deliver money

1040
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,426
Sorry to bother you when you're busy

1041
01:23:31,450 --> 01:23:32,846
Even if you do go, you can take your time and then decline

1042
01:23:32,870 --> 01:23:35,870
if you think about it carefully

1043
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,661
Well, I'll be off then

1044
01:24:12,625 --> 01:24:16,887
Yeah, but it's pretty sudden, I have a family, sotoo

1045
01:24:16,925 --> 01:24:20,377
I think it's impossible to make a decision

1046
01:24:21,196 --> 01:24:25,652
I don't feel like making your wife cry just to get into marriage.

1047
01:24:26,255 --> 01:24:29,255
what is Tatsuoka's thinking?

1048
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:32,209
We don't have to get together

1049
01:24:32,496 --> 01:24:34,353
He'll take care of us?

1050
01:24:34,482 --> 01:24:36,301
That's right.

1051
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,879
It feels like the path is opening up

1052
01:24:39,870 --> 01:24:42,870
I also think he is a savior

1053
01:24:42,978 --> 01:24:44,241
That's right.

1054
01:24:46,752 --> 01:24:47,892
Please come over here

1055
01:24:50,604 --> 01:24:52,077
Please come over here

1056
01:24:52,913 --> 01:24:54,929
Oh please, please, please, please,

1057
01:24:58,973 --> 01:25:01,580
It's over there.

1058
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:06,100
We'll reserve two rooms for you just for tonight

1059
01:25:06,190 --> 01:25:09,190
He said he has an appointment tomorrow

1060
01:25:09,316 --> 01:25:10,943
We can stay different hotel tomorrow.

1061
01:25:13,220 --> 01:25:16,220
So, excuse me for tonight, I'll talk to you again tomorrow

1062
01:25:17,742 --> 01:25:19,466
Good night

1063
01:25:46,276 --> 01:25:47,523
that's not a joke.

1064
01:25:47,780 --> 01:25:48,967
You're club member.

1065
01:25:49,273 --> 01:25:50,556
How much is that?

1066
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:53,366
It costs 15,000 yen,  It's not mine.

1067
01:25:53,391 --> 01:25:55,475
It's irresponsibility

1068
01:25:55,576 --> 01:25:56,596
What should we do?

1069
01:25:56,788 --> 01:25:58,423
It won't be in time

1070
01:25:58,523 --> 01:26:00,359
It's your fault.

1071
01:26:00,570 --> 01:26:03,126
What are you going to do?

1072
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,445
But then It'll be responsible for everyone

1073
01:26:05,533 --> 01:26:07,279
You'll pay for it.

1074
01:26:08,045 --> 01:26:10,316
That's why I'm apologizing

1075
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:12,510
If you apologized ,the tape recorder back?

1076
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:14,401
so I could record some songs on it

1077
01:26:14,881 --> 01:26:15,908
It's your fault.

1078
01:26:16,209 --> 01:26:19,149
Is it possible that your family members don't know?

1079
01:26:19,513 --> 01:26:22,270
Well, maybe your mom took it to pawnshop.

1080
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:24,890
Well then, why don't you bring it out?

1081
01:26:25,043 --> 01:26:27,483
Please bring it out, poor thing.

1082
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,339
It's your parents' fault.

1083
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:53,859
What on earth happened to your mother?

1084
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:04,860
Please tell everyone that I'll come back sometime

1085
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:09,936
My grandma said she went to talk to the neighbors,

1086
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:12,960
but it wasn't worth the trouble of having someone call her,

1087
01:27:15,992 --> 01:27:18,992
so I guess the man is still there

1088
01:27:21,836 --> 01:27:23,647
Please be careful when I get home.

1089
01:27:23,843 --> 01:27:26,010
Don't worry.

1090
01:27:28,892 --> 01:27:32,805
Should I ask about the recorder when I go there

1091
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:35,215
 Everyone else is pretending not to know anymore.

1092
01:27:39,130 --> 01:27:40,590
Goodbye.

1093
01:27:41,304 --> 01:27:43,204
Goodbye.

1094
01:28:48,697 --> 01:28:50,793
where are you going alone in the middle of the night?

1095
01:28:52,116 --> 01:28:55,376
I was hanging out with a bunch of friends.
It's getting late so I'm walking home.

1096
01:28:56,006 --> 01:28:56,599
Where's your house?

1097
01:28:56,900 --> 01:28:57,647
 My house is nearby

1098
01:28:57,807 --> 01:28:58,414
Where?

1099
01:29:01,030 --> 01:29:02,988
Yamashita.

1100
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:05,372
So be careful

1101
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:20,548
Calling.

1102
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:22,806
Hello?

1103
01:30:23,095 --> 01:30:24,939
Oh, it's Take-chan?

1104
01:30:26,423 --> 01:30:28,064
Did the people at home say anything to you?

1105
01:30:30,314 --> 01:30:31,548
Are they looking for me?

1106
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:34,485
They haven't called me about anything.

1107
01:30:35,611 --> 01:30:36,338
I see.

1108
01:30:51,431 --> 01:30:53,673
She's tired after all.

1109
01:31:00,526 --> 01:31:01,860
I took the day off today

1110
01:31:02,048 --> 01:31:03,603
You didn't have to.

1111
01:31:03,861 --> 01:31:05,486
I was worried.

1112
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:10,211
If someone comes, I'll pretend you are not to be home.

1113
01:31:11,870 --> 01:31:14,274
You have to eat,

1114
01:31:14,408 --> 01:31:15,790
my heart is full.

1115
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,306
but you're not eating anything right?

1116
01:31:19,143 --> 01:31:20,165
Shall I reheat it for you?

1117
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,564
Don't worry.

1118
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:26,040
I have a headache

1119
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:28,906
How can I buy a tape recorder?

1120
01:31:28,986 --> 01:31:30,111
What if I find a job?

1121
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:32,815
I wonder if there's a place to live for work.

1122
01:31:32,840 --> 01:31:36,493
I think I'll just go back to part-time school

1123
01:31:38,206 --> 01:31:41,814
If you work, you'll find that it's hard to take care of yourself

1124
01:31:42,963 --> 01:31:45,963
but I don't want to go to school now

1125
01:31:51,184 --> 01:31:53,657
Hey, what are we going to do with this?

1126
01:31:54,681 --> 01:31:56,251
I don't know

1127
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,032
Where is Tatsuoka-san?

1128
01:31:59,462 --> 01:32:00,658
I don't know

1129
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:03,258
Where is my item?

1130
01:32:03,485 --> 01:32:08,426
Your wife came to get it.

1131
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:11,032
We paid the money and made the deal.

1132
01:32:14,180 --> 01:32:16,852
My wife doesn't do that.

1133
01:32:16,923 --> 01:32:18,595
She said you have a mistress.

1134
01:32:19,016 --> 01:32:20,806
She was very angry.

1135
01:32:24,634 --> 01:32:26,431
She's nice

1136
01:32:26,621 --> 01:32:27,673
Where is Tatsuoka-san?

1137
01:32:27,798 --> 01:32:28,837
Shut up!

1138
01:32:28,869 --> 01:32:31,972
We're just doing what we're told.
Please report your dissatisfaction to the person in charge.

1139
01:32:32,980 --> 01:32:34,563
Is that a pachinko?

1140
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:36,431
It could be.

1141
01:32:37,004 --> 01:32:38,641
So Tatsuoka-san need someone to do it?

1142
01:32:39,404 --> 01:32:41,219
It's none of your business.

1143
01:32:41,244 --> 01:32:44,571
All my stores are gone.

1144
01:32:45,110 --> 01:32:48,110
So Tatsuoka-san deceived me

1145
01:32:48,861 --> 01:32:50,462
Go outside.

1146
01:32:50,502 --> 01:32:51,267
Come on.

1147
01:32:51,410 --> 01:32:52,366
Ok get out

1148
01:32:52,390 --> 01:32:54,336
Come on.

1149
01:32:57,883 --> 01:33:00,883
Come on.

1150
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:03,914
Do you understand anything about this store?

1151
01:33:04,228 --> 01:33:05,509
This is just for sleeping.

1152
01:33:05,654 --> 01:33:07,274
What?

1153
01:33:09,493 --> 01:33:10,751
Bros.

1154
01:33:11,486 --> 01:33:13,220
Good morning.

1155
01:33:16,282 --> 01:33:18,094
This restaurant is great.

1156
01:33:18,423 --> 01:33:21,423
How many tables will you have?

1157
01:33:22,768 --> 01:33:25,768
With that in mind, we will place an order.

1158
01:33:26,126 --> 01:33:28,259
Did you order?

1159
01:33:31,254 --> 01:33:35,571
This window will have a seascape painted on it.

1160
01:33:36,621 --> 01:33:38,438
It's really nice

1161
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:43,856
So, I plan to have wives in their seventies or eighties

1162
01:33:47,657 --> 01:33:49,048
We were deceived

1163
01:33:49,298 --> 01:33:50,337
Who's she?

1164
01:33:50,462 --> 01:33:51,595
Tatsuoka's girl from Tokyo

1165
01:33:51,998 --> 01:33:55,931
This was where we were supposed to live

1166
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:57,774
Who is she?

1167
01:33:57,814 --> 01:33:58,923
I have no idea.

1168
01:33:58,948 --> 01:34:00,087
Who are you?

1169
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:01,165
What's the hell?

1170
01:34:01,938 --> 01:34:03,235
Tatsuoka told me to manage here.

1171
01:34:03,260 --> 01:34:05,415
He said I'm gonna manage this place.

1172
01:34:05,813 --> 01:34:06,946
He said I'm gonna manage this place.

1173
01:34:06,994 --> 01:34:09,032
Please talk to him directly

1174
01:34:09,057 --> 01:34:11,009
Let's go

1175
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:15,032
Where is Tatsuoka ?

1176
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,868
It's troublesome when things are different

1177
01:34:18,770 --> 01:34:20,016
What are you doing?

1178
01:34:20,041 --> 01:34:21,322
Hey.

1179
01:34:21,347 --> 01:34:23,509
Get out.

1180
01:34:28,485 --> 01:34:29,450
But it's a bargain

1181
01:34:30,204 --> 01:34:32,615
I think this place is very good

1182
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,384
Really.

1183
01:34:46,326 --> 01:34:48,281
I called and they said he was there,

1184
01:34:50,681 --> 01:34:52,259
I am so angry.

1185
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:58,220
He was the one who got me out of gambling,

1186
01:34:59,077 --> 01:35:02,077
He took my store and took it over in a planned way

1187
01:35:03,328 --> 01:35:06,328
He used you

1188
01:35:07,467 --> 01:35:09,837
That's the kind of person he was.

1189
01:35:10,525 --> 01:35:11,665
I was also an idiot

1190
01:35:12,282 --> 01:35:14,248
I have a crazy wife

1191
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,977
How do I restart at this age?

1192
01:35:17,572 --> 01:35:18,611
You were deceived by him too.

1193
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:20,540
It seems so

1194
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:27,440
I thought it was strange, but I didn't think you were bad

1195
01:35:27,603 --> 01:35:28,852
I let my guard down

1196
01:35:29,244 --> 01:35:30,837
It can't be helped.

1197
01:35:34,060 --> 01:35:38,993
I was made fun of because I'm Korean.

1198
01:35:43,954 --> 01:35:46,048
More Beers

1199
01:36:00,759 --> 01:36:04,195
He's connected the Matsuda gang.

1200
01:36:04,220 --> 01:36:07,306
I will not be afraid to take revenge.

1201
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:09,063
I can throw my life away either.

1202
01:36:10,275 --> 01:36:12,970
I don't need to live

1203
01:36:36,200 --> 01:36:41,040
I'll wait for him here and get my revenge.

1204
01:36:44,228 --> 01:36:45,337
See you.

1205
01:36:53,049 --> 01:36:55,813
Well, I may not see you again,

1206
01:36:55,838 --> 01:36:57,044
but please stay healthy

1207
01:36:57,408 --> 01:36:58,478
You too.

1208
01:36:59,572 --> 01:37:00,851
Thanks to you.

1209
01:37:15,994 --> 01:37:17,158
it was like a fun dream

1210
01:37:18,970 --> 01:37:24,149
At the very least, I'll remember it as a fun memory

1211
01:37:56,869 --> 01:38:00,142
Umeko.

1212
01:38:04,846 --> 01:38:09,844
She's been going crazy like this for about four days.

1213
01:38:10,963 --> 01:38:12,751
Sorry

1214
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:19,360
Please eat.

1215
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:32,899
Umeko

1216
01:38:40,485 --> 01:38:43,626
A member of the Jindo Club is visiting.

1217
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,486
We are moral Club

1218
01:38:48,970 --> 01:38:54,462
She wants you to join her group.

1219
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:07,235
That's good?

1220
01:39:09,538 --> 01:39:10,415
That's good?

1221
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,415
She'll be right away.

1222
01:39:18,915 --> 01:39:22,689
I've been a guest here for a while now

1223
01:39:23,430 --> 01:39:25,798
I finally felt relieved

1224
01:39:28,340 --> 01:39:33,360
All the kids went to the beach today.

1225
01:39:35,205 --> 01:39:38,205
Apparently Takeko's been staying with a friend

1226
01:39:39,369 --> 01:39:41,715
so I haven't seen her around lately

1227
01:39:42,075 --> 01:39:43,704
it's summer vacation.

1228
01:39:43,892 --> 01:39:45,525
I heard she won't be coming home

1229
01:39:49,421 --> 01:39:53,914
The Morality Association is a very trustworthy organization.

1230
01:39:54,308 --> 01:39:58,595
I invite people who are worried about various things

1231
01:39:59,270 --> 01:40:05,290
The membership fee is 100 yen, huh? They give you pamphlets and books at cost

1232
01:40:05,821 --> 01:40:10,061
Five hundred yen can brighten up the problems in your life

1233
01:40:11,150 --> 01:40:14,861
It may seem a little expensive, but it's actually cheap

1234
01:40:14,894 --> 01:40:21,509
People with personality problems can improve their character by practicing this type of religion.

1235
01:40:21,857 --> 01:40:23,226
Yes,that's it.

1236
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:28,050
So people who cause a lot of trouble to other people

1237
01:40:28,930 --> 01:40:31,930
I'm very grateful.

1238
01:40:33,020 --> 01:40:37,404
I thought that bad people were just born that way

1239
01:40:37,497 --> 01:40:39,652
I guess they don't even try to fix it.

1240
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:43,886
That's what makes them spirit of self-denial

1241
01:40:44,266 --> 01:40:48,169
That means no effort has been made

1242
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:51,961
So the love you have with your children ends up in conflict with your family

1243
01:40:52,093 --> 01:40:54,649
That's too bad.

1244
01:40:54,753 --> 01:40:57,753
Now I'm here, so we try our best.

1245
01:40:58,340 --> 01:41:02,963
If my eyes get crushed , I'll probably pay for the funeral myself

1246
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:04,391
Until then,

1247
01:41:06,154 --> 01:41:07,354
So.

1248
01:41:07,834 --> 01:41:11,007
I feel sorry for your.

1249
01:41:11,786 --> 01:41:15,260
You have to be a good son. You're still young

1250
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:19,760
You have to try somehow, even now

1251
01:41:21,130 --> 01:41:22,245
That's right.

1252
01:41:24,848 --> 01:41:27,257
I'm not saying anything bad, so try it.

1253
01:41:29,305 --> 01:41:34,117
You should think about your own future and participate in this meeting.

1254
01:41:34,450 --> 01:41:36,220
That's better than sleeping at home.

1255
01:41:36,245 --> 01:41:39,110
I don't mind either way

1256
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:41,540
You have to go.

1257
01:41:47,450 --> 01:41:50,450
Thank you very much.

1258
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:55,250
People who suddenly become different people are like that

1259
01:41:56,504 --> 01:41:58,446
I hope she gets better.

1260
01:42:00,345 --> 01:42:01,665
It's cheap.

1261
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:10,134
Are you working now?

1262
01:42:10,507 --> 01:42:13,368
I'm on work.

1263
01:42:14,679 --> 01:42:17,125
It can't be helped.

1264
01:42:19,567 --> 01:42:25,907
Yeah, she always stayed over at her friends' houses because her parents are bad.

1265
01:42:26,673 --> 01:42:30,954
I can't scold her too harshly.

1266
01:42:31,441 --> 01:42:34,441
She is already 17 years old

1267
01:42:35,603 --> 01:42:37,439
She is very rebellious

1268
01:42:39,266 --> 01:42:41,407
Thank you very much.

1269
01:42:43,758 --> 01:42:45,172
Thank you very much.

1270
01:42:45,197 --> 01:42:47,736
I'm going out because I have an appointment.

1271
01:42:48,096 --> 01:42:49,345
See you

1272
01:42:49,712 --> 01:42:51,478
What?

1273
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:56,704
She is very hopeless

1274
01:42:57,056 --> 01:43:00,869
Please come back here soon

1275
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:03,353
What's the hell?

1276
01:43:14,696 --> 01:43:17,068
Everything is doing well.

1277
01:43:18,756 --> 01:43:22,634
Well, when you display it like this, it doesn't look like a used item

1278
01:43:22,884 --> 01:43:24,189
Bros.

1279
01:43:32,797 --> 01:43:33,477
Hey

1280
01:43:37,431 --> 01:43:38,837
what's wrong?

1281
01:43:41,960 --> 01:43:45,321
My wife noticed about here.

1282
01:43:46,622 --> 01:43:48,610
She asked me who's in charge here.

1283
01:43:52,744 --> 01:43:54,486
Let's go

1284
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:57,306
For tonight.

1285
01:43:58,083 --> 01:43:59,243
What are you talking about?

1286
01:44:02,597 --> 01:44:04,453
Instead, I'll let you know something.

1287
01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:18,045
Kaneko is going to kill you

1288
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:25,200
I don't care about people like you

1289
01:44:25,230 --> 01:44:27,076
If there was a commotion like a murder,

1290
01:44:27,100 --> 01:44:30,891
We are also inconvenienced.
Let you know.

1291
01:44:34,118 --> 01:44:35,657
Thank you very much.

1292
01:44:39,259 --> 01:44:40,993
Let's talk slowly tonight

1293
01:44:43,281 --> 01:44:46,884
I didn't know you were that kind of guy.

1294
01:44:47,369 --> 01:44:48,556
What are you talking about?

1295
01:44:49,295 --> 01:44:51,493
but life is important

1296
01:44:51,518 --> 01:44:53,118
Wait at coffee shop over there

1297
01:44:53,143 --> 01:44:54,767
I have to go

1298
01:44:54,792 --> 01:44:56,275
Hold on.

1299
01:44:57,814 --> 01:44:59,087
Hold on.

1300
01:44:59,860 --> 01:45:02,156
I'll have to go back to Kyushu for a while, otherwise I'll have to take care of things

1301
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:05,180
Then I won't come back for a while.

1302
01:45:05,420 --> 01:45:07,156
Please go home

1303
01:45:07,180 --> 01:45:10,180
I don't want you to come in front of me again.

1304
01:45:10,205 --> 01:45:11,775
What's wrong?

1305
01:45:18,072 --> 01:45:19,494
Run away!

1306
01:45:41,838 --> 01:45:43,439
Stop it....

1307
01:45:44,002 --> 01:45:45,361
Stop it....

1308
01:45:46,986 --> 01:45:48,588
Stop it....

1309
01:45:55,146 --> 01:45:57,204
Bring him out.

1310
01:46:43,409 --> 01:46:45,103
I'm unlucky

1311
01:46:45,447 --> 01:46:47,572
I lost everything.

1312
01:46:48,150 --> 01:46:50,836
I was so close to having my clothes ripped off

1313
01:46:50,861 --> 01:46:53,799
That is my house.

1314
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:57,759
I envy people who have a house.

1315
01:47:00,530 --> 01:47:02,626
Are you related to Section Chief Okabe?

1316
01:47:03,892 --> 01:47:04,603
No way.

1317
01:47:06,142 --> 01:47:11,876
He was fired for embezzling company funds.

1318
01:47:13,859 --> 01:47:16,335
The police came to investigate

1319
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,360
Okabe's crime was discovered

1320
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:23,517
I took a sleeping pill. It didn't work?

1321
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:25,955
You idiot.

1322
01:47:27,100 --> 01:47:31,642
I was trying to stop him.

1323
01:47:32,533 --> 01:47:34,431
But I almost died

1324
01:47:37,176 --> 01:47:39,525
He did a good.

1325
01:47:40,549 --> 01:47:42,260
It's hard.

1326
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:01,270
Oh well

1327
01:48:01,295 --> 01:48:02,895
, that's fine, that's fine

1328
01:48:02,973 --> 01:48:04,622
It's hard to walk.

1329
01:48:04,818 --> 01:48:07,818
They sleep like the dead.

1330
01:48:10,303 --> 01:48:11,509
Are you okay?

1331
01:48:12,657 --> 01:48:15,657
Don't step on their heads

1332
01:48:17,114 --> 01:48:19,020
Takeko's back?

1333
01:48:20,333 --> 01:48:23,325
It's hot.
I'll open the door.

1334
01:48:27,654 --> 01:48:29,762
it's cool as expected

1335
01:48:32,863 --> 01:48:35,559
They'll get up in two hours

1336
01:48:35,963 --> 01:48:38,963
Then I am be able to sleep comfortably

1337
01:48:51,450 --> 01:48:52,598
Water is stopped.

1338
01:49:00,810 --> 01:49:02,207
Hey.

1339
01:49:04,598 --> 01:49:05,442
Again?

1340
01:49:07,090 --> 01:49:10,918
what have you been up to?

1341
01:49:11,890 --> 01:49:13,666
Where were you?

1342
01:49:13,691 --> 01:49:15,582
Takeko's back.

1343
01:49:15,607 --> 01:49:18,075
She's come back then that's fine

1344
01:49:21,966 --> 01:49:26,184
She left a note and ran away.

1345
01:49:27,043 --> 01:49:28,815
She's here

1346
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:31,458
Where did that paper go?

1347
01:49:34,133 --> 01:49:36,879
I will look for it.

1348
01:49:38,345 --> 01:49:40,514
This is this

1349
01:49:41,031 --> 01:49:42,689
in the drawer...

1350
01:49:45,470 --> 01:49:48,470
She left this in the drawer and left the house

1351
01:49:48,520 --> 01:49:52,575
But no one notices it because everyone is so sloppy.

1352
01:49:53,730 --> 01:49:55,081
I had no idea.

1353
01:49:56,811 --> 01:50:01,370
When she came back and asked me if I'd seen it,I told her I didn't know,

1354
01:50:01,950 --> 01:50:05,457
This is how it all happened," so it's no wonder she was so disappointed.

1355
01:50:08,012 --> 01:50:09,278
It can't be helped.

1356
01:50:10,760 --> 01:50:13,760
You've never made a promise to anyone like a parent before

1357
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:15,906
Right?

1358
01:50:17,665 --> 01:50:18,638
Did you do anything?

1359
01:50:19,629 --> 01:50:20,269
Hey.

1360
01:50:21,169 --> 01:50:22,555
Say something.

1361
01:50:24,198 --> 01:50:25,298
what?

1362
01:50:26,810 --> 01:50:28,089
Well, that's right

1363
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:35,392
She left the house and no one made a fuss

1364
01:50:35,690 --> 01:50:38,690
No one was going to report it to the police or have her search for it

1365
01:50:38,943 --> 01:50:40,674
We are too sloppy.

1366
01:50:42,902 --> 01:50:46,951
If anything happens to her, I'm sorry.

1367
01:50:49,715 --> 01:50:50,575
What are you doing?

1368
01:50:51,483 --> 01:50:53,597
You are her parent

1369
01:50:53,815 --> 01:50:56,805
But in the end she came home

1370
01:50:56,830 --> 01:50:59,036
but it's your child

1371
01:50:59,215 --> 01:51:01,027
But in the end she came home

1372
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:05,034
I will ask her for more details later.

1373
01:51:11,254 --> 01:51:13,543
you brought someone again

1374
01:51:13,576 --> 01:51:16,051
You've brought someone along before.

1375
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:20,356
I felt sorry for him so I left him alone

1376
01:51:20,380 --> 01:51:22,574
I don't want to be the one who was taken care of either

1377
01:51:22,599 --> 01:51:24,520
What do you think this house is?

1378
01:51:25,132 --> 01:51:26,059
Get out.

1379
01:51:26,084 --> 01:51:27,910
Come in.

1380
01:51:28,934 --> 01:51:29,418
Get out.

1381
01:51:29,443 --> 01:51:30,114
No.

1382
01:51:30,684 --> 01:51:32,567
Get out.

1383
01:51:33,581 --> 01:51:35,387
It hurts

1384
01:51:42,994 --> 01:51:44,152
Yeah, what are you doing?

1385
01:51:51,036 --> 01:51:53,106
I'm your mom

1386
01:51:57,043 --> 01:51:58,958
Go to hell

1387
01:52:04,910 --> 01:52:06,434
Stop it....

1388
01:52:08,528 --> 01:52:10,168
Stop it....

1389
01:52:21,600 --> 01:52:23,051
Cut it out.

1390
01:52:26,692 --> 01:52:27,903
Cut it out.

1391
01:52:34,121 --> 01:52:37,121
Just kill me.

1392
01:52:38,723 --> 01:52:42,379
I don't care if you kill me.

1393
01:52:49,801 --> 01:52:51,090
Just kill me.

1394
01:53:48,058 --> 01:53:49,464
You're so bad.

1395
01:53:56,712 --> 01:53:59,712
Takeko,where are you going?

1396
01:54:00,675 --> 01:54:02,823
I'm never coming back here again

1397
01:54:06,472 --> 01:54:07,425
Takeko!

1398
01:54:11,461 --> 01:54:13,875
I found a live-in job.

1399
01:54:18,340 --> 01:54:19,079
Goodbye.

1400
01:54:23,163 --> 01:54:23,999
Takeko!

1401
01:54:26,529 --> 01:54:27,935
Takeko!

1402
01:54:30,137 --> 01:54:31,083
Takeko!

1403
01:54:33,184 --> 01:54:34,633
Takeko!

1404
01:54:36,003 --> 01:54:37,221
Takeko!

1405
01:54:37,819 --> 01:54:40,116
Bring her back, ok?

1406
01:54:42,073 --> 01:54:43,081
Takeko!

1407
01:54:45,956 --> 01:54:46,651
Takeko!

1408
01:54:49,103 --> 01:54:52,103
Takeko! This

1409
01:54:55,792 --> 01:54:57,425
Take this.

1410
01:55:12,241 --> 01:55:15,241
Takeko,take this.

1411
01:56:10,061 --> 01:56:10,735
See you.

1412
01:56:18,726 --> 01:56:20,493
Go by car.

1413
01:56:20,814 --> 01:56:21,806
No.

1414
01:56:39,736 --> 01:56:40,688
Goodbye.

1415
01:57:03,814 --> 01:57:06,298
Don't cry,Takeko.

1416
01:59:13,361 --> 01:59:23,590
THE END

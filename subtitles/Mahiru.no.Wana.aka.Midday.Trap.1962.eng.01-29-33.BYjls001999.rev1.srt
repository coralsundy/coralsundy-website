00:00:16,374 --> 00:00:19,093
Tokyo, a large city with a population of 10 million

3
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:21,891
Tokyo is the center of the Japanese economy

4
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,766
Tokyo dominates Japan.

5
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:29,226
People gather in Tokyo for power

6
00:00:30,703 --> 00:00:34,883
Young people are on a course to excel in high school and college.

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,617
And compete and win the entrance exam.

8
00:00:40,148 --> 00:00:45,484
They have to fight for a career after joining the company

9
00:00:47,172 --> 00:00:50,328
They are busy with competition every day

10
00:00:51,586 --> 00:00:55,148
There are many terrifying traps in this world

11
00:00:56,593 --> 00:01:04,906
Midday trap

12
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:58,336
That document will be ready soon

13
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,961
Yes here it is

14
00:02:01,016 --> 00:02:02,125
My opinion is different

15
00:02:02,727 --> 00:02:05,016
In the old days, products were sold only by brand name

16
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:06,422
But it's different now

17
00:02:06,867 --> 00:02:09,188
I think the quality and price of the product is important

18
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:13,820
But from the European market, you don't have to think so pessimistically

19
00:02:13,922 --> 00:02:15,570
You're not thinking straight.

20
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,734
Your thoughts were completely useless at the last planning meeting

21
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,250
Especially about private railway metal companies

22
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,641
OK I get it

23
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,648
Thank you

24
00:02:24,883 --> 00:02:27,078
Fuji-kun, I'm sorry but

25
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:31,656
Put together a report on the company's oil demand outlook in 10 years.

26
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:32,305
Yes

27
00:02:32,898 --> 00:02:34,133
Here is the document

28
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:37,867
Mr. Tokue, the chief of staff, is no good

29
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:40,492
They both joined the company at the same time.

30
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:43,355
Mr. Furuya failed to work four years ago

31
00:02:44,027 --> 00:02:47,527
Even so, Mr. Fuji is 32 years old and is the chief of staff.

32
00:02:49,492 --> 00:02:51,242
Mr. Fuji will be the section chief in three years.

33
00:02:52,414 --> 00:02:54,180
Then Mr. Fuji will rise faster than Mr. Miyama.

34
00:02:54,594 --> 00:02:55,938
He will definitely be an executive in the future

35
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:01,992
Fuji-san told me that Salary men have to join a prestigious company.

36
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:05,648
And work hard at the company

37
00:03:07,117 --> 00:03:09,367
And to marry a beautiful woman

38
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:09,977
I see

39
00:03:10,953 --> 00:03:12,727
So Fuji-san is still single

40
00:03:12,766 --> 00:03:13,289
Yes he is

41
00:03:14,938 --> 00:03:16,383
He has a lot of plans

42
00:03:17,594 --> 00:03:18,383
Thank you for your work

43
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:18,977
Thank you

44
00:03:20,203 --> 00:03:20,883
Fuji-san

45
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,164
I need to talk with you

46
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,891
Sorry, I'm busy

47
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:34,180
Ready!

48
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:41,211
How many times have you done this?

49
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,195
Today is the 6th day

50
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,063
You are pretty good

51
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,117
Thank you

52
00:03:57,593 --> 00:03:58,523
You're not very good at this.

53
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:00,969
I was doing right way

54
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:12,477
Is it Churchill?

55
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,930
I don't know.
This is my first time

56
00:04:16,273 --> 00:04:16,797
No wonder

57
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:18,328
Why?

58
00:04:18,586 --> 00:04:25,656
Because first-timers are slow to shoot, or you were very fast to shoot.

59
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:27,977
I wasn't aiming for the target.

60
00:04:28,398 --> 00:04:28,976
Fuji-kun

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,453
Are you going back?

62
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:34,601
I need to go for some places

63
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,273
I want to be here too, but I'll leave the rest to you

64
00:04:38,398 --> 00:04:38,914
I see

65
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:39,586
See you

66
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,156
See you

67
00:04:43,945 --> 00:04:44,734
Is he your company person?

68
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:45,703
He is my boss

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,367
He was studying abroad in England so he has a lot of orders

70
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:51,484
But your seem to be smarter

71
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:52,625
Not at all

72
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,516
Do you still want to continue?

73
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:56,586
Yes please

74
00:04:57,312 --> 00:04:58,344
Why don't you join me?

75
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:02,406
Well...I'm not good at shooting

76
00:05:02,523 --> 00:05:03,984
I apologize to you what I said

77
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:08,882
When will you come next?

78
00:05:09,516 --> 00:05:10,531
Why you ask me?

79
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:14,039
I want to teach you because you are so beautiful

80
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:16,773
But I'm sure you'll be disappointed

81
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:27,742
Fuji-san is not coming yet

82
00:05:28,133 --> 00:05:31,266
He either comes early and waits or comes late

83
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,523
I heard that shooting costs money

84
00:05:34,548 --> 00:05:35,617
I think so

85
00:05:35,867 --> 00:05:38,234
According to him, golf is obsolete.

86
00:05:38,656 --> 00:05:40,297
Anyway he is great

87
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,781
He always does things as calculated

88
00:05:44,148 --> 00:05:47,102
He is steadily on the career track

89
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,055
He is cool

90
00:05:48,344 --> 00:05:52,758
Watch out for him.
To him a woman is like a cigarette

91
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:55,008
I like a pale man like him

92
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,882
He is the type who splits up immediately after sleeping with a woman

93
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:00,852
You still like him?

94
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,695
Some women can't leave him.

95
00:06:03,844 --> 00:06:05,547
You seem confident

96
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,218
Why don't you go out with him?

97
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:08,172
I should?

98
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:10,633
I can go out with him

99
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:11,953
Hey you!

100
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:15,422
Mr. Furuya seems to be annoyed

101
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:19,617
Furuya,
How is your relationship with that beautiful female doctor?

102
00:06:20,398 --> 00:06:21,133
Why you ask me?

103
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:22,523
It's not your business

104
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,648
It seems that there are many men who like her

105
00:06:25,984 --> 00:06:27,344
Fuji-san often see her too

106
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,545
I'm sure he'll succeed if he makes a move.

107
00:06:30,906 --> 00:06:32,023
He has come

108
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:33,180
Hi

109
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,867
Welcome,
you seem to be busy

110
00:06:36,297 --> 00:06:37,297
Welcome,

111
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:39,063
We were talking about you

112
00:06:39,088 --> 00:06:41,843
Talking bad about people who aren't there is a stress reliever for office workers.

113
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,578
It's good to think about career advancement, but be careful of women

114
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:45,641
Can I have a splash of water, please?

115
00:06:46,195 --> 00:06:49,289
I offer my abilities and make money

116
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,523
My private life is none of your business.

117
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:04,570
Mr. Domoto will talk about the progress of sales to Southeast Asia.

118
00:07:05,195 --> 00:07:06,945
He wants to meet you

119
00:07:09,078 --> 00:07:10,266
Excuse me for a while

120
00:07:10,961 --> 00:07:12,047
What's wrong?

121
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:22,086
Sorry I made you wait

122
00:07:23,438 --> 00:07:27,906
I'll get right on it.
The draft of the expansion plan of Toyo Metal has been completed.

123
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,437
so I brought it to you

124
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,234
Oh thank you

125
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,734
Please tell Domoto and Miyazaki to come here

126
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,406
By the way

127
00:07:39,359 --> 00:07:41,140
Are you hiding something from me?

128
00:07:41,517 --> 00:07:42,851
Am I?

129
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:46,273
I'm not hiding anything from you

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,414
That's what I thought but

131
00:07:48,773 --> 00:07:51,695
Please state clearly what you want to know

132
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:57,070
Actually, I heard strange rumors today

133
00:07:58,273 --> 00:08:02,805
I heard that Ueki-kun will be removed from the board of directors in the next executive re-election.

134
00:08:03,414 --> 00:08:04,203
Is that true?

135
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:05,664
No way

136
00:08:06,852 --> 00:08:08,250
He will of course be reelected

137
00:08:08,773 --> 00:08:09,578
I think so

138
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:16,679
You know the relationship between me and Ueki-kun.
I don't think you'll do that because you're the president

139
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,234
Hello?

140
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:25,641
Fuji-san,
Kasumi-san has come to see our president. why he has come?

141
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,375
I think it was a personnel change, so I did some digging.

142
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:32,523
But I have no idea

143
00:08:36,492 --> 00:08:38,523
This is a bullshit article.

144
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:42,703
I will buy the information from you high

145
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:48,133
Hello? Ok connect to me

146
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,320
Hello?

147
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:54,359
I'm Fuji

148
00:08:55,227 --> 00:08:56,859
Yes, that's fine

149
00:08:57,602 --> 00:08:58,398
6pm?

150
00:09:00,148 --> 00:09:01,289
I'm waiting in the usual place

151
00:09:02,148 --> 00:09:02,531
See you then

152
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:11,602
Suzuki-kun

153
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,227
Yes

154
00:09:12,336 --> 00:09:15,578
I'm going out.
Please tell the chief that you will be back at 5 o'clock

155
00:09:15,695 --> 00:09:16,133
Yes

156
00:09:16,172 --> 00:09:17,086
Fuji-san...

157
00:09:19,819 --> 00:09:22,342
Please give me some information

158
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:48,553
Welcome

159
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:49,522
Is she in?

160
00:09:50,725 --> 00:09:51,663
Do you want to see her?

161
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:53,608
Hi

162
00:09:53,858 --> 00:09:54,491
Welcome

163
00:09:54,858 --> 00:09:55,991
Please come in

164
00:09:56,147 --> 00:09:56,608
Thanks

165
00:09:58,451 --> 00:10:01,638
You know what.
Did you see someone from my company?

166
00:10:02,046 --> 00:10:03,382
Well..I have no idea

167
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:09,678
Excuse me

168
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,116
Are you sure you're okay to come to work?

169
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,553
I have a small favor of you

170
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:16,022
What is it?

171
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:17,780
I worry

172
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:21,874
Actually, please lend me 20,000 yen by the 25th

173
00:10:23,303 --> 00:10:23,850
20,000 yen?

174
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:24,350
Yes

175
00:10:24,921 --> 00:10:25,647
What for?

176
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,944
I have to spend money suddenly tonight

177
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:30,272
It's okay if it doesn't work

178
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,991
Why you ask me?

179
00:10:32,678 --> 00:10:35,178
It's the closest I could get.

180
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,616
I am very honored to be asked

181
00:10:37,866 --> 00:10:38,546
Thanks

182
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,882
Please write a loan book for the time being

183
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:43,053
I will

184
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:44,874
For sure

185
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,788
Fuji!

186
00:11:44,132 --> 00:11:44,882
Are you free tonight?

187
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:47,069
No, I'll have something to do

188
00:11:47,288 --> 00:11:48,499
I have something to talk to you

189
00:11:50,022 --> 00:11:50,538
Say it here

190
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:54,671
Actually.I want to ask you about Ms. Akatsaka

191
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,616
Furuya,
Tell you clearly

192
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:02,139
I'm not interested in Ms.Akatsuka at all

193
00:12:04,303 --> 00:12:05,608
I'm relieved to hear that

194
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:10,257
I tell you. I'll marry to her

195
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:11,686
Don't say any more

196
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:14,491
It's none of my business

197
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:15,405
See you

198
00:12:27,491 --> 00:12:28,225
What's wrong?

199
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:35,241
I feel strange,
When I first met you at the shooting range, I thought you were just a girl

200
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:36,772
Now?

201
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,397
I'm getting confused about you

202
00:12:41,264 --> 00:12:41,850
Really?

203
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,530
Do you investigate my identity?

204
00:12:45,857 --> 00:12:46,631
I gave up it

205
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:54,444
But You are a woman I have never met

206
00:13:00,272 --> 00:13:01,374
You check time often

207
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:03,913
Because I need to go

208
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:14,014
I wonder who wait for you

209
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,483
Well...you said you gave up to investigate my identity

210
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,467
Hello? call me a cab

211
00:13:23,007 --> 00:13:23,991
And bill please

212
00:13:25,741 --> 00:13:26,717
Let me pay

213
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:27,639
Oh

214
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:30,007
I have money today

215
00:13:34,835 --> 00:13:35,694
When can I see you next time?

216
00:13:38,413 --> 00:13:39,850
I'll call you

217
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:48,842
Sorry

218
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:21,577
What's wrong?

219
00:14:22,147 --> 00:14:23,452
I have something to talk with you

220
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:24,624
What?

221
00:14:28,983 --> 00:14:29,921
Tell me quickly.

222
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:35,983
I'm going to have a baby.

223
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:39,522
Anyway Come home

224
00:14:59,147 --> 00:15:02,921
Last time I gave you 10,000 yen to get an abortion.

225
00:15:04,663 --> 00:15:07,475
I'll return this money.

226
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,163
Who said return this?

227
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,037
I tell you many times

228
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,889
It just happened on a company trip.

229
00:15:15,811 --> 00:15:19,662
It wouldn't have happened if you weren't drunk

230
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:26,115
In other words we were just out of luck with each other

231
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:32,381
Do you want to give birth to a child to take revenge on me?

232
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,740
Why you are having my baby?

233
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,662
Because I want a baby

234
00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:38,123
You want a baby?

235
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,295
Even so, I won't marry you

236
00:15:44,287 --> 00:15:46,342
You love Ms.Akatsuka,right?

237
00:15:46,935 --> 00:15:47,583
Who said that?

238
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:49,014
No one told me

239
00:15:49,834 --> 00:15:51,155
So You're just saying crap

240
00:15:56,131 --> 00:15:59,889
You are pregnant but  I don't know if it's my child

241
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:02,639
I heard you were playing a lot with  guys

242
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:04,553
Fuji-san

243
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,240
There is a call from Akatsuka

244
00:16:07,905 --> 00:16:08,381
Thank you

245
00:16:16,256 --> 00:16:19,264
Hello?
Why you know this phone number?

246
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,162
You gave me your business card

247
00:16:22,373 --> 00:16:23,021
Oh I see

248
00:16:23,998 --> 00:16:27,772
Can you keep it secret that you met me?

249
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,912
You don't have to worry about it.
 I won't tell anyone.

250
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,561
Humans are complex creatures.

251
00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:36,498
Because a woman is over 30 years old and single is strange

252
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:38,029
Not only for women

253
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:39,466
Yeah

254
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,451
I know Yasue Moniya is there

255
00:16:44,764 --> 00:16:45,459
Why you know?

256
00:16:47,819 --> 00:16:49,780
I'm thinking of moving

257
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:52,280
All the bad things happen lately

258
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,037
Really?

259
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:55,537
I believe you have an introduction to marriage.

260
00:16:56,123 --> 00:16:56,780
Mr.Furuya?

261
00:16:58,709 --> 00:17:01,334
He is a very pure man

262
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,951
Ah,Fuji-kun

263
00:17:27,389 --> 00:17:28,389
The director is calling you

264
00:17:28,428 --> 00:17:29,100
I get it

265
00:17:34,217 --> 00:17:37,076
Did you go to Akasaka yesterday?

266
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,350
No.
I went to Ginza, why?

267
00:17:40,717 --> 00:17:42,084
It was a mistake

268
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:46,740
Trends in the Asian market of West German affiliates

269
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,865
They are investigating sales plans for biomachines

270
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:50,802
Right?

271
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:51,248
Yes

272
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:52,662
Send a telegram to the Berlin dead right now.

273
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:53,428
Yes

274
00:17:54,647 --> 00:17:55,444
Oh,Fuji-kun

275
00:17:56,662 --> 00:18:02,795
It was decided at the board meeting yesterday.
I want you to go to Europe if you are not inconvenient

276
00:18:03,608 --> 00:18:05,451
What? to Europe?

277
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:11,983
If you're going, you'll leave in the middle of next month, and the duration will be a year.

278
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,600
in the middle of next month?

279
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,576
Is there something wrong?

280
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:17,850
Well..no

281
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:20,537
I was surprised to hear that out of the blue.

282
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:25,896
I want you to do an export job when you return

283
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,381
Thank you

284
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:30,170
How old are you now?

285
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,076
I'm 32

286
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:38,061
Managing Director Domoto studied abroad when he was 35 and I was 37.

287
00:18:39,615 --> 00:18:40,623
You are lucky

288
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:44,295
You are one of the best executive candidates

289
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:45,842
Good luck

290
00:18:47,748 --> 00:18:48,662
Thank you very much

291
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,170
That's very sudden.

292
00:18:53,303 --> 00:18:58,022
If you leave in the middle of next month, you only have about 20 days left.

293
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:58,920
Yeah

294
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,881
So please meet me

295
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,069
yeah, when?

296
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:06,389
Tomorrow, Sunday

297
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,303
Then I'll be waiting at the usual place

298
00:19:10,006 --> 00:19:11,709
No, I'll visit your home

299
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:12,662
What?

300
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:14,467
I'm not comfortable outside

301
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:15,756
But...

302
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:16,483
IS that bad?

303
00:19:57,217 --> 00:19:58,389
What's wrong with you?

304
00:19:59,084 --> 00:20:00,030
Come in

305
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:08,662
Are you interested in where I live?

306
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:11,998
I don't mean that

307
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:16,217
You want to know who I am,right?

308
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,045
How many years are you going to Europe?

309
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:29,451
About a year

310
00:20:32,162 --> 00:20:32,819
That's so long

311
00:20:35,084 --> 00:20:38,444
I'll be lonely without you

312
00:20:41,803 --> 00:20:43,912
I go to the shooting range alone again

313
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,889
I had a strange relationship with you

314
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,725
I don't want to leave you without knowing anything about you.

315
00:21:02,647 --> 00:21:06,467
When you found out we were splitting up, you became very bossy.

316
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,451
I love you

317
00:21:28,451 --> 00:21:29,155
What?

318
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:33,662
You know why I'm here?

319
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,959
I found this place to be the safest.

320
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:44,264
If you meet with me, no one will come to see you today.

321
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,740
Don't say that, please.

322
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,780
From the beginning you didn't think I was a normal female, right?

323
00:22:55,162 --> 00:22:55,803
But...

324
00:22:56,287 --> 00:22:59,342
Didn't you think I'm Kasumi-san's woman?

325
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:06,911
Are you scared?

326
00:23:08,227 --> 00:23:12,592
He is very powerful

327
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,520
He's easy to fire me

328
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,740
You'll leave from me?

329
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:28,849
I'll take you away from him.

330
00:23:55,115 --> 00:23:55,716
Good morning

331
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,654
I'm sorry

332
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,834
You don't seem to look at the newspaper

333
00:24:10,834 --> 00:24:12,341
Ms. Akatsuka was killed

334
00:24:13,693 --> 00:24:14,177
What?

335
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:16,771
Good morning

336
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,974
Was she killed by a robbery?

337
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:27,904
There was no mention of it in the papers.

338
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,091
I'm sorry

339
00:24:30,466 --> 00:24:32,505
For you and for her

340
00:24:32,724 --> 00:24:34,396
I had nothing to do with it.

341
00:24:35,209 --> 00:24:35,873
You sure?

342
00:24:36,771 --> 00:24:39,248
It can be dangerous to have a woman alone

343
00:24:39,974 --> 00:24:41,216
You had better get married early

344
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:43,115
With the father of the child on your stomach

345
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:44,599
Fuji-san

346
00:24:46,037 --> 00:24:47,966
The truth is, I'm not pregnant.

347
00:24:48,732 --> 00:24:49,466
Good morning

348
00:24:55,419 --> 00:24:57,364
I didn't do it because Akatsuka-san taught me to lie.

349
00:24:58,075 --> 00:24:59,013
She taught you?

350
00:24:59,802 --> 00:25:00,404
Yes

351
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:06,654
I got angry when I heard from Mr. Furuya about your relationship with Ms.Akatsuka

352
00:25:07,552 --> 00:25:12,709
I told her about a company trip with you in addition to the results of the pregnancy test

353
00:25:14,044 --> 00:25:17,216
I thought it would be good for her to get away from you.

354
00:25:17,802 --> 00:25:19,826
I'm sorry but I didn't love her

355
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,834
Oh she said same

356
00:25:24,748 --> 00:25:27,654
So she told me to lie that I was pregnant

357
00:25:28,294 --> 00:25:30,560
I thought you might be willing to get married

358
00:25:31,794 --> 00:25:33,709
I thought I could get a reward from you even if it didn't work

359
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,373
You look very troubled.

360
00:25:40,294 --> 00:25:44,567
I think the police will investigate the person related to her

361
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,654
But don't worry,
I won't talk anything

362
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,310
I decided to quit the company and get married this month

363
00:26:04,537 --> 00:26:05,537
Good morning

364
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,294
It seems that Dr. Akatsuka was killed.

365
00:26:14,591 --> 00:26:16,177
Hey, cheer up

366
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:23,959
I don't know what you think but
She is not the subject of your marriage

367
00:26:26,982 --> 00:26:30,279
You suspected that I and she had a relationship

368
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,552
I went to her hospital to get money from her

369
00:26:34,365 --> 00:26:34,888
Money?

370
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,248
Of course there was interest

371
00:26:37,544 --> 00:26:38,146
Damn it

372
00:26:39,216 --> 00:26:41,169
The loan book I wrote the other day should be at her place

373
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:43,834
That's inconvenient

374
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,443
Let me see the news paper

375
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:18,849
No matter where you are last night, it has nothing to do with the murder

376
00:27:20,685 --> 00:27:21,412
I don't think so.

377
00:27:22,826 --> 00:27:24,779
I have a loan book I wrote in her house

378
00:27:26,162 --> 00:27:26,927
loan book?

379
00:27:28,138 --> 00:27:31,904
Actually, I borrowed 20,000 yen from her a week ago

380
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:37,591
If the police find it, the police will look into my alibi

381
00:27:39,669 --> 00:27:43,060
But what time was that person killed yesterday?

382
00:27:44,021 --> 00:27:46,599
It seems to be around 3 pm

383
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,412
3 pm?

384
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:55,388
So What will you do?

385
00:27:57,255 --> 00:28:00,880
I can't tell anyone I've met you.
No one know that

386
00:28:02,951 --> 00:28:06,248
Only you can prove my alibi

387
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:16,357
Just in case, If they find out about my relationship with Himako...

388
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:19,216
Mr.Kasumi will get angry

389
00:28:20,294 --> 00:28:22,396
I may get rid of the company

390
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,247
I need alibi

391
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:27,998
Thinking too much makes my head hurt

392
00:28:28,974 --> 00:28:31,138
I need a natural alibi

393
00:28:32,482 --> 00:28:33,044
Oh yeah!

394
00:28:49,248 --> 00:28:52,560
It's unusual for him to come to the bar alone and drink so much

395
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,709
He's a little crazy today

396
00:28:57,396 --> 00:28:59,373
He also has that kind of thing

397
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,466
Oh welcome

398
00:29:01,802 --> 00:29:03,130
Let's drink again

399
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,802
Your executive...

400
00:29:08,021 --> 00:29:09,162
That dirty man

401
00:29:09,216 --> 00:29:10,365
Mr.Domoto?

402
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,732
I'll toast for him

403
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,701
I'll toast for Yuzaki department chief

404
00:29:17,052 --> 00:29:17,880
Cheers!

405
00:29:21,052 --> 00:29:22,310
let's toast for Oike department chief

406
00:29:22,591 --> 00:29:25,201
He works so hard,
Cheers!

407
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,771
I'll toast for Miyama department chief

408
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,489
Miyama?
I hate him

409
00:29:33,318 --> 00:29:34,193
What's wrong?

410
00:29:36,185 --> 00:29:37,662
It's non of your business

411
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:40,255
I'll toast for Fuji chief

412
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,833
You are so nice today

413
00:29:43,858 --> 00:29:46,068
You seem to have an ulterior motive.

414
00:29:46,341 --> 00:29:48,099
It's up to you

415
00:29:48,201 --> 00:29:50,091
Because you are still single

416
00:30:01,224 --> 00:30:01,990
What time is it?

417
00:30:02,709 --> 00:30:04,091
It's 10 am

418
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,685
I had seven years of no tardiness, no absenteeism, and it was for nothing.

419
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,912
Because you drunk so much

420
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:11,716
I also have a hangover

421
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:18,857
Did you have anything with Mr. Miyama?

422
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,974
Well...nothing

423
00:30:24,537 --> 00:30:25,193
Why you ask me?

424
00:30:26,357 --> 00:30:30,404
You were in a bad mood when you talked about him yesterday

425
00:30:33,872 --> 00:30:34,701
I was?

426
00:30:36,654 --> 00:30:38,857
I'm drunk so I don't remember anything

427
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:50,513
You OK?

428
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,435
I'll take this

429
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,162
Are you Satoru Fuji?

430
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:08,044
Yes

431
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,474
We are the police.
We would like to talk to you about Ms. Akatsuka's case.

432
00:31:13,833 --> 00:31:14,201
OK

433
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:22,349
You mean that loan book?

434
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:26,099
I suddenly needed money for a private matter

435
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:29,771
You are the chief of a large company, right?

436
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:32,060
You are single, right?

437
00:31:32,466 --> 00:31:34,232
I don't save money

438
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:37,771
Our salary is not as good as you think

439
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:42,810
If I have a special relationship with her, I won't write a loan book

440
00:31:43,458 --> 00:31:44,162
I see

441
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:49,888
By the way,Where were you between 2 pm and 4 pm when the incident happened?

442
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:53,310
That's a very unpleasant question for me

443
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:54,583
I'm sorry

444
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,990
Because this is my job

445
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:01,646
Ask as many people as I can, the more chances I have of finding a clue.

446
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:02,544
Please understand us

447
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,646
I was watching a movie at the cinema that time

448
00:32:06,154 --> 00:32:06,919
Ar star cinema?

449
00:32:07,552 --> 00:32:08,052
Yes

450
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:12,005
Did you meet someone in the cinema?

451
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,755
Well...there was nothing.

452
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:22,060
And I heard that there is a person in your company who has a special relationship with her.

453
00:32:22,966 --> 00:32:24,364
I have no idea

454
00:32:24,404 --> 00:32:28,380
We just refer to it.
I'll keep what you say secret

455
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:33,419
My colleague Furuya said he wanted to marry her

456
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:34,794
Mr.Furuya

457
00:32:35,044 --> 00:32:35,568
And?

458
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,841
He sometimes went to her clinic

459
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,802
Please make a copy of this minutes

460
00:32:48,827 --> 00:32:50,599
Ah, chief

461
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:51,318
What?

462
00:32:51,591 --> 00:32:53,505
Is it true that Mr. Furuya was called by the police?

463
00:32:55,841 --> 00:32:58,997
Police are investigating who was in and out of her clinic

464
00:33:00,537 --> 00:33:01,701
They has asked me

465
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,552
They has asked you?

466
00:33:03,577 --> 00:33:04,115
Yes

467
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:09,169
The section chief is calling you

468
00:33:10,716 --> 00:33:11,443
Hello

469
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:15,068
I get it

470
00:33:16,091 --> 00:33:16,857
I'll go there now

471
00:33:21,662 --> 00:33:22,693
Welcome

472
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:25,654
Hi

473
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:28,138
How are you?

474
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:30,708
I thought it was not good to talk at the company

475
00:33:31,513 --> 00:33:32,341
Is it because of the police?

476
00:33:34,044 --> 00:33:35,622
I felt very unpleasant

477
00:33:36,529 --> 00:33:38,349
The police are suspicious of you too

478
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:44,630
Mr. Furuya also said he's going to marry Mr. Akatsuka, so he's quite suspected by the police.

479
00:33:45,052 --> 00:33:49,576
He had an alibi because he was hiking to the mountains that day with a colleague from the company

480
00:33:51,068 --> 00:33:54,287
By the way The police have asked me a lot about you

481
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:56,287
You have an alibi, right?

482
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,130
Yes I was watching a movie

483
00:34:00,216 --> 00:34:00,888
That's good

484
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:03,286
I'm sorry to worry you

485
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:07,263
Anyway, the police are very persistent when they suspect something.

486
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:10,810
I think you should prove your innocence early

487
00:34:10,872 --> 00:34:11,427
I know

488
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,201
Let me tell you something else.

489
00:34:15,076 --> 00:34:17,763
Did you hear anything from Director Yuzaki?

490
00:34:19,435 --> 00:34:19,802
Well

491
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,935
I see.
You've been through a lot, haven't you?

492
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:27,865
I think you don't have to worry because you have an alibi

493
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:29,966
I was relieved to hear that

494
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:34,638
By the way, about your study abroad in Europe

495
00:34:36,544 --> 00:34:38,701
That has been postponed

496
00:34:40,169 --> 00:34:44,888
The company wants to let you go after your innocence has been proven.

497
00:34:45,802 --> 00:34:48,177
So you need to wait

498
00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:01,771
Do the police trust what you said?

499
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:04,396
I have no idea

500
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:09,419
What if your alibi isn't recognized?

501
00:35:18,662 --> 00:35:22,396
Then I have no choice but to talk about you

502
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:27,669
It's not good.
If you tell them that, we're over

503
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,716
So What will you do?

504
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:36,638
I have no choice but to find the culprit myself

505
00:35:39,576 --> 00:35:43,287
I absolutely have to find the culprit who is annoying us

506
00:35:44,529 --> 00:35:46,185
It's the only way to save me.

507
00:35:48,294 --> 00:35:50,880
I'm so scared

508
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:55,396
Don't worry. you'll be fine

509
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:59,521
I'll handle it.

510
00:36:02,302 --> 00:36:06,208
Oh..She was murdered, wasn't she?

511
00:36:07,075 --> 00:36:07,911
Is that true?

512
00:36:08,005 --> 00:36:08,576
Yes

513
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:10,732
I'm sorry

514
00:36:10,779 --> 00:36:14,560
By the way, The man she brought with her, is he a regular here?

515
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,317
He is not

516
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:17,826
But you know about him,right?

517
00:36:18,779 --> 00:36:21,404
I can't talk about customer information

518
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:24,740
This is for keeping quiet.

519
00:36:26,966 --> 00:36:28,763
I only know his name

520
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:30,802
He is a person who speaks Osaka dialect called Mr. Sonoda.

521
00:36:30,827 --> 00:36:31,161
Osaka dialect?

522
00:36:31,224 --> 00:36:31,568
Yes

523
00:36:31,593 --> 00:36:32,544
What kind of work does he do?

524
00:36:32,654 --> 00:36:35,966
He said he was in the finance business in Hibiya.

525
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,052
Thank you for waiting

526
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:54,958
Who lives here now?

527
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:56,154
teacher ’s aunt.

528
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,240
Is she a doctor after all?

529
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,263
No,She is a Christian grandmother

530
00:37:01,076 --> 00:37:03,912
Can I work in your company's medical office?

531
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,857
I am qualified as a nurse

532
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:08,505
You had better ask Miyama than to me

533
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:09,591
I don't like him

534
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:10,607
Why?

535
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:11,622
Well...

536
00:37:12,716 --> 00:37:14,919
Oh yeah,
I'd better to ask Yuzaki

537
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:16,138
He ’s the director, right?

538
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,755
Has he ever come?

539
00:37:17,919 --> 00:37:19,162
Yes 4,5 times before

540
00:37:22,646 --> 00:37:27,052
What kind of questions were you asked by the police?

541
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:30,216
They asked who was often coming

542
00:37:31,029 --> 00:37:31,537
Then

543
00:37:32,669 --> 00:37:33,912
I told them all I knew

544
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:37,490
Tokioka and Futuya from the Yachiyo company

545
00:37:37,779 --> 00:37:38,810
and you

546
00:37:38,835 --> 00:37:40,490
You told them about me

547
00:37:41,201 --> 00:37:42,818
Is Tokioka a person in the sales department?

548
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,646
Did Miyama also come often?

549
00:37:47,404 --> 00:37:50,068
He was here a lot, but he was quiet.

550
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,490
Do you know a man called Sonoda?

551
00:37:54,849 --> 00:37:55,599
Sonoda?

552
00:37:56,005 --> 00:37:57,521
He is a financial company who speaks Osaka dialect

553
00:37:57,919 --> 00:38:00,388
I don't know.
There was no such person in the patient

554
00:38:00,896 --> 00:38:01,747
Give me some water

555
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:08,466
Why do you think she was killed?

556
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:11,646
The police asked me that, but I don't know

557
00:38:12,326 --> 00:38:13,669
What did she do on her days off?

558
00:38:14,076 --> 00:38:15,802
She always went out late at night

559
00:38:17,419 --> 00:38:18,427
She had a date?

560
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,982
I'm not privy to any personal secrets.

561
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:22,544
That's personal

562
00:38:23,177 --> 00:38:24,607
You are educated

563
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:26,224
Here it is

564
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:27,935
What is this?

565
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:32,176
I don't want any hush money.

566
00:38:32,201 --> 00:38:34,951
I don't mean that.
Go see a movie with your boyfriend next vacation

567
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:36,919
Bill please

568
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:49,013
Thank you for waiting

569
00:38:49,247 --> 00:38:51,318
Please come in

570
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:54,271
So what can I do for you?

571
00:38:54,779 --> 00:38:56,067
I want to ask you something

572
00:38:56,092 --> 00:38:56,700
Ok

573
00:38:57,341 --> 00:38:59,107
You're talking about profit?

574
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:04,208
What was your relationship with Yayoi Akatsuka?

575
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:06,372
Yayoi Akatsuka?

576
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:10,451
You were in a fight with her in Akasaka 5 days before she was killed,right?

577
00:39:13,802 --> 00:39:17,974
You know very well so I can't pretend I don't know

578
00:39:19,310 --> 00:39:23,029
She and I are acquaintances at the time of Osaka medical university

579
00:39:23,568 --> 00:39:24,162
Osaka medical university

580
00:39:24,451 --> 00:39:25,177
Yes

581
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:29,677
I met her when I was hospitalized for a stomach ulcer

582
00:39:29,974 --> 00:39:32,685
She was working at a hospital in Osaka at that time

583
00:39:32,943 --> 00:39:34,576
I loved her at first sight

584
00:39:34,974 --> 00:39:35,951
But she didn't like me

585
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:40,458
But I realized she likes money

586
00:39:40,747 --> 00:39:42,607
So I spent money on her

587
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:45,497
I introduced her to stocks and land

588
00:39:46,154 --> 00:39:48,044
Made her about 50 million profits

589
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:52,091
So I could have sex with her one time

590
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:55,654
But that one was the problem

591
00:39:56,216 --> 00:40:00,052
Since then I have never forgotten about her

592
00:40:01,037 --> 00:40:09,434
Actually, I called her because I wanted to take about sea business with her

593
00:40:10,255 --> 00:40:10,966
sea business?

594
00:40:11,037 --> 00:40:11,943
It's sea

595
00:40:12,388 --> 00:40:17,716
It ’s about making money on landfill rights.

596
00:40:18,662 --> 00:40:23,880
I told her I would mediate if she wanted to resell in the future

597
00:40:24,607 --> 00:40:26,943
However, the landfill was decided last year.

598
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:31,583
The price went up because a company in Tokyo said it would buy the right

599
00:40:31,927 --> 00:40:32,951
The price has increased 12 times

600
00:40:33,576 --> 00:40:36,630
So I tried to mediate that

601
00:40:36,966 --> 00:40:38,177
But she turned it down

602
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,669
She broke her promise.

603
00:40:41,341 --> 00:40:43,474
I told her to sleep with me if so

604
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:46,029
I spoke like this

605
00:40:46,232 --> 00:40:47,302
But it turned out that way.

606
00:40:49,693 --> 00:40:54,669
I was busy having been in Osaka for about 3 days

607
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:57,154
And I was surprised to see the newspaper

608
00:40:58,724 --> 00:41:01,505
So you were in Osaka on the day of the case

609
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:04,466
Yes, I went to Arima with my wife

610
00:41:04,708 --> 00:41:07,154
Come to think of it I was lucky

611
00:41:07,747 --> 00:41:12,060
If I were in Tokyo I would have been suspected like you guys

612
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,419
Thank you for everything

613
00:41:18,372 --> 00:41:19,818
You have bad taste.

614
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:25,021
You don't need me to reminder of my bad experiences.

615
00:41:25,046 --> 00:41:27,122
If you don't like it, please say it clearly

616
00:41:27,654 --> 00:41:30,162
You used to have something with Chief Miyama

617
00:41:30,708 --> 00:41:32,333
I don't even want to hear his name

618
00:41:34,638 --> 00:41:36,724
I had a relationship with him for about a year

619
00:41:37,934 --> 00:41:39,708
Why do you hate him now?

620
00:41:41,935 --> 00:41:44,380
He wanted to borrow 300,000 yen from me.

621
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:45,724
From you?

622
00:41:46,287 --> 00:41:50,240
I was surprised.
He used to give me money

623
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:56,388
I was so angry that I told the madam of the bar about it.

624
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:58,708
Then Madame, on the contrary, got angry with me

625
00:41:59,458 --> 00:42:01,669
But for some reason did you need such a lot of money today?

626
00:42:02,912 --> 00:42:04,224
He seems to have had a problem with his wife

627
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:11,208
He married the daughter of an executive in order to get ahead in his career.

628
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:13,076
I didn't know that

629
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:20,201
It seems that his wife's husband's company went bankrupt and needed money.

630
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:22,303
How much?

631
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:25,092
He said 5 million yen

632
00:42:25,685 --> 00:42:26,748
He made the money?

633
00:42:28,185 --> 00:42:29,279
Well...I have no idea

634
00:42:30,099 --> 00:42:32,935
He said he would borrow money from a financial institution at a high interest rate

635
00:42:34,506 --> 00:42:36,138
Then he stopped seeing me

636
00:42:38,154 --> 00:42:39,818
Humans without money are scary

637
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:51,763
To be honest,I don't want to investigate Chief Miyama with you.

638
00:42:52,607 --> 00:42:55,232
But the criminal who killed her may be in front of us

639
00:42:55,834 --> 00:42:57,748
I'm sure there was something happening to Miyama and her

640
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:00,857
It's none of my business

641
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,342
But you were thinking of marrying her, right?

642
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:05,599
Don't you want to know who killed her?

643
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:06,545
No

644
00:43:06,888 --> 00:43:07,365
Why?

645
00:43:07,693 --> 00:43:08,826
I loved her but

646
00:43:09,724 --> 00:43:11,982
In fact, I thought I'd marry her to win you over.

647
00:43:12,326 --> 00:43:14,638
Hey,win me over?

648
00:43:15,662 --> 00:43:16,576
What do you mean?

649
00:43:17,107 --> 00:43:20,631
I was going to use her to destroy you.

650
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:27,154
I thought I had to spend money because I wasn't talented

651
00:43:27,467 --> 00:43:29,810
Hey you really mean it?

652
00:43:30,521 --> 00:43:31,638
I mean it

653
00:43:32,521 --> 00:43:35,928
But she was killed and the plan was ruined

654
00:43:37,295 --> 00:43:38,162
But fortunately

655
00:43:39,615 --> 00:43:40,873
I wasn't the only one whose plans collapsed

656
00:43:42,006 --> 00:43:44,803
You also made a bad impression on your work in this case

657
00:43:45,779 --> 00:43:48,896
I'll tell you what.
I don't work with you

658
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,342
What should I do?

659
00:43:56,592 --> 00:43:57,920
Miyama is certainly suspicious

660
00:43:58,748 --> 00:44:02,193
But I can't do anything alone

661
00:44:04,068 --> 00:44:05,576
The police haven't asked me anything since.

662
00:44:06,381 --> 00:44:09,271
Police may not even pursue my alibi

663
00:44:10,224 --> 00:44:10,857
Fuji-kun

664
00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:12,607
What is this?

665
00:44:13,092 --> 00:44:15,029
This does not show the movement of the economy

666
00:44:16,131 --> 00:44:19,295
I don't think I'm doing a subjective analysis

667
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:21,037
Don't flatter yourself.

668
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:24,935
Your work these days is useless

669
00:44:25,435 --> 00:44:29,287
And you're no good at leading your subordinates.

670
00:44:30,357 --> 00:44:32,388
You are the section chief

671
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:38,373
chief

672
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,529
Stop saying it in front of everyone

673
00:44:42,092 --> 00:44:42,584
What?

674
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:45,326
It's a loss to turn me into an enemy

675
00:44:45,943 --> 00:44:46,888
What do you mean?

676
00:44:47,592 --> 00:44:51,865
I know the problem of your personal life

677
00:44:53,451 --> 00:44:56,217
I have no secret not like you

678
00:44:57,107 --> 00:44:58,568
Rewrite the report anyway

679
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,896
The police are here,Fuji chief

680
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:24,193
Let's talk here

681
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:25,623
about the case?

682
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:26,740
I'll contact them

683
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:27,763
Thanks

684
00:45:35,263 --> 00:45:35,771
Come in

685
00:45:41,162 --> 00:45:41,592
Sit down

686
00:45:47,232 --> 00:45:47,818
We are ready

687
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:48,529
I see

688
00:45:50,857 --> 00:45:52,037
I'm Inspector Tadokoro at the headquarters

689
00:45:52,935 --> 00:45:54,545
I will ask you a little for reference

690
00:45:57,162 --> 00:46:01,248
I heard that your personal life was pretty disturbed

691
00:46:04,037 --> 00:46:08,099
You weren't in a normal state of mind,right?

692
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:12,232
You didn't have to kill her

693
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:14,607
Don't say bullshit

694
00:46:14,998 --> 00:46:16,654
Do you suspect me for murder?

695
00:46:22,592 --> 00:46:24,529
See? that man?

696
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:27,037
Is that the person who came to the cinema with you to hear the show time?

697
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,826
Don't worry, he can't see us

698
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:38,701
You are rude

699
00:46:39,888 --> 00:46:43,451
If I'm innocent, do you take responsibility?

700
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:48,482
I will hold you all accountable by any means necessary.

701
00:46:48,771 --> 00:46:51,318
Please calm down,Fuji-san

702
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:54,982
You speak like a bad guy

703
00:46:55,857 --> 00:46:57,857
Your attitude is very bad

704
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:01,982
Please stop threatening me.
It will be a human rights issue

705
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:06,045
It's a favor to us that we're interviewing you here instead of at headquarters.

706
00:47:06,529 --> 00:47:07,318
Do you understand?

707
00:47:09,287 --> 00:47:11,326
Why did you lie,Fuji-san?

708
00:47:12,013 --> 00:47:14,404
You said you watched the movie from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock

709
00:47:15,404 --> 00:47:16,029
I was not lying

710
00:47:17,053 --> 00:47:17,717
I was watching

711
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:22,967
If you don't admit the lie, I'll formally get an arrest warrant.

712
00:47:23,795 --> 00:47:24,756
You can do whatever you want

713
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:25,599
Then I'll do it

714
00:47:26,826 --> 00:47:29,037
This mirror is a magic mirror

715
00:47:29,631 --> 00:47:32,779
I had the receptionist at the movie theater look at your face

716
00:47:34,029 --> 00:47:40,287
The day after the incident you went to hear the movie theater show time

717
00:47:43,178 --> 00:47:45,428
When she was killed

718
00:47:48,592 --> 00:47:49,842
I was with a person

719
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:51,037
Who is the person?

720
00:47:51,482 --> 00:47:52,435
I can't tell the name

721
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,092
If you don't say it, there is no alibi.

722
00:47:54,117 --> 00:47:55,717
Of course I didn't kill anyone

723
00:47:56,217 --> 00:47:59,193
What's wrong with Fuji chief?

724
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:01,826
Yachiyo Metal Employee Suspected of Murder

725
00:48:03,154 --> 00:48:06,928
I think the police are confident because they have reached the company

726
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:08,709
It became a big problem

727
00:48:09,521 --> 00:48:11,490
Kasumi's wife was dead?

728
00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:13,326
Yes

729
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:16,107
So He's going to marry you

730
00:48:17,537 --> 00:48:18,662
I don't think so

731
00:48:21,873 --> 00:48:23,732
You'll have to wait and see.

732
00:48:25,763 --> 00:48:27,826
Please come and visit us again to take a break

733
00:48:29,959 --> 00:48:31,646
Ah welcome

734
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:34,303
She was waiting for you

735
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,568
Please come in

736
00:48:36,435 --> 00:48:37,099
You want drink?

737
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:37,826
I don't want

738
00:48:38,529 --> 00:48:40,303
Make yourself at home.

739
00:48:43,498 --> 00:48:45,037
I thought you won't come

740
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:54,279
Did you see the newspaper

741
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,513
I didn't tell the police your name

742
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:03,951
I would be perjury if I stayed this way

743
00:49:13,763 --> 00:49:14,654
I wanted to see you

744
00:49:18,732 --> 00:49:23,310
Do the police think you have something to do with the case?

745
00:49:24,185 --> 00:49:25,092
I have no idea

746
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:30,084
I think the police will arrest me soon if they really suspect

747
00:49:36,803 --> 00:49:38,162
When you call me

748
00:49:40,513 --> 00:49:41,592
Kasumi was there

749
00:49:47,904 --> 00:49:50,623
He knows about us

750
00:49:55,013 --> 00:49:57,521
So He told our company about us

751
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:09,537
What does he think of us?

752
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:12,701
He never forgive us

753
00:50:15,701 --> 00:50:16,818
He takes revenge

754
00:50:22,248 --> 00:50:24,576
Let's run away with me

755
00:50:26,888 --> 00:50:28,756
Let's go out of his sight

756
00:50:37,506 --> 00:50:38,263
Welcome

757
00:50:38,592 --> 00:50:40,053
Mr.Miyama is waiting for you

758
00:50:40,185 --> 00:50:40,638
Mr.Miyama?

759
00:50:40,740 --> 00:50:41,053
Yes

760
00:50:45,185 --> 00:50:48,443
What's wrong?
 I was worried because you were absent without notice

761
00:50:49,763 --> 00:50:50,490
Sorry

762
00:50:54,287 --> 00:50:57,303
In fact, I'm here to say sorry

763
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,045
Sorry for the other day

764
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,482
I had a quarrel with my wife and was in a bad mood

765
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:06,053
It's not good to feel bad at home.

766
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:07,974
I don't care at all

767
00:51:08,521 --> 00:51:09,138
Please sit down

768
00:51:12,013 --> 00:51:13,162
I saw the news paper

769
00:51:14,115 --> 00:51:15,490
Yuzaki department chief worry about you

770
00:51:16,256 --> 00:51:17,232
How is the situation?

771
00:51:17,943 --> 00:51:19,006
I've had a bad experience.

772
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:21,271
I'm sorry to bother the company

773
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:26,240
The executives' feelings about that are very bad.

774
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:28,295
I'm defending you

775
00:51:29,349 --> 00:51:34,521
The impression of our company got worse because it was written in the newspaper this time.

776
00:51:35,615 --> 00:51:37,771
How about your alibi

777
00:51:40,732 --> 00:51:44,560
My alibi was recognized by the police today

778
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:47,490
That's good to hear

779
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:53,287
You should worry about yourself

780
00:51:54,568 --> 00:51:55,896
What does that mean?

781
00:51:56,818 --> 00:52:02,013
You're struggling to come up with the money.
You tried to borrow money from a woman in a bar

782
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:07,123
Kana, right?
Do you trust what she says?

783
00:52:07,193 --> 00:52:10,849
In addition, you went to see Dr. Akazsuka from time to time

784
00:52:12,263 --> 00:52:13,310
What's that all about?

785
00:52:14,545 --> 00:52:16,881
Because I was sick

786
00:52:17,787 --> 00:52:18,709
Are you sure?

787
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:23,099
She seems to have had a lot of money

788
00:52:24,381 --> 00:52:25,404
What does that mean?

789
00:52:26,053 --> 00:52:28,513
Eh? so what?

790
00:52:29,357 --> 00:52:31,420
You think too much

791
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:36,842
I will definitely find the truth

792
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:38,412
Do whatever you want

793
00:52:39,076 --> 00:52:41,990
I don't care if you threaten

794
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,568
Oh you, I wonder who is he

795
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:04,170
How long have you been working at this hospital?

796
00:53:04,412 --> 00:53:05,404
Since a week ago

797
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:08,693
How do you know I work here?

798
00:53:09,021 --> 00:53:10,896
I asked that Christian aunt

799
00:53:12,834 --> 00:53:15,631
Did you come to ask me about that incident again?

800
00:53:16,615 --> 00:53:18,834
I fed up with it

801
00:53:18,859 --> 00:53:21,842
It's not.
I don't care about her

802
00:53:22,412 --> 00:53:24,326
I'm here to ask you out

803
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,638
Wow nice

804
00:53:25,779 --> 00:53:26,474
Can you go?

805
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:29,545
I'm working until 8 o'clock tonight

806
00:53:29,841 --> 00:53:31,888
So I can play with you

807
00:53:31,935 --> 00:53:32,873
You are too good

808
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,083
I will pick you up later

809
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,826
Actually I saw many times

810
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:51,678
The wall in my room was broken and next door was the her room

811
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,170
I could see

812
00:53:53,951 --> 00:53:58,912
She kicked me out every time a man came

813
00:54:00,248 --> 00:54:02,342
You took a peek at the revenge

814
00:54:02,912 --> 00:54:04,006
You are bad girl

815
00:54:05,357 --> 00:54:06,474
Did you always see?

816
00:54:06,724 --> 00:54:08,342
Not always

817
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:10,256
I saw your sex

818
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:11,060
What?

819
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:12,084
Do you afraid?

820
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:15,623
I saw Futuya and Tokioka's sex

821
00:54:17,287 --> 00:54:18,365
Did you see Miyama's?

822
00:54:19,318 --> 00:54:21,021
Miyama-san and her are unrelated

823
00:54:23,076 --> 00:54:24,318
I don't think so

824
00:54:27,123 --> 00:54:29,826
I saw him out from her house

825
00:54:30,154 --> 00:54:32,654
Miyama-san and her are unrelated for sure

826
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:37,685
I know all.
Your face tells so

827
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:40,388
Fuji-san

828
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:41,154
What?

829
00:54:41,373 --> 00:54:42,459
Don't tell anyone

830
00:54:42,787 --> 00:54:43,303
Sure

831
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:44,662
Trust you?

832
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,482
Of course

833
00:54:46,412 --> 00:54:49,334
In fact, I saw Miyama

834
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:53,232
He was, after all, one of them.

835
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:55,912
No. he is not

836
00:54:56,342 --> 00:54:58,318
He borrowed money from her

837
00:55:11,904 --> 00:55:15,701
I was surprised and made a noise

838
00:55:17,779 --> 00:55:21,107
So you were caught peeking and you got mad.

839
00:55:21,623 --> 00:55:25,623
I was caught by them when I tried to escape

840
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:29,912
And they told me not to tell anyone.

841
00:55:30,982 --> 00:55:34,435
If I'm sued, I'll be guilty

842
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,193
It was 3 million yen in total

843
00:55:39,959 --> 00:55:43,053
Miyama gave her a receipt and documents, didn't he?

844
00:55:43,217 --> 00:55:45,810
Yes many

845
00:55:47,248 --> 00:55:48,849
I think it's a mortgage document

846
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:51,013
But it's strange

847
00:55:51,787 --> 00:55:54,576
Police have not found that document after the incident

848
00:55:55,529 --> 00:55:59,334
So Yayoi Akazuka left those documents with someone else or

849
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:03,498
Miyama stole it

850
00:56:03,646 --> 00:56:07,303
I'm scared.
Don't tell anyone I talked to you

851
00:56:08,388 --> 00:56:09,256
Do not worry

852
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:10,982
I don't tell anyone

853
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:11,670
Really?

854
00:56:13,279 --> 00:56:14,799
I don't tell anyone

855
00:56:19,256 --> 00:56:21,763
Your working condition seems to be very bad these days.

856
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:26,795
I know you're upset.
But Think a little seriously

857
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:30,029
By the way, you want to take a vacation

858
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:31,045
Yes

859
00:56:32,279 --> 00:56:33,779
I want a week off

860
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:34,967
For what?

861
00:56:37,053 --> 00:56:41,334
I'm going to find out about the incident the other day

862
00:56:42,295 --> 00:56:43,654
It's a police job

863
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:47,857
If you want to find the culprit, be the police

864
00:56:48,459 --> 00:56:51,287
If nothing is done, it will affect my credit

865
00:56:51,709 --> 00:56:52,678
Don't say bullshit

866
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:55,209
This is also the credit of the company

867
00:56:56,084 --> 00:57:00,310
The company's credibility has fallen as reported in the newspaper

868
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:02,287
You don't understand?

869
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,373
This can't be helped anymore

870
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,498
You should act carefully from now on

871
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:12,529
Yes

872
00:57:14,287 --> 00:57:15,193
I was sorry

873
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:20,271
Find out more about this article

874
00:57:20,349 --> 00:57:20,748
I see

875
00:57:20,773 --> 00:57:21,381
Thanks

876
00:57:26,756 --> 00:57:29,013
There is a call from Mr.Kasumi

877
00:57:30,068 --> 00:57:30,631
Mr.Kasumi?

878
00:57:36,342 --> 00:57:38,865
You seem to have something to do with Hisako

879
00:57:40,357 --> 00:57:41,154
No way

880
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:45,849
I want you to take out some documents from the company

881
00:57:46,365 --> 00:57:47,967
As a compensation to me

882
00:57:49,303 --> 00:57:53,068
Recently Yachiyo Metals is planning to build a new factory

883
00:57:53,873 --> 00:57:55,920
It seems that the place is also decided

884
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,287
But I don't know where

885
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,865
Yuzaki has The documents

886
00:58:08,115 --> 00:58:12,006
Get it at the shooting range at 10am the day after tomorrow

887
00:58:16,256 --> 00:58:19,193
There will be a board meeting from 10 o'clock tomorrow

888
00:58:20,232 --> 00:58:22,279
Yuzaki will be there

889
00:58:27,412 --> 00:58:31,373
If you succeed, I'll forget all about Hisako

890
00:58:34,037 --> 00:58:40,763
By the way,Do you know Mr. Miyama appeared to the police and said you were suspicious?

891
00:58:42,178 --> 00:58:42,662
Really?

892
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,920
I know a lot of information

893
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:47,513
Stop here

894
00:59:12,834 --> 00:59:13,388
Hello?

895
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:16,779
Oh...Kasumi...

896
00:59:21,787 --> 00:59:24,888
It's his trap that he approved our relationship

897
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:29,295
I won't say anything

898
00:59:32,474 --> 00:59:33,529
What are you going to do than that

899
00:59:34,146 --> 00:59:37,013
I have no choice but to obey him

900
00:59:38,279 --> 00:59:41,763
He has a meeting tomorrow, so I'll see what I can do.

901
00:59:44,232 --> 00:59:44,756
See you

902
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:15,295
Sorry I'm late

903
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,865
You work late

904
01:02:17,036 --> 01:02:18,270
I'm always skipping work so

905
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,411
Good night

906
01:02:33,068 --> 01:02:34,420
You can't find the documents?

907
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:35,756
I don't think so

908
01:02:37,013 --> 01:02:37,842
I will wait till tomorrow

909
01:02:46,467 --> 01:02:52,443
About your alibi, tell Naoko to appear at the police and testify.

910
01:02:53,818 --> 01:02:58,560
You haven't fulfilled my promise yet, but I will help you

911
01:03:00,029 --> 01:03:03,967
Anyway you bring the document or I'll do something to you

912
01:03:09,365 --> 01:03:10,967
Come here, Fuji-kun

913
01:03:14,709 --> 01:03:19,763
It's hard to say, but There was a private announcement from the personnel manager

914
01:03:20,482 --> 01:03:23,834
You're being transferred to Osaka, Mikawa-kikai.

915
01:03:24,295 --> 01:03:25,185
To Mikawa-kikai?

916
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:28,021
Of course, it has a job title

917
01:03:28,529 --> 01:03:32,506
But that is a very small company

918
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:36,146
I think I have a much better position over there.

919
01:03:36,786 --> 01:03:37,646
That's bullshit

920
01:03:37,671 --> 01:03:39,576
Listen, Fuji-kun

921
01:03:40,357 --> 01:03:46,443
The incident during this time gave a very bad impression to the company.

922
01:03:47,443 --> 01:03:48,021
You know,right?

923
01:03:48,842 --> 01:03:51,568
Yuzaki chief had no choice but to do this

924
01:03:54,404 --> 01:03:58,131
I have something to tell you in secret

925
01:04:09,756 --> 01:04:14,935
I heard you said the police suspected me and Furuya.

926
01:04:15,623 --> 01:04:16,412
What?

927
01:04:16,437 --> 01:04:17,256
Listen

928
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:23,319
I'll tell the police everything as you did to the police

929
01:04:24,779 --> 01:04:26,889
Tell the police the fact that you killed her

930
01:04:26,914 --> 01:04:29,076
Don't say bullshit

931
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:33,569
I know you borrowed 3 million yen from her

932
01:04:34,451 --> 01:04:35,889
A girl told me

933
01:04:36,561 --> 01:04:41,108
But the collateral you deposited and the loan book are nowhere to be found.

934
01:04:41,592 --> 01:04:45,975
So you killed her and robbed her of the documents

935
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:48,358
It's not true

936
01:04:50,053 --> 01:04:52,748
I tell the police everything I want to do

937
01:04:52,842 --> 01:04:53,600
Wait

938
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:56,639
It is true that I borrowed 3 million yen as you say

939
01:04:57,623 --> 01:04:58,740
But I didn't kill her

940
01:04:59,897 --> 01:05:00,756
I tell you everything

941
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:04,842
She was so black-hearted.

942
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:09,170
She demanded three times the interest she'd promised.

943
01:05:10,826 --> 01:05:13,811
I went to ask her that day

944
01:05:14,772 --> 01:05:16,061
But she was already dead

945
01:05:19,545 --> 01:05:23,412
I was surprised to take the documents and ran away

946
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:25,951
This is true.
Trust me

947
01:05:26,553 --> 01:05:28,194
I wonder the police trust you

948
01:05:29,615 --> 01:05:32,045
Even if the police believe

949
01:05:33,092 --> 01:05:34,194
It will be a problem in the company

950
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:40,662
You will be like me or you will be fired

951
01:05:41,506 --> 01:05:42,819
Because This is a criminal issue

952
01:05:46,576 --> 01:05:50,225
I don't tell anyone about it but

953
01:05:51,217 --> 01:05:54,303
Instead of it, I want you to take a document from Yuzaki chief

954
01:05:59,811 --> 01:06:01,951
Yuzaki chief is calling you,Fuji-san

955
01:06:01,976 --> 01:06:02,584
Thanks

956
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:24,061
Did you hear about your personnel changes?

957
01:06:24,264 --> 01:06:24,811
Yes

958
01:06:25,545 --> 01:06:27,490
I'm sorry to disagree with your expectations

959
01:06:28,944 --> 01:06:33,139
It was my fault.
Managing Director Domoto suddenly said at yesterday's meeting

960
01:06:33,772 --> 01:06:34,772
So I made a prompt decision

961
01:06:37,029 --> 01:06:39,037
Good luck for 3 years

962
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:41,381
Take it easy on your work.

963
01:06:42,662 --> 01:06:44,897
We need your skills

964
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:47,678
I know about you very well

965
01:06:48,561 --> 01:06:51,154
I thought I was betrayed but

966
01:06:51,975 --> 01:06:53,647
You were unlucky

967
01:06:55,608 --> 01:07:00,569
It was what anyone would do.
The question is, will it be public knowledge or not?

968
01:07:14,334 --> 01:07:15,944
Hey, there is

969
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,537
Guess where there was

970
01:07:19,076 --> 01:07:21,451
This was hidden among the documents to be disposed of.

971
01:07:23,279 --> 01:07:25,061
This is okay with your promise

972
01:07:25,086 --> 01:07:27,006
I know, let me borrow this

973
01:07:27,225 --> 01:07:28,076
What do you use?

974
01:07:28,101 --> 01:07:29,412
I'll return this tomorrow morning

975
01:07:39,147 --> 01:07:42,061
This was hidden among the documents to be disposed of,right?

976
01:07:44,826 --> 01:07:46,342
It wasn't this document?

977
01:07:46,944 --> 01:07:47,725
This is

978
01:07:48,498 --> 01:07:50,240
Give me the document case,Hisako

979
01:07:53,209 --> 01:07:57,662
If they're scrapping it, it means the project's been scrapped.

980
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:00,303
This is useless

981
01:08:03,201 --> 01:08:05,319
So..what you will do with this documents?

982
01:08:07,576 --> 01:08:08,404
Don't worry

983
01:08:09,615 --> 01:08:13,920
This is useless but You succeeded in your work

984
01:08:15,194 --> 01:08:18,225
I will forget all about her and you, as I promised.

985
01:08:28,459 --> 01:08:29,880
Planned acquisition site Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka

986
01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:31,052
Yayoi Akatsuka

987
01:08:33,912 --> 01:08:36,709
Oh yeah, Landfill of the sea in Sumiyoshi-ku, Osaka has been decided

988
01:08:37,209 --> 01:08:41,287
The price has increased 13 times due to the acquisition of it from a company in Tokyo

989
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:46,904
Hey, what's wrong?

990
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:51,342
This person is a female doctor who was killed during this time

991
01:08:51,873 --> 01:08:53,225
Oh I didn't know that

992
01:08:55,561 --> 01:08:59,139
Who is the planner for this acquisition plan?

993
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:01,318
Yuzaki, your boss

994
01:09:02,092 --> 01:09:02,647
Yuzaki...

995
01:09:03,904 --> 01:09:05,381
What is the reason for canceling this plan?

996
01:09:05,693 --> 01:09:07,428
I'm not into it

997
01:09:08,092 --> 01:09:08,498
Hey

998
01:09:13,818 --> 01:09:18,350
It seems you are into him.
Did you have any trouble with Yuzaki?

999
01:09:20,506 --> 01:09:21,545
Well..nothing

1000
01:09:22,311 --> 01:09:25,076
Do you know whose fault it is that you were moved to a rural area?

1001
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:26,022
What?

1002
01:09:27,108 --> 01:09:29,475
You misunderstand that I am involved

1003
01:09:30,186 --> 01:09:31,256
You are misguided

1004
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:32,998
The Yuzaki decided it

1005
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:36,897
Other executives didn't think so much

1006
01:09:37,608 --> 01:09:40,108
But Yuzaki pushed it

1007
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:47,115
He got in between the company and her and was taking a brokerage fee

1008
01:09:47,678 --> 01:09:52,608
But Yayoi suddenly raised the price and got into trouble

1009
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:53,686
And

1010
01:09:53,711 --> 01:09:54,842
This consultation is over

1011
01:09:55,568 --> 01:09:59,467
Originally I didn't ask your company

1012
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,404
There are many other companies they want to buy

1013
01:10:01,429 --> 01:10:03,311
But the plan was pretty much executed

1014
01:10:03,336 --> 01:10:04,701
You took 5 million yen

1015
01:10:05,647 --> 01:10:07,803
That's called embezzlement.

1016
01:10:08,897 --> 01:10:09,920
Do you threaten me?

1017
01:10:09,945 --> 01:10:13,725
What are you talking about?
You came to talk to me with that intention from the beginning

1018
01:10:14,654 --> 01:10:19,833
You slept with me and You also tried to rob the land

1019
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:23,475
Wait, how you know he slept with her?

1020
01:10:23,693 --> 01:10:25,951
No, but I'm sure

1021
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:28,123
I want the police to look it up

1022
01:10:28,148 --> 01:10:32,100
It's a personal matter.
and Akatsuka was already dead

1023
01:10:33,045 --> 01:10:37,553
I meet the president and talk about everything

1024
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:41,061
Then you will be fired, and your company make up 5 million yen for me

1025
01:10:41,443 --> 01:10:43,295
Go home now!

1026
01:10:44,584 --> 01:10:45,725
What are you doing?

1027
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,701
But is that true?

1028
01:10:49,654 --> 01:10:53,975
No matter how much it becomes a problem, I don't think he killed her

1029
01:10:54,092 --> 01:11:00,037
If she died, he should have negotiated with her aunt

1030
01:11:00,412 --> 01:11:04,326
However,he tried to issue this plan because he thought someone could find his embezzlement.

1031
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:07,045
I'm afraid this is just speculation on your part.

1032
01:11:07,178 --> 01:11:09,881
I think there is something wrong with this plan

1033
01:11:10,983 --> 01:11:13,154
Your speculation does not allow the police to investigate

1034
01:11:14,623 --> 01:11:17,178
Ok..I'm fine

1035
01:11:18,076 --> 01:11:19,428
I won't count on you

1036
01:11:24,108 --> 01:11:25,936
He's very excited

1037
01:11:27,592 --> 01:11:29,967
Because he is innocent, so he doesn’t have to do anymore

1038
01:11:32,373 --> 01:11:33,756
Yuzaki...

1039
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,842
Documents related to Yachiyo Metal

1040
01:11:49,654 --> 01:11:52,225
Inspector Tadokoro of the Akatsuka Case Investigation Headquarters, please.

1041
01:11:55,397 --> 01:11:56,834
Chief, thanks for this

1042
01:11:57,303 --> 01:11:58,787
Come here, Fuji-kun

1043
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,623
A difficult thing happened

1044
01:12:07,467 --> 01:12:10,881
It seems that your dismissal was decided at the board meeting this morning

1045
01:12:11,858 --> 01:12:12,631
I'll be fired?

1046
01:12:13,436 --> 01:12:14,709
So I don't need to go Mikawa-kikai too

1047
01:12:15,287 --> 01:12:16,006
Yes

1048
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:23,100
Where is Yuzaki Chief?

1049
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,662
He's just gone

1050
01:12:34,733 --> 01:12:35,404
Chief

1051
01:12:38,693 --> 01:12:39,326
Chief

1052
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,897
Furuya's already know I'll be fired

1053
01:12:51,936 --> 01:12:55,029
If I make a noise here I'm just miserable

1054
01:12:57,326 --> 01:12:58,404
I have to calm down

1055
01:13:06,045 --> 01:13:06,865
We are going down

1056
01:13:09,998 --> 01:13:15,045
First we have to confirm his criminal activity

1057
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:18,146
But how can I do it...

1058
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:21,545
Yuzaki...Yuzaki...

1059
01:13:22,303 --> 01:13:25,756
Oh yeah, I'll ask Yuzaki.
He is a cheif

1060
01:13:26,084 --> 01:13:28,396
He often see Dr.Akatsuka

1061
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:30,029
Yes long time ago.
4,5 times

1062
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:37,287
She suddenly quit her job a week ago

1063
01:13:38,162 --> 01:13:39,045
Where has she gone?

1064
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,357
She said she'll go home

1065
01:13:41,615 --> 01:13:42,576
But I don't know where

1066
01:13:42,732 --> 01:13:43,896
Where's her home?

1067
01:13:44,045 --> 01:13:47,107
Well..I think near Ara-liver

1068
01:13:47,264 --> 01:13:49,553
I'll check her Resume

1069
01:13:49,654 --> 01:13:50,349
Thank you

1070
01:13:59,896 --> 01:14:00,810
Hello?

1071
01:14:05,295 --> 01:14:06,412
I can't go out

1072
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:09,865
I just got call from Kasumi

1073
01:14:12,803 --> 01:14:13,529
Money?

1074
01:14:13,810 --> 01:14:15,256
Please lend me 100,000 yen as soon as possible

1075
01:14:16,342 --> 01:14:17,459
The criminal must be Yuzaki

1076
01:14:17,873 --> 01:14:19,748
I need money to find out

1077
01:14:21,326 --> 01:14:23,857
I was also fired from a company in Osaka

1078
01:14:25,076 --> 01:14:27,029
I can't just sit here and cry myself to sleep.

1079
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:34,029
by when do you need it

1080
01:14:35,951 --> 01:14:36,646
day after tomorrow?

1081
01:14:38,881 --> 01:14:39,349
Eh

1082
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:47,381
The day after tomorrow is my brother's wedding

1083
01:14:47,795 --> 01:14:48,717
What time is the day after tomorrow?

1084
01:14:49,217 --> 01:14:51,967
It's 3 o'clock but I have to get ready from the morning

1085
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:55,881
Then I'll need your help by the morning of the day after tomorrow.

1086
01:14:56,709 --> 01:14:57,568
But....

1087
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:02,756
I'll pay for it

1088
01:15:04,615 --> 01:15:06,209
I owe you 30,000yen

1089
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:07,842
30,000yen?

1090
01:15:08,248 --> 01:15:08,818
Really?

1091
01:15:08,843 --> 01:15:09,724
So please

1092
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:11,881
I'll be fine until the morning after tomorrow?

1093
01:15:11,906 --> 01:15:12,685
I promise you

1094
01:15:13,599 --> 01:15:14,693
I'll ask my mom

1095
01:15:28,467 --> 01:15:32,584
I at the time she was killed

1096
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,842
I saw Yuzaki coming out from behind the hospital

1097
01:15:38,334 --> 01:15:40,935
Oh, I didn't see him

1098
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:42,803
Don't worry.
You saw him

1099
01:15:44,912 --> 01:15:47,982
I see, so you'll give me 30,000yen

1100
01:15:52,053 --> 01:15:53,982
Then read aloud what you have written so far

1101
01:15:55,982 --> 01:16:00,599
I'm sorry to write you a letter suddenly.
Do you remember me?

1102
01:16:01,318 --> 01:16:04,256
I'm Emiko Toyama, a nurse who worked with her at the hospital

1103
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,529
Do you know why I am writing to you?

1104
01:16:09,209 --> 01:16:14,404
I saw you come out of the back of the hospital at the time she was killed

1105
01:16:15,756 --> 01:16:18,146
I've been silent about that until now

1106
01:16:18,701 --> 01:16:20,092
How do you write it?

1107
01:16:21,060 --> 01:16:21,928
write whatever you like

1108
01:16:23,678 --> 01:16:24,896
I've been silent about that until now

1109
01:16:26,115 --> 01:16:27,342
Because I hated her and

1110
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:33,732
Because I thought it didn't matter to me who killed her

1111
01:16:34,607 --> 01:16:35,873
It's hot

1112
01:16:36,224 --> 01:16:37,748
Put the fan on me.

1113
01:16:38,326 --> 01:16:40,334
However, due to some recent circumstances

1114
01:16:40,359 --> 01:16:41,881
Speak more slowly

1115
01:16:42,482 --> 01:16:44,795
However,recently

1116
01:16:45,904 --> 01:16:48,505
I suddenly needed money for some reason

1117
01:16:51,849 --> 01:16:55,545
Please prepare 1 million yen by 12:00 tomorrow

1118
01:16:55,896 --> 01:16:56,771
1 million yen?

1119
01:16:58,553 --> 01:16:59,607
Please bring it

1120
01:17:21,951 --> 01:17:24,881
Yuzaki has not left yet?

1121
01:17:25,224 --> 01:17:27,107
He is on the meeting

1122
01:17:28,271 --> 01:17:30,771
Then he has a sales meeting

1123
01:17:31,412 --> 01:17:32,490
He's been in the office for a while

1124
01:17:33,342 --> 01:17:35,553
I see.
Thank you

1125
01:17:59,482 --> 01:18:01,834
Make sure you come.
Don't bring the money

1126
01:18:01,889 --> 01:18:03,185
Yes. to Myogadani

1127
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:17,982
This is for you as we promised

1128
01:18:20,537 --> 01:18:21,279
Thanks

1129
01:18:22,795 --> 01:18:24,411
I'm sorry for the unreasonable request.

1130
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:27,295
what do you use this money for ?

1131
01:18:28,224 --> 01:18:29,021
I'll find out soon

1132
01:18:29,849 --> 01:18:32,295
I will reveal his true identity

1133
01:18:32,857 --> 01:18:34,045
So I need this money

1134
01:18:35,326 --> 01:18:39,178
You're going to catch the criminal yourself

1135
01:18:41,162 --> 01:18:42,467
You want to take a revenge?

1136
01:18:43,842 --> 01:18:44,834
Of course

1137
01:18:45,842 --> 01:18:47,568
He ruined my life

1138
01:18:48,631 --> 01:18:49,803
He is the culprit for sure

1139
01:18:50,467 --> 01:18:54,514
You're the one who knows I had nothing to do with this.

1140
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:56,381
You're the one who knows

1141
01:18:57,935 --> 01:18:59,990
Yes I know

1142
01:19:01,592 --> 01:19:03,756
But I couldn't say anything

1143
01:19:05,014 --> 01:19:05,951
Not only me

1144
01:19:07,115 --> 01:19:08,006
You too

1145
01:19:08,576 --> 01:19:10,373
You were afraid if Kazumi knows

1146
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,428
You were afraid to get rid of the company

1147
01:19:14,256 --> 01:19:17,537
But in the end nothing remained

1148
01:19:21,568 --> 01:19:24,920
When I first met you, you were so nice.

1149
01:19:25,553 --> 01:19:26,701
You were very hopeful

1150
01:19:27,678 --> 01:19:30,053
I felt so fresh.

1151
01:19:31,865 --> 01:19:36,553
I was thinking of going on a new life with you

1152
01:19:38,092 --> 01:19:41,818
I thought life with Kasumi was very miserable

1153
01:19:43,896 --> 01:19:46,092
But in the end it didn't work

1154
01:19:48,193 --> 01:19:50,959
You couldn't forget about the company after all.

1155
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:54,303
Position, promotion

1156
01:19:55,084 --> 01:19:56,459
That's all you needed

1157
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:57,881
Hisako

1158
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:59,951
Don't say anything

1159
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:04,232
You didn't choose me

1160
01:20:05,623 --> 01:20:08,545
So I couldn't leave from Kasumi

1161
01:20:12,982 --> 01:20:16,920
You couldn't understand my feelings

1162
01:20:38,006 --> 01:20:38,701
Thanks

1163
01:20:41,482 --> 01:20:43,248
I wanted more

1164
01:20:45,271 --> 01:20:46,615
578-3521

1165
01:20:47,974 --> 01:20:52,092
If Yuzaki brought me 1 million yen, how much would you give me?

1166
01:20:53,029 --> 01:20:54,021
I'll give you all

1167
01:20:54,998 --> 01:20:55,904
I'm glad

1168
01:21:08,279 --> 01:21:11,006
Hello? are you yuzaki residence?

1169
01:21:11,428 --> 01:21:13,685
Can I talk to Mr.Yuzaki?

1170
01:21:15,045 --> 01:21:16,935
Hi, it's me

1171
01:21:18,099 --> 01:21:20,084
Oh you don't remember?

1172
01:21:20,943 --> 01:21:22,764
I'm Toyama who wrote a letter to you

1173
01:21:23,803 --> 01:21:25,303
What about my request?

1174
01:21:26,576 --> 01:21:28,076
I saw you for sure

1175
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:30,818
Call me when you make a decision

1176
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:33,170
I'll wait by 6 am tomorrow

1177
01:21:34,029 --> 01:21:36,498
I'll go to police if you don't come

1178
01:21:37,537 --> 01:21:41,959
Here is my number 851-2751

1179
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:44,584
See you then

1180
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:49,803
See?
It worth 30,000yen

1181
01:21:50,881 --> 01:21:54,209
Hello?
Connect here if someone call for Toyama

1182
01:21:55,599 --> 01:21:56,420
Hey

1183
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:35,849
There is a calling

1184
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:41,178
Oh sorry. I called wrong number

1185
01:22:51,724 --> 01:22:52,654
Are you going home?

1186
01:22:53,014 --> 01:22:54,631
Because It's already past 6 o'clock

1187
01:22:54,656 --> 01:22:55,662
Please wait a little more

1188
01:22:57,060 --> 01:22:57,295
OK?

1189
01:22:57,373 --> 01:22:58,092
No

1190
01:22:58,982 --> 01:23:02,560
We don't get a call from him anymore

1191
01:23:03,271 --> 01:23:05,131
It takes time to go home

1192
01:23:05,357 --> 01:23:06,076
Please wait a little more

1193
01:23:06,771 --> 01:23:09,084
We promised that

1194
01:23:10,928 --> 01:23:12,107
Thanks for 30,000yen

1195
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,732
No! Get off of me.

1196
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:00,279
Get off of me.

1197
01:24:00,982 --> 01:24:02,102
Get off of me.

1198
01:24:13,115 --> 01:24:13,787
Wait!

1199
01:24:17,013 --> 01:24:19,076
We are arresting you for murder.

1200
01:24:22,787 --> 01:24:23,912
Stay down!

1201
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:25,912
Get off of me

1202
01:24:25,982 --> 01:24:27,022
Get off of me

1203
01:24:28,678 --> 01:24:29,615
What the hell?

1204
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,553
Come to police

1205
01:24:43,342 --> 01:24:47,482
It doesn't matter to you whether he's the culprit or not

1206
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:52,912
That's bullshit. listen,
Yuzaki tried to fire me

1207
01:24:53,318 --> 01:24:55,615
He was arrested for murder

1208
01:24:56,006 --> 01:25:00,037
And Chief Miyama has also been arrested as an embezzlement of 3 million yen.

1209
01:25:00,389 --> 01:25:02,381
I have nothing to do with the incident

1210
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,420
I am innocent

1211
01:25:04,889 --> 01:25:07,857
So the company needs to reconsider my resignation.

1212
01:25:08,514 --> 01:25:12,279
You have been deemed unfit to be our employee.

1213
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:15,053
It's needless to talk with you

1214
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,373
I speak directly with Managing Director Domoto

1215
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:18,810
Wait

1216
01:25:21,326 --> 01:25:24,678
It's waste to go.
Your return to the company was denied at the meeting.

1217
01:25:25,107 --> 01:25:27,607
What? at the meeting?

1218
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,349
An urgent meeting was held last night

1219
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,545
Your disposition also became an issue at the meeting

1220
01:25:34,740 --> 01:25:37,951
Our company does not allow your reinstatement to protect the authority of the company

1221
01:25:38,724 --> 01:25:39,920
So decided

1222
01:25:40,592 --> 01:25:43,342
This is what we have to do.

1223
01:25:43,982 --> 01:25:46,014
They don't have time to care about you

1224
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:50,107
There is a call for you,chief

1225
01:25:52,631 --> 01:25:57,576
I'm the section chief now, instead of you.

1226
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:00,170
Hello? I'm Furuya

1227
01:26:02,084 --> 01:26:05,779
It's challenging to get the job back up and running again.

1228
01:26:06,873 --> 01:26:08,146
Thanks in advance

1229
01:26:11,529 --> 01:26:13,373
We will contact you about that material within a few days.

1230
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:19,529
You've had a terrible time.

1231
01:26:20,451 --> 01:26:21,553
You were unlucky

1232
01:26:31,959 --> 01:26:32,670
Fuji-san

1233
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:36,982
It seems that Chief Miyama was arrested.

1234
01:26:37,576 --> 01:26:39,662
Our editor-in-chief wants to see you

1235
01:26:40,467 --> 01:26:43,764
He wants to know because you know the inside story of the case

1236
01:26:44,271 --> 01:26:46,560
The department chief is a murderer and the section chief is an embezzlement

1237
01:26:47,178 --> 01:26:48,420
This is interesting

1238
01:26:48,748 --> 01:26:52,107
You may be entitled to compensation from the company.

1239
01:26:53,139 --> 01:26:55,920
Please don't make such an unpleasant face

1240
01:26:56,732 --> 01:27:00,459
You are already banished from the company

1241
01:27:02,092 --> 01:27:05,396
It's all over.
This is our number

1242
01:27:06,295 --> 01:27:08,178
Our editor chief is waiting for you

1243
01:28:22,045 --> 01:28:23,435
I've left from Kasumi

1244
01:28:24,115 --> 01:28:24,514
Eh?

1245
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:31,303
I suffered a lot trying to forget you

1246
01:28:33,201 --> 01:28:34,592
But I couldn't

1247
01:28:36,482 --> 01:28:39,006
Let's get together

1248
01:28:44,404 --> 01:28:45,959
I have nothing for me anymore

1249
01:28:47,982 --> 01:28:49,881
The company didn't protect me either

1250
01:28:52,646 --> 01:28:53,646
Is that ok for you

1251
01:28:56,138 --> 01:28:56,739
Sure

1252
01:28:59,459 --> 01:29:00,803
I'll follow you

<i>Kaei / Shadow of a Flower (1961)</i>

3
00:01:32,975 --> 00:01:35,293
One Saturday in late April

4
00:01:36,066 --> 00:01:36,899
Here?

5
00:01:37,374 --> 00:01:38,882
You'd be happy.

6
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,653
Thank you very much

7
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:44,321
Hello!

8
00:01:45,316 --> 00:01:46,076
Welcome.

9
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:47,427
You look happy.

10
00:01:47,451 --> 00:01:48,710
I will also be on holiday from tomorrow

11
00:01:48,756 --> 00:01:52,118
Toku-san, is the madam still in the hospital?

12
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,309
You look great.
Oh, you're wearing an overcoat

13
00:01:53,584 --> 00:01:54,637
Kan-san

14
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,289
Are you planning to go hunting in Hokkaido?

15
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:58,237
Hey come on!

16
00:01:58,676 --> 00:01:59,878
I'm going to do Fishing

17
00:02:01,896 --> 00:02:02,784
What can I get you?

18
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:04,026
The usual one is fine.

19
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,846
Whiskey with water

20
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:05,539
What about you guys?

21
00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:06,353
 I'll have a beer

22
00:02:06,903 --> 00:02:07,690
I'll have a beer too.

23
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:09,031
Where are you taking it?

24
00:02:09,056 --> 00:02:10,333
The east coast of Izu.

25
00:02:10,358 --> 00:02:10,933
By car?

26
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,567
Right, I'll get there then

27
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:17,045
I'll set out by boat while it's still.

28
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,092
Take me there too

29
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,355
Me too, me too

30
00:02:20,399 --> 00:02:22,927
Look, there's a lot of wind outside.
You shouldn't go

31
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:24,925
What will happen if the wind blows out?

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,616
We might be on newspaper

33
00:02:26,695 --> 00:02:28,335
Two Jokyu of you were dead in the water

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,247
No way!

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,439
We are not Jokyu

36
00:02:31,869 --> 00:02:32,477
Why?

37
00:02:32,502 --> 00:02:34,079
That's so old-fashioned

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,019
What's the point?

39
00:02:36,043 --> 00:02:36,975
They don't say "hostess" anymore

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,926
So what do they say?

41
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,001
It's a hostess

42
00:02:39,632 --> 00:02:40,256
That's right, a hostess

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,706
Hostess? Looks like a self-propelled drug

44
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:48,460
There are no more Jokyu people anymore in Ginza

45
00:02:48,495 --> 00:02:51,495
But there's no one like Yo-chan here in Ginza

46
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,488
She's the last Jokyu

47
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:30,968
Hey come on.

48
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,291
If I don't catch any fish, I'll head back right away.

49
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:37,571
Welcome.

50
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,172
Don't make weird noises.

51
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:40,249
Madam

52
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:42,887
Don't call me like that.
Welcome.

53
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:43,971
Don't worry

54
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:45,091
Thanks

55
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,161
The sign outside is broken.

56
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:51,591
Ginza has great hostesses.

57
00:03:54,123 --> 00:03:56,427
Please be considerate about Toku-san when I'm not around.

58
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:58,507
I'm sorry

59
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:03,484
You sneaked out of the hospital

60
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:06,775
Who is this?

61
00:04:07,636 --> 00:04:09,496
Aya-chan introduced me to this customer

62
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:11,525
Because of him

63
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,356
Be careful not to steal our customers

64
00:04:15,712 --> 00:04:18,110
You and Yo-chan have to be really strong

65
00:04:19,095 --> 00:04:20,244
By the way, where's Yo-chan?

66
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:21,185
where's Yo-chan?

67
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:22,517
She went to drug store

68
00:04:24,322 --> 00:04:25,109
Drug store?

69
00:04:30,446 --> 00:04:31,346
Oh, Jun-chan

70
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,528
Another escape from the hospital?

71
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:38,598
What? What happened?

72
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,635
You look so beautiful tonight?

73
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:42,782
Right?

74
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:45,611
If only you could get motivated

75
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,880
I'm no good, I don't have the talent to be madam

76
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:52,591
Toku-san, give me a highball.

77
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,805
It's okay, I'll pay in cash

78
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,545
You're a little drunk

79
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:01,842
I can tell right away because you lick your lower lip

80
00:05:02,255 --> 00:05:02,875
Scotch

81
00:05:05,594 --> 00:05:07,253
What's wrong with your health

82
00:05:08,931 --> 00:05:10,158
I was going to buy some sleeping pills.

83
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:11,979
Eh?

84
00:05:15,547 --> 00:05:17,307
I can't sleep these days

85
00:05:18,872 --> 00:05:19,766
I see

86
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:24,026
When I think about this store, I can't sleep either

87
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,836
What if I close here?

88
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,234
I wonder if I should really sell here.

89
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:32,182
Oh, you owe this much to Takashima-sensei again

90
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:33,880
It can't be helped

91
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:36,905
I feel sorry for him, I can't refuse

92
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,569
You have absolutely no talent to be Madam.

93
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,035
Hello, this is Tombo

94
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:48,601
Please wait a moment

95
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,058
From hospital

96
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:51,945
Don't be loud

97
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:54,162
Please tell him I'll be back soon

98
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,006
Hello, She's back soon

99
00:05:57,669 --> 00:05:59,682
Well then, I'm counting on you

100
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:04,222
Toku-san, please do your best to collect money

101
00:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,663
I'll send her.

102
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:10,565
Okay,Don't force yourself

103
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,326
Take care of here

104
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,196
Be careful

105
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,311
Ah, She is here!

106
00:06:26,812 --> 00:06:27,832
It's been ages

107
00:06:28,157 --> 00:06:29,340
Welcome

108
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:31,293
Let's have a toast for the last Jokyu, okay?

109
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:32,969
What?

110
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh well, let's have a toast for Yo-chan.

111
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:37,589
I'll have it.

112
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,889
Let's have a toast

113
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,771
I'll go too

114
00:06:54,757 --> 00:06:56,564
This is for car fee

115
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,622
Please share this

116
00:06:57,827 --> 00:06:58,581
But...

117
00:06:58,703 --> 00:06:59,755
Don't worry.

118
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,676
Because it's a hassle

119
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:01,862
Take it

120
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:02,592
Sorry

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,225
Well, I'll give it back tomorrow

122
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,796
Oh no, tomorrow is Sunday

123
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:07,131
Oh, I see

124
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:08,118
Driver

125
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,795
Please have a safe drive.

126
00:07:11,037 --> 00:07:11,984
Trust me

127
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:13,101
Hey come on

128
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,876
Good night, good night

129
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,551
Good night

130
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,186
The letter was a suicide note addressed to his mother-in-law who lives in Mishima

131
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,259
From this moment on, the timetable for this woman's life was set

132
00:10:48,323 --> 00:10:52,894
Once dawn broke, she tidied up the things she had left behind,

133
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:57,038
sent this with the key by mail by evening,

134
00:10:57,890 --> 00:11:00,394
and then all she had to do was take the medicine

135
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:14,566
However, speaking of a timetable for life, Yoko may have thought about it a long time ago

136
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:26,428
About two years ago in an Autumn

137
00:11:51,272 --> 00:11:55,835
My child said that Tsuyuko said
she would die with my wife

138
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,290
Once you hear it, I understand.

139
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:03,490
My wife and even my kids say the same thing

140
00:12:05,713 --> 00:12:09,204
But thinking about dying and actually dying are different things

141
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,125
But Tsuyuko is 11

142
00:12:15,476 --> 00:12:21,845
She found out about  that her
mother was suffering so much that she wanted to die

143
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,800
She doesn't talk when she sees my face

144
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,441
She was the one who chased after me so much,

145
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:46,276
Close the window

146
00:12:59,837 --> 00:13:02,262
Are you suffering?

147
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:06,555
No, I'm prepared

148
00:13:07,972 --> 00:13:10,345
Even if the young lady dies?

149
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,906
she won't die

150
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:15,503
She thought she would become disabled in her legs due to polio.

151
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,686
She won't die

152
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,337
because she know it was misdiagnosis

153
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,746
As long as she doesn’t die,

154
00:13:20,777 --> 00:13:21,576
that's fine for you?

155
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:28,226
Anyway, I don't think I can stay here for a while.

156
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,373
I received my manuscript fee.

157
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,329
Here are 100,000 yen,

158
00:13:35,471 --> 00:13:36,938
but I don't need money

159
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,131
Let's break up instead

160
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:42,809
It's better,right?

161
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:46,730
No, I didn't mean to show it like that

162
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:50,362
Even if you talk about love and romance

163
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:52,675
The ending of all relationships is the same

164
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:00,643
I really was going to get married with you.

165
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,319
Even if I quit college, I could get by on my current income. That was my intention

166
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,338
But

167
00:14:10,363 --> 00:14:10,700
 it's okay,

168
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,013
you don't have to make excuses

169
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,520
But the word marriage

170
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,529
Today is the first time I've heard it from your mouth,

171
00:14:20,912 --> 00:14:22,888
we were together for 3 years though.

172
00:14:25,706 --> 00:14:28,482
I wish I'd heard those words at least sooner

173
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,756
Even if it's a lie

174
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:31,336
No

175
00:14:32,057 --> 00:14:37,067
and even when we break up, you
don't even say a word about breaking up

176
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,997
No, I'm not lying, I still have no intention of breaking up

177
00:14:43,728 --> 00:14:45,175
I want to be with you.

178
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:47,298
That's enough

179
00:14:49,518 --> 00:14:50,999
I don't need a lot of money anymore

180
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,812
I've had enough of this
enclosed life

181
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,430
But we've been together up until now,

182
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:03,775
so don't make fun of me

183
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,266
Don't even try to make fun of other people's feelings

184
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:10,006
Just go home. Whose house is this?

185
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,677
If that's your house

186
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,178
then please go home.

187
00:15:16,801 --> 00:15:17,310
Yoko,

188
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,329
Leave

189
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:25,154
I don't want to break up with you.

190
00:15:27,645 --> 00:15:29,337
Let's think about each other again

191
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:31,539
Yoko.

192
00:16:16,618 --> 00:16:17,258
Yoko.

193
00:16:18,384 --> 00:16:19,481
that's all

194
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,350
Your precious things

195
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:26,659
But how do you plan to get on with your life from now on?

196
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,759
Mishima's mother won't be worried about you

197
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:35,615
I'll be fine.

198
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,610
Ever since I was forced to quit girls' school at 15,

199
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,776
I've been living off the emptiness of Ginza

200
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,535
I'll consult with Takashima

201
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,539
Takashima-san ?

202
00:16:51,131 --> 00:16:53,160
He is a genius when it comes to Antiques

203
00:16:53,877 --> 00:16:55,024
His character is bad.

204
00:17:34,562 --> 00:17:36,168
Please take good care of your daughter

205
00:17:38,917 --> 00:17:39,377
Yap

206
00:17:40,163 --> 00:17:41,690
I won't see you off

207
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,685
Jun-chan is at the store yet?

208
00:19:07,732 --> 00:19:08,392
Not yet.

209
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:10,011
I'll stop by later

210
00:19:12,308 --> 00:19:14,725
Takashima-sensei is at the grave behind

211
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:40,238
Oh, Yoko

212
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,128
It's been a while.

213
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,406
Oh, I heard you broke up with Matsuzaki

214
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,222
He brought it up?

215
00:19:54,722 --> 00:19:55,396
No.

216
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:57,006
I told him

217
00:19:57,611 --> 00:20:00,991
I've been told by you to break up with him

218
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:04,570
That's true, but that's ridiculously sudden

219
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:05,863
Come on up

220
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:15,539
Yoko there?

221
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:23,713
Jun-chan

222
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,436
I was going to stop by later though

223
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,599
But I'm going out

224
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,772
About Matsuzaki-san?

225
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:30,538
Well, yap

226
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,802
That turned out to be a good thing.

227
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,496
Even though he's a university professor,

228
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,823
he's a person with no money

229
00:20:35,966 --> 00:20:37,756
You've been following him up until now

230
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,186
So how much did you get?

231
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,256
I can't get it

232
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,536
That person is poor

233
00:20:45,086 --> 00:20:46,948
Plus the kid is sick

234
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,793
You are stupid.

235
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:52,043
You've wasted three years of your prime

236
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:56,190
You should send him 30,000 yen every month.

237
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,255
I'm disgusted with you

238
00:20:58,283 --> 00:20:59,536
You're too kind

239
00:20:59,835 --> 00:21:01,178
It's good

240
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,166
Because she says she doesn't need it

241
00:21:03,191 --> 00:21:04,904
But....

242
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:09,311
what are you going to do from now on?

243
00:21:11,101 --> 00:21:12,781
I'm here to consult about it

244
00:21:15,439 --> 00:21:19,384
The woman who worked in Ginza have no choice but to go back to Ginza.

245
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,025
I'll have to find some place

246
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:25,995
Why not just have her come to Tombo?

247
00:21:26,047 --> 00:21:26,874
Tombo?

248
00:21:27,774 --> 00:21:30,385
Did you open another bar besides Clara?

249
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:30,991
Yap

250
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:35,259
that's why I wanted the money

251
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:38,565
That's how much preparation you need to do to work in Ginza

252
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,226
Professor Takashima,There is calling

253
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,473
You don't want to owe it out yourself,

254
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,655
Even if he says something arrogant

255
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,276
Unlike before, his wallet is empty

256
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,656
Even the antiques in this room is gone every time he come s here

257
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,680
But they are belong to him

258
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,156
But he has a brother

259
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,462
and is currently in court

260
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:08,836
Say big things like 30 million yen,

261
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,233
but you won't know until you actually hold the money

262
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,150
He hasn't paid his rent for a while.

263
00:22:14,586 --> 00:22:17,586
But I wonder if that has anything to do with the value of him?

264
00:22:18,585 --> 00:22:21,198
You are always on Takashima side

265
00:22:23,503 --> 00:22:25,457
Your ex boyfriend Matsuzaki said that too

266
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:27,938
He told Takashima didn't work

267
00:22:28,544 --> 00:22:31,077
Work is not the only measure of a person's worth.

268
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,742
Isn't it more admirable to be respected
without doing anything?

269
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,644
That's a strange logic

270
00:22:40,656 --> 00:22:43,656
Oh, I've known Matsuzaki for three years

271
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,175
I've just started to work with Takashima

272
00:22:46,527 --> 00:22:48,251
You've been friends with the teacher for almost 20 years

273
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,351
Isn't  the only one who respects Takashima is you

274
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:53,802
But, you know,

275
00:22:54,497 --> 00:23:00,102
All the customers at the bar try to hit on you when they get drunk.

276
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,256
If they give you a ride home, you won't even bother to say it

277
00:23:03,709 --> 00:23:04,904
But Professor Takashima...

278
00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:06,111
I understand that

279
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:10,124
You say he'll treat you like an ordinary amateur wife or daughter,right?

280
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,538
You are impressed he's
never had your hand held before

281
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,776
He gets involved with other girls

282
00:23:16,806 --> 00:23:18,104
It's different for me.

283
00:23:18,847 --> 00:23:21,639
I've acted a little selfish

284
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,452
but the teacher's attitude hasn't changed

285
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,907
For me, it's enough that he's alive.

286
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:30,655
I guess that's what happens when you're born a
beautiful woman like you and pampered by a man

287
00:23:31,981 --> 00:23:32,696
I get it

288
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,691
Well, I'll talk to him

289
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,228
Rich people are stingy

290
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:40,430
There's a lot of fuss about buying a 2.3 million's pipe

291
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:43,089
Oyo, what happened?

292
00:23:43,629 --> 00:23:46,339
I've decided to help out at Jun-chan's store after all

293
00:23:46,443 --> 00:23:48,229
I've left it to a girl named Ayako

294
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,616
Let's have some madam for Io-chan too

295
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,073
That doesn't matter

296
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,166
If I can work comfortably,

297
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,358
it's no good

298
00:23:55,383 --> 00:23:57,385
It's a battle to be won in the first month of opening

299
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:59,288
How much do you pay her?

300
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,456
We can talk about it later

301
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,682
Oh It's time

302
00:24:06,109 --> 00:24:08,645
I have to go to the store early today to see the new girl

303
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:10,856
Can you get me some money?

304
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,978
5000 yen is fine

305
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:13,329
5000 yen?

306
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:15,685
Well, I wouldn't say that's impossible

307
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,001
He paid on credit a lot.

308
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,417
Teacher?

309
00:24:28,021 --> 00:24:29,163
I have a little bit,

310
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:31,196
but I can't borrow it from you.

311
00:24:31,365 --> 00:24:32,496
It's okay.

312
00:24:33,452 --> 00:24:36,438
Instead, Treat me tonight

313
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:46,175
I'm surprised you're motivated to work again

314
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,006
You hate bars

315
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:49,121
but I can't help it

316
00:24:49,942 --> 00:24:52,302
I have to believe I can die whenever I want

317
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,838
I can't go out to Ginza when I'm like this

318
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:57,465
You are still beautiful

319
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:02,780
It's been my childhood dream
to die before I get old

320
00:25:03,873 --> 00:25:05,799
I don't mind dying anytime now

321
00:25:05,996 --> 00:25:07,592
I want to die too

322
00:25:08,163 --> 00:25:11,580
Why you have to die?

323
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,540
It's good to teach good antiques to people

324
00:25:15,739 --> 00:25:17,325
What's the point of teaching them?

325
00:25:17,769 --> 00:25:19,391
People don't do what I tell them to do,

326
00:25:19,636 --> 00:25:21,408
so who cares?

327
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:24,694
I'll be satisfied
if I can die doing what I want

328
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:28,550
Humans can never be satisfied with their own lives

329
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,966
So it's okay to die anytime

330
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:36,326
Ah, if you are going to die, I don't mind dying too

331
00:25:37,272 --> 00:25:41,275
Yes, then let's die together

332
00:25:44,088 --> 00:25:47,088
I'll work hard for you, teacher

333
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,950
Take care.

334
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:25,105
Madam, there is a call

335
00:26:29,128 --> 00:26:30,183
Thank you

336
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,406
Kulara's Madam

337
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,646
Isn't she  being greedy again?

338
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,293
Yes, it's Ayako

339
00:26:40,584 --> 00:26:44,010
It's been less than a month
since we opened, right?

340
00:26:46,226 --> 00:26:47,627
Should I ask Yoko?

341
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:48,846
From Jun-chan?

342
00:26:50,259 --> 00:26:52,565
Yes, I understand that very well

343
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:53,792
Thank you very much.

344
00:26:57,065 --> 00:26:57,658
Yap

345
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,690
Wow, you're so strong

346
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:03,716
She's always been unable to talk
in front of customers unless she drink

347
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:06,296
I sometimes forget that I'm an old lady

348
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,283
and I'm performing in front of customers

349
00:27:08,486 --> 00:27:09,752
Don't be humble

350
00:27:09,777 --> 00:27:12,026
When you are at the store,

351
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,336
I told you to be considerate of Kimono in this pattern color, right?

352
00:27:14,376 --> 00:27:15,236
Sorry

353
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:18,393
Shimizu-san, welcome back.

354
00:27:18,705 --> 00:27:20,036
You were too late

355
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,616
Give me the bag

356
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,526
Are you going home already?

357
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,066
I have a script meeting with Daita

358
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:27,236
The video shoot is coming up

359
00:27:27,836 --> 00:27:29,385
I'm totally busy

360
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,846
Well then, goodbye,Yo-chan.

361
00:27:32,572 --> 00:27:34,190
Thank you very much

362
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:38,204
You acted like you were Madam

363
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:40,549
She has a husband in Osaka,

364
00:27:40,582 --> 00:27:42,635
but she's cheating on him with Shimizu

365
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:44,487
That's good

366
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:50,010
Oh Yoko-san, what's that nice Kimono

367
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:51,159
You think so?

368
00:27:51,494 --> 00:27:53,838
Oh Toku-san, make Yoko-san another highball

369
00:27:55,736 --> 00:27:56,627
Don't worry.

370
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,744
Kulara's madam won't know anyway

371
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,346
Oh, Hata-san, are you going home already?

372
00:28:02,371 --> 00:28:03,869
Well....

373
00:28:11,525 --> 00:28:14,525
Toku-san here, Prepare any wet towels ready

374
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:16,080
Yoko

375
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,166
Hata-san again....

376
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,436
Again?

377
00:28:20,244 --> 00:28:21,870
He really wants to get married now

378
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:24,533
Anyway, seriously

379
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,299
If only you were okay

380
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,744
so please go to the table

381
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,682
Yes, please,

382
00:28:38,707 --> 00:28:40,080
Thank you.

383
00:28:43,436 --> 00:28:45,713
Ayako, weren't you treating me like a fish?

384
00:28:46,198 --> 00:28:47,042
No way

385
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:49,330
Would you like something to drink?

386
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:51,276
Yes, I'll have some

387
00:28:51,506 --> 00:28:52,791
You go and order something.

388
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,016
I wanted to have a long talk with you

389
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,876
The highball that Yoko drank

390
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,026
Put it on Hata-san's bill

391
00:29:10,051 --> 00:29:10,817
I get it.

392
00:29:12,128 --> 00:29:16,690
Now I am a lawyer and works as a legal advisor for a large company

393
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,416
I was originally born into a fisherman's family in Chiba

394
00:29:19,751 --> 00:29:23,486
My dad sold his last fishing boat to send me to college

395
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:29,424
You're with your daughter?

396
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,549
Who told you that?

397
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,166
But that child isn't mine

398
00:29:34,831 --> 00:29:36,393
She's the stepchild of the deceased dorm member

399
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:38,463
Oh really?

400
00:29:39,651 --> 00:29:40,698
That's hard, isn't it?

401
00:29:40,978 --> 00:29:41,869
What's the problem?

402
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:44,822
Raising a child on your own as a man?

403
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:46,533
I've got to ask
my grandmother to come over

404
00:29:47,974 --> 00:29:51,651
I think your child feels lonely when you come home late every night.

405
00:29:52,042 --> 00:29:54,103
Do you want me to come home early?

406
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,986
That's not true

407
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,143
I'll go home if you're with me,

408
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:02,940
No, I'm at work

409
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,494
No, I told Ayako

410
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,643
Should I tell Junko?

411
00:30:07,127 --> 00:30:08,721
Okay, let's call Kulara

412
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,385
Don’t do that.

413
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,119
Better yet, go home earlier today

414
00:30:20,029 --> 00:30:21,415
Oh, what's wrong?

415
00:30:21,658 --> 00:30:25,361
You're just saying nice things and nothing is getting through

416
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,447
I'm serious

417
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,896
Give me my bag.

418
00:30:28,921 --> 00:30:30,182
I'm leaving

419
00:30:30,207 --> 00:30:32,408
Please wait for me

420
00:30:32,643 --> 00:30:33,839
Hata.

421
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:42,276
I'm glad you came

422
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,299
Come on in, come on in.

423
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:50,678
It's a big house,

424
00:30:50,702 --> 00:30:52,252
but we're only renting the second floor

425
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,104
But it was really nice of you to come

426
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,006
Come in.

427
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:00,354
it's not you, I came to see your daughter

428
00:31:00,793 --> 00:31:01,557
Oh my god.

429
00:31:01,996 --> 00:31:03,486
But It's enough that you came

430
00:31:03,666 --> 00:31:07,354
It's true, I was adopted too

431
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,002
That's why I wanted to meet your daughter

432
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:11,533
Oh, I see

433
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,446
Is she out?

434
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,354
She's here.

435
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,700
The weather is nice today but I'm not taking her anywhere so she's very upset.

436
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,533
Matsuko

437
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,924
Yes

438
00:31:23,862 --> 00:31:24,487
She's Yoko

439
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,676
Say hello

440
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,577
Welcome

441
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:28,885
You are called Matsuko-san, right?

442
00:31:29,065 --> 00:31:29,690
Yes.

443
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:32,502
That's a nice name.

444
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:35,745
Is Matsu a pine tree?

445
00:31:35,948 --> 00:31:36,503
Yes

446
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,861
Really? I'm Yoko the Leaf Yoko

447
00:31:42,771 --> 00:31:46,501
I work at a place where you and your dad drink.

448
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,979
I know

449
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:53,447
Oh, Dad says anything to Matsuko-chan

450
00:31:54,087 --> 00:31:57,690
That's because there's only one parent
and one child, so I know everything

451
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,526
You guys looks alike

452
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:04,831
You think so?

453
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,111
It's not like we're related by blood, though

454
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,783
What an idiot.

455
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,354
What's wrong?

456
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,940
You shouldn't say something like that
in front of a child

457
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:47,322
Matsuko-chan, why don't
you go out and play somewhere with me?

458
00:32:49,965 --> 00:32:51,501
You wanted to go somewhere today, right?

459
00:32:57,416 --> 00:33:00,416
An amusement park? Or a movie?

460
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,886
Let's leave Dad alone

461
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,518
and go just the two of us, right?

462
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:10,339
Let's do that

463
00:33:13,621 --> 00:33:15,986
What's wrong? Do you not want to?

464
00:33:17,106 --> 00:33:19,330
You came to see my mother, didn't you?

465
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:27,237
Yo-chan

466
00:33:27,621 --> 00:33:28,471
Wait up

467
00:33:33,057 --> 00:33:34,276
You left something behind

468
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,127
You don't have to follow me.

469
00:33:37,339 --> 00:33:38,443
I know the way

470
00:33:39,173 --> 00:33:40,308
Don't be mad

471
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:43,088
Matsuko is like that sometimes.
I'll scold her

472
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:45,174
She has no reason to be scold

473
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,205
It's not your fault at all. All that talk about blood ties

474
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,416
Yo-chan

475
00:33:52,250 --> 00:33:54,456
If you care about Matsuko that much,

476
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,658
will you marry me?

477
00:33:57,762 --> 00:33:58,861
That's very old fashioned

478
00:33:58,886 --> 00:34:00,128
Don't take advantage of children

479
00:34:00,339 --> 00:34:00,964
Yo-chan

480
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,854
That's how you cheat women.

481
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:12,432
but Yoko-san is a little clever, so don't underestimate me,marriage fraud.

482
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,729
What?

483
00:34:16,817 --> 00:34:17,944
So it's OK without marriage?

484
00:34:19,441 --> 00:34:21,293
Look,the truth is out

485
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:24,161
You are about to let the hostess into your home.

486
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,438
and gave it to you for cheap

487
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,192
Let's go home,

488
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,876
Wait a minute

489
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,798
That was a joke

490
00:34:35,789 --> 00:34:40,465
please marry me. My kid is grown up and you can work at bar

491
00:34:41,808 --> 00:34:43,676
I'm in love with you

492
00:34:46,009 --> 00:34:47,945
I am a country bumpkin and not very manly

493
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,051
But I'm really in love with you

494
00:34:49,076 --> 00:34:50,567
Someone has come along.

495
00:35:03,637 --> 00:35:06,598
Please marry me

496
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,247
Please

497
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:11,817
It's an overstatement.

498
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,676
Don’t do that.

499
00:35:18,637 --> 00:35:21,637
No matter how much you rub your head against the tatami mat

500
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,809
or shed tears, in the end

501
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,481
Only men benefit

502
00:35:27,941 --> 00:35:29,317
Only women get hurt

503
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,419
I'm not a woman worth that much

504
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,458
You don't have to decide
if it's worth it or not

505
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,906
Please reply me.

506
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:38,567
No way,it's too soon.

507
00:35:38,755 --> 00:35:39,755
Please reply tomorrow at the store.

508
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,415
Well, I can't accept

509
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,434
Anyway, I'm going tomorrow

510
00:35:42,949 --> 00:35:47,348
As you say like that, I guess she didn't feel too bad about it?

511
00:35:47,811 --> 00:35:48,747
Why?

512
00:35:50,145 --> 00:35:52,075
What did he look like?

513
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,231
I can roughly guess

514
00:35:54,552 --> 00:35:56,176
He won't make her a woman

515
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,770
But I don't think it's a bad thing

516
00:35:59,052 --> 00:35:59,677
Reach

517
00:35:59,794 --> 00:36:01,965
Oh lucky again

518
00:36:02,387 --> 00:36:05,973
I agree too. Even in mahjong, if you miss your chance,

519
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,059
it's hard to make up for it

520
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,645
Plus, that person has connections in big companies

521
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,575
and is important to the store

522
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,746
It would be helpful if you could marry him

523
00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:17,700
Because he has a cheeky daughter

524
00:36:17,962 --> 00:36:22,286
There's no ideal marriage arrangement like that.
Don't care the daughter.

525
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:26,028
What do you think, teacher?

526
00:36:26,537 --> 00:36:27,402
What do I think?

527
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,676
It's not like I'm going to get married

528
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,340
That was it

529
00:36:31,513 --> 00:36:32,896
I'm up.

530
00:36:33,484 --> 00:36:35,606
Stop it, it's dirty way.

531
00:36:37,435 --> 00:36:38,848
Sorry

532
00:36:38,873 --> 00:36:40,802
I'm unlucky today.

533
00:36:41,891 --> 00:36:44,891
Today I got drunk and talked a lot

534
00:36:45,473 --> 00:36:46,395
I feel like drinking whiskey

535
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,754
No Half-drunk whiskey

536
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,616
If you met Hata-san,

537
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,656
you should have brought back some bills

538
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,770
I'll buy them for you

539
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,067
Give this to me

540
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,436
No, it's 5000 yen at the department store

541
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,200
Please pay the cost price

542
00:36:59,294 --> 00:36:59,864
Please

543
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:01,224
Don't worry.

544
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,661
Because I'm going to drink too

545
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,559
Yoko, it's fine to drink, but if you do it while drinking, it's bad.

546
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:18,970
That's dangerous, let me take you home in my car

547
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,997
I'm going to the studio for rehearsals anyway

548
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:22,590
Thank you

549
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:28,247
it feels good to be treated so
kindly by another girl's boyfriend

550
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,325
Are you talking about Aya-chan?

551
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,692
She is aiming for something bigger

552
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,826
I know this is unnecessary,

553
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:36,450
but be careful of Hata-san.

554
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,333
Come on, Yo-chan,

555
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,146
I'm sorry

556
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,416
It's okay now, I'm used to coming home drunk

557
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,770
Maybe we should have some tea?

558
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:20,012
I did, but then the rehearsal started again

559
00:38:45,318 --> 00:38:45,926
Hata-san

560
00:38:48,207 --> 00:38:49,825
You're probably thinking
I'm being too persistent

561
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:52,208
I just couldn't stay still like that

562
00:38:55,486 --> 00:38:57,661
I won't get a response until tomorrow night

563
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,348
I don't like this place,
take me somewhere else,

564
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,106
You were sleeping comfortably

565
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,794
Go to take another bath

566
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:40,040
What's wrong?

567
00:39:41,125 --> 00:39:41,801
What time is it now?

568
00:39:43,742 --> 00:39:44,555
It's a little after 11 o'clock

569
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:47,278
There don't seem to be many customers tonight,

570
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:48,909
so I think you can sleep in

571
00:39:48,934 --> 00:39:50,208
I'm going home,

572
00:39:50,687 --> 00:39:51,853
what's the matter?

573
00:39:51,878 --> 00:39:53,149
Let me do that

574
00:39:56,337 --> 00:39:59,442
I'll give you my marriage proposal tomorrow.

575
00:40:24,294 --> 00:40:26,637
Who is it? Hata-san?

576
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:28,270
Oyo, it's me

577
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:33,653
What's wrong, teacher? Teacher,
you're not even wearing a scarf.

578
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:35,265
It's gotten cold

579
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:36,614
Oh, let me have one

580
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:39,426
I got robbed at mahjong yesterday

581
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,028
I barely made it this far

582
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,596
Did you lose that much?

583
00:40:42,621 --> 00:40:43,403
5,000 yen

584
00:40:43,521 --> 00:40:45,130
I even left a debt

585
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:48,240
Are you hungry?

586
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:49,800
your stomach is fine,

587
00:40:49,825 --> 00:40:51,270
but please give me back some delicious pickles

588
00:40:54,966 --> 00:40:56,153
Didn't you go to work today?

589
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:59,482
No, I went to Mishima to relax

590
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:03,309
Didn't your mom say something
terrible again?

591
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,756
Talking about marriage

592
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,137
You were pretty serious yesterday,

593
00:41:08,464 --> 00:41:10,926
She's not my confidant.

594
00:41:13,009 --> 00:41:16,442
I regret not telling you it was yesterday

595
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,762
But in the end,
don't you want to get married?

596
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:24,262
Does that seem like how I see it?

597
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:27,833
Oh, I'm sorry

598
00:41:41,657 --> 00:41:44,926
Oyo, don't deceive yourself

599
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,356
Well, I don't want to marry you, but

600
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,470
Hata-san doesn't seem like as bad a person as people say,

601
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:59,825
but I just can't make up my mind

602
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,312
You are confused

603
00:42:02,317 --> 00:42:03,567
To be honest

604
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,645
Well then, I have something to say

605
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:08,192
What?

606
00:42:08,968 --> 00:42:12,684
I think marriage is bad for you.

607
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,286
Not just Hata

608
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:19,345
In other words, how should I put it? In short,

609
00:42:19,385 --> 00:42:23,747
I don't think you'll be happy if you get married.

610
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,778
It seems that's the case

611
00:42:27,215 --> 00:42:29,426
Marriage is a kind of deal.

612
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,520
Whether it's money or love, you only get along if you have each other's long asses

613
00:42:35,121 --> 00:42:38,856
You have no experience doing that

614
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:42,935
Many men have fallen in love with you

615
00:42:44,384 --> 00:42:48,450
but no matter what, you always give it back twice or three times as much

616
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:51,458
That's why it doesn't matter

617
00:42:54,945 --> 00:42:55,720
Yes, thank you

618
00:42:57,044 --> 00:42:59,435
This is very delicious.

619
00:43:00,263 --> 00:43:01,208
oh, you're right

620
00:43:03,014 --> 00:43:04,090
I'm stupid

621
00:43:04,427 --> 00:43:06,778
no, you're too good for a woman

622
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,575
Matsuzaki once told me that too

623
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:13,256
In the end, I'm a villain

624
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,114
But there is such a thing

625
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:21,810
Well, if he loves you, then I don't care what happens

626
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,286
I just wish you'd stopped getting married

627
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,481
It's sad though

628
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,528
Well, there's no rule that every woman has
to have a husband.

629
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,200
It's more comfortable being alone

630
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:38,091
It could be.

631
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:41,348
Yeah, I was also muttering after breaking up with Matsuzaki.

632
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:43,482
You shouldn't act tough anymore

633
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,809
It will snap completely

634
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:51,708
It's safer if you stay low and creeps along the ground

635
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,476
So you're saying to keep a low profile

636
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:55,696
Oh, you're smart

637
00:44:01,715 --> 00:44:03,634
But it's strange

638
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,169
When I was talking to the teacher,

639
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:07,536
I felt a lot of things building up inside me

640
00:44:08,802 --> 00:44:13,020
It always feels like the lump is gone all at once

641
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:14,669
Oh, I see.

642
00:44:15,539 --> 00:44:16,873
I've already eaten.

643
00:44:18,388 --> 00:44:19,372
Eat some ochazuke

644
00:44:19,511 --> 00:44:20,575
I'm going home now.

645
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:22,317
Oh, you just got here

646
00:44:22,889 --> 00:44:24,614
That's all I have left of my life.

647
00:44:25,271 --> 00:44:27,552
Why don't you stay? The wind is blowing.

648
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,857
Thank you for the meal

649
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:29,926
I'll come again

650
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:34,583
Oh, right? You don't have any money,do you? Yes,

651
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:41,465
I have 3,000 yen

652
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,756
Take it with you

653
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,028
So, shall I borrow it?

654
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:46,981
Junko gets mad when I get into debt

655
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:48,395
Ah, teacher

656
00:45:04,138 --> 00:45:05,271
Be careful.

657
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,403
Is it okay here? It's cold,

658
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:18,465
so please pick it up quickly

659
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:20,973
Please give me some extra film too.

660
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,372
Don't show this to Hata

661
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:25,086
Another one

662
00:45:25,110 --> 00:45:25,965
Squat there

663
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:29,232
I can't see you much these days,

664
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,645
but maybe you're not letting me in?

665
00:45:30,899 --> 00:45:33,505
Do you not want your boyfriend to spend money?

666
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:35,190
Don't be cheeky.

667
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:36,473
Boy?

668
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,239
Stand up.

669
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:41,622
Your dad pays the bill for this bar.

670
00:45:42,177 --> 00:45:43,676
You are still child

671
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,208
Oh my god.

672
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:49,450
When you say that, what's so funny about men coming to bars?

673
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,119
Probably no one will come for fun

674
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:55,416
I don't think there are any girls who enjoy working there

675
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:56,895
It's a strange place,

676
00:45:58,097 --> 00:45:59,531
Definitely

677
00:46:00,330 --> 00:46:01,614
In other words....

678
00:46:01,639 --> 00:46:02,864
Give it to me

679
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:03,825
Be careful.

680
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:10,786
In other words, the anxiety.....someone with no talent like me can't do a job like directing a TV show

681
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,516
And I am constantly being chased by time

682
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,551
It becomes like a kind of neurosis

683
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,056
Confidence is gone and anxiety is building

684
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,646
That's when I need to come to the bar

685
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:21,966
By your Dad's money

686
00:46:21,990 --> 00:46:23,567
You say it again.

687
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:25,645
Hey you, let's take a photo

688
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,145
Oh yeah, your dad was a TV executive

689
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,028
Stop it about saying my dad.

690
00:46:33,678 --> 00:46:36,090
Hey, Professor Takashima

691
00:46:37,489 --> 00:46:40,095
please put him on an educational TV show or something?

692
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:41,776
If that's the case,

693
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,419
I don't have to tell my dad, I'll talk to the programming director myself.

694
00:46:44,444 --> 00:46:45,130
Come in.

695
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:46,911
Excuse me.

696
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:48,559
but can you go ahead for a bit?

697
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:51,927
Yo-chan.

698
00:46:51,959 --> 00:46:53,169
Can't you see Hata-san?

699
00:46:53,194 --> 00:46:53,794
No

700
00:46:53,974 --> 00:46:54,755
oh, that's right.

701
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,976
I just came downstairs with a customer so I stopped by

702
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:58,756
About his bill?

703
00:46:59,684 --> 00:47:03,020
sorry, I haven't forgotten, but how much was it?

704
00:47:03,208 --> 00:47:04,005
Sorry.

705
00:47:04,872 --> 00:47:07,778
Well, it's not right to ask you to do that

706
00:47:07,990 --> 00:47:10,458
Anyway, his bill has already accumulated

707
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:12,886
Come inside and wait for a bit

708
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:14,032
Oh, I see.

709
00:47:14,445 --> 00:47:16,299
Toku-san

710
00:47:22,497 --> 00:47:24,364
I'm short on 2000 yen. Can you lend me
some?

711
00:47:24,935 --> 00:47:26,739
Yo-chan, it's time to stop messing around

712
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:30,677
There's no need to pay Mr. Hata's bill.

713
00:47:31,078 --> 00:47:34,762
Because I got him to buy Christmas tickets

714
00:47:36,809 --> 00:47:40,165
It looks you are giving me 10,000 yen in change for a 1,000 yen bill

715
00:47:43,396 --> 00:47:44,817
Sorry.

716
00:47:55,656 --> 00:47:57,270
Good evening.

717
00:47:57,638 --> 00:47:58,771
Aya-chan is off?

718
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:00,716
Hey Yo-chan. I need to talk with you.

719
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,090
What's wrong? You've got a scary look on your face.

720
00:48:11,717 --> 00:48:14,717
I'm so angry.
Can't you be the only one who's okay?

721
00:48:15,951 --> 00:48:17,605
I'm so frustrated,

722
00:48:17,727 --> 00:48:18,754
so what's wrong?

723
00:48:19,153 --> 00:48:20,975
Look,
it's Clara on 7th Street

724
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,536
There was a place that was trying to replace that.

725
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,097
In the basement of a building in Higashi Ginza

726
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,777
That spot got stolen away from me.

727
00:48:29,801 --> 00:48:32,535
Guess who it was? It was Ayako.

728
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:37,941
She used me to get that spot.

729
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,105
And moreover

730
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:47,683
It was Hata who gave the push
and brought the matter together

731
00:48:49,309 --> 00:48:50,129
Hata?

732
00:48:51,847 --> 00:48:59,060
Didn't you know? I thought Ayako had a lot of days off recently, and it turns out they went to Osaka together,

733
00:48:59,085 --> 00:49:00,900
to prepare the money for that.

734
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:03,439
Ayako is Ayako,

735
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,267
and Hata is Hata, right?

736
00:49:05,628 --> 00:49:08,142
He pretended to marry you.

737
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:10,501
You were trying to pay his bills,right?

738
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,157
I'm totally shocked
and don't like it

739
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:16,890
Yoko, Hata is here

740
00:49:21,142 --> 00:49:22,275
Kumi-chan

741
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:25,103
 what's wrong with you?

742
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:27,275
You know what?

743
00:49:28,416 --> 00:49:29,924
What's wrong?

744
00:49:44,299 --> 00:49:45,385
It's been ages.

745
00:49:45,642 --> 00:49:46,895
How are you?

746
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,306
Yes, thanks to you,

747
00:49:49,330 --> 00:49:50,345
that's good

748
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:52,572
It's so cold

749
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,275
You are prone to catching colds

750
00:50:01,509 --> 00:50:04,007
Oh, by the way, Matsuko wants to meet you

751
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,346
Look, that big doll

752
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:07,776
you gave her for Christmas

753
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,931
She still sleep with it by her pillow.

754
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:16,314
I've also been in a bit of trouble lately with the Kanto Electric Railway's land acquisition

755
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,056
After all, it's a government job

756
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,636
I'm very busy

757
00:50:20,661 --> 00:50:26,838
Oh yeah, I thought you were busy buying up bars in Higashi Ginza again

758
00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:28,076
What?

759
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:34,010
How did you like Osaka?

760
00:50:34,611 --> 00:50:36,220
You felt like a newlywed couple?

761
00:50:38,634 --> 00:50:40,362
Yes, I guess you're serious this time

762
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,384
The other person is a young person

763
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,314
What are you talking about?

764
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:46,134
Because you're a great person too

765
00:50:46,431 --> 00:50:49,430
It's about time to pretend to slam your head on the tatami mat.

766
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,846
What's wrong with this girl?

767
00:50:53,734 --> 00:50:56,202
You should stop trying to get a hold of the hostess' money.

768
00:50:58,546 --> 00:50:59,827
Stop it

769
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:04,109
Stay strong.

770
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,047
Are you alright?

771
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,327
You're a crybaby

772
00:51:27,844 --> 00:51:29,422
I'm not going to cry

773
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,554
I've been in Hostess of Ginza for over ten years

774
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:36,890
I have had many experiences like this.

775
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,851
It's mostly because Yo-chan was spoiled too much

776
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,359
I warned her

777
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:45,601
but I an really that stupid

778
00:51:46,308 --> 00:51:47,820
Remember that

779
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:51,350
Yes, yes, I want to be stupid too,

780
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:53,749
but it seems like my turn never comes

781
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:58,898
You're cheeky.

782
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:41,346
I don't care if anyone knows.

783
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:44,350
Even Takashima-sensei?

784
00:52:45,366 --> 00:52:46,405
It can't be helped.

785
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:05,827
Come on, you idiot, it's already noon and you have a book reading at 1 o'clock,right?

786
00:53:07,731 --> 00:53:09,390
Oh wait a minute?

787
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:13,466
I'm so happy
they finally changed it

788
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:16,490
This is the first time someone has asked me to change my hair style

789
00:53:16,515 --> 00:53:18,476
Yeah, it's absolutely wonderful

790
00:53:21,734 --> 00:53:23,560
I think you should put out a bit more here

791
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:26,226
You're too noisy

792
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:27,456
Even in actresses' hair

793
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,766
I often claim

794
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,741
Now I'm ready,

795
00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:43,230
You are sleeping again.

796
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:47,030
You see, the smell of you still lingers

797
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:48,656
You idiot.

798
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:51,789
Are you there?

799
00:53:52,781 --> 00:53:53,828
It's Takashima Sensei

800
00:54:06,757 --> 00:54:08,038
Excuse me.

801
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:09,594
Don't worry.

802
00:54:10,050 --> 00:54:12,106
I was thinking of going to visit Junko

803
00:54:12,130 --> 00:54:13,179
I came to invite you

804
00:54:15,383 --> 00:54:16,206
Excuse me.

805
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:17,390
You're welcome

806
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,023
You changed your hair

807
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:25,413
I wonder if that's Shimizu's hobby

808
00:54:26,455 --> 00:54:27,773
What about dinner, Sensei?

809
00:54:27,798 --> 00:54:28,902
It's lunchtime.

810
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:32,390
Please try the eel bowl.
I've only made enough for two people

811
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,710
This is the real "thank you for the meal" thing.

812
00:54:35,922 --> 00:54:37,015
I'll call then

813
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,085
Please have some tea.

814
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:49,344
Is this yours? Oh,

815
00:54:49,593 --> 00:54:50,406
Yo-chan's

816
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,406
but do you have about 5,000 yen with you? Oh,

817
00:54:55,479 --> 00:54:56,929
if you have that much

818
00:54:59,484 --> 00:55:03,281
there's a shop called Nihon
Hobby Store at the Yaesu exit that caters to tourists

819
00:55:03,866 --> 00:55:08,210
I can pay you back right away once I've decided a deal about the Muromachi pottery

820
00:55:08,410 --> 00:55:09,351
Anytime is fine.

821
00:55:10,366 --> 00:55:11,734
Don't tell Oyo about it

822
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,386
Surely you were single

823
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:22,914
Yes.

824
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:27,445
Oyo still has the heart of a child

825
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,116
That's how I like her

826
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:34,734
There's something so sweet
about her little expressions and gestures

827
00:55:35,218 --> 00:55:38,218
Are you going to marry her?

828
00:55:39,453 --> 00:55:41,594
No, no, I haven't decided yet

829
00:55:43,787 --> 00:55:46,787
She seems to have given up on marriage.

830
00:55:47,447 --> 00:55:49,748
But it seems like she wants a little

831
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,150
Please think about that for a moment.

832
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:55,991
Ah, it's cold.

833
00:56:07,054 --> 00:56:08,234
Are you surprised?

834
00:56:09,142 --> 00:56:11,335
I've been dyeing it secretly up until now

835
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,499
I'm scared to look in the mirror every day

836
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,171
It's not that bad

837
00:56:19,229 --> 00:56:21,187
If you just stay still, you'll get better soon

838
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:22,297
No...

839
00:56:23,430 --> 00:56:25,491
I knew this would happen someday

840
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:29,241
If it wasn't lung disease, I'd be cancer

841
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:33,080
But you're not worried about money

842
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:34,179
That's good

843
00:56:35,023 --> 00:56:36,250
That's not true

844
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,970
It's okay though, because I sold Clara on 7th Street

845
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,820
As for Tombo, you and Toku are the only ones I can rely on,

846
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,826
so please do your best

847
00:56:46,092 --> 00:56:47,374
You're getting greedy again

848
00:56:48,054 --> 00:56:50,695
money, money, this is your punishment for making so much money

849
00:56:55,116 --> 00:56:57,452
What would happen if I became like this?

850
00:56:59,033 --> 00:57:02,033
So, you should save money or get married

851
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,702
I'm saying you have to choose one or the other

852
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:08,546
It's about time for you too

853
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,240
If Shimizu-san could marry you

854
00:57:13,981 --> 00:57:15,027
As for Hata

855
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:18,160
If you had felt that way, you would have gotten together

856
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:21,104
Hey, hey, you may know a lot about money,

857
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,738
but what about getting marriage?

858
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:24,129
Stop complaining

859
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,886
That's right, I have something to talk to Yo-chan about

860
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:29,941
Can you please leave your seat for a moment?

861
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,691
What's going on?

862
00:57:31,716 --> 00:57:33,543
I can't tell this to a man

863
00:57:33,802 --> 00:57:35,738
Oh, I am waiting in the hallway

864
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,160
What,Jun-chan?

865
00:57:46,481 --> 00:57:50,449
Takashima-sensei is broken in the end

866
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,716
I heard it from someone who came to visit me just now

867
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:58,629
You know, the story about the 30 million yen mansion?

868
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,004
Apparently the bank took it away from him
to pay off his debt,

869
00:58:03,888 --> 00:58:08,886
and nowadays, He seems to be selling fakes.

870
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,129
The person lamented that the antiques world's
records have also fallen to the ground

871
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:20,430
The world has become a difficult place for people like him to live in

872
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:23,980
It's not the world's fault

873
00:58:27,970 --> 00:58:32,855
In these harsh times, there's no way he can make a living with such a cheap business

874
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:36,894
Should I ask the teacher to come to my house?

875
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,722
Don't say stupid things

876
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:46,363
Even his old friends don't pay him
any attention anymore

877
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:48,800
Even those people

878
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,776
When teachers used to have money

879
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,699
Everyone was praising the teacher

880
00:58:53,668 --> 00:58:55,574
They were saying he's a genius

881
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:57,137
That's right.

882
00:58:57,868 --> 00:59:02,636
I wonder why people with such hobbies don't want to give money to the teacher

883
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:07,566
I don't know much about art or anything,

884
00:59:08,310 --> 00:59:10,355
but the teacher needs money

885
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,527
If I had it, I would give it all to him.

886
00:59:39,428 --> 00:59:41,066
Thank you for the meal!

887
00:59:48,492 --> 00:59:49,738
Good morning.

888
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,644
Good morning.

889
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,105
Yo-chan!

890
01:00:29,285 --> 01:00:30,504
Welcome!

891
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,449
Welcome!

892
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:35,488
I've brought a rare person with me today

893
01:00:35,677 --> 01:00:36,433
So who is it?

894
01:00:36,723 --> 01:00:38,692
He's liked you for a long time

895
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,418
I wonder what he's doing.

896
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,293
Welcome. Welcome

897
01:00:44,488 --> 01:00:45,340
It's been ages.

898
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:51,269
Maybe you forgot about me for a while?

899
01:00:51,801 --> 01:00:53,652
that's understandable

900
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,886
It's been 15,6 years.

901
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,106
Wow, Non-chan

902
01:01:02,043 --> 01:01:03,176
I'm sorry

903
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,448
but it was good

904
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:07,046
I'm glad you remembered me.

905
01:01:08,931 --> 01:01:10,243
Welcome

906
01:01:13,566 --> 01:01:14,915
You look so nice.

907
01:01:15,371 --> 01:01:16,519
I look like grandmother, right?

908
01:01:16,652 --> 01:01:19,324
You are much more attractive than before.

909
01:01:19,603 --> 01:01:22,885
I explained that to you.

910
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,550
He didn't want to ruin the old image,

911
01:01:25,879 --> 01:01:26,965
Hey come on.

912
01:01:27,262 --> 01:01:27,981
Treat me.

913
01:01:28,343 --> 01:01:31,343
Make me drink that most expensive Napoleon whiskey

914
01:01:31,824 --> 01:01:32,707
Welcome

915
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:33,645
It's fine

916
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,424
Welcome,

917
01:01:34,449 --> 01:01:36,786
this guy was in the same class as me

918
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,636
Unlike us department store managers,

919
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:39,644
He's bourgeois

920
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:41,589
Ah, I'm sure it's something like in Kofu

921
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,582
Yes, that's right

922
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:46,269
He succeeded his father as president of a wine company.

923
01:01:46,451 --> 01:01:48,316
Hey, hey, stop it already.

924
01:01:48,809 --> 01:01:52,324
Anyway, he's having trouble figuring out what to do with the money

925
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,356
Today too

926
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:58,371
I happened to meet him at the Momoyama
art exhibition in our department store

927
01:01:59,020 --> 01:01:59,826
Well, that's fine

928
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:01,144
Everyone, please drink as much as you like

929
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:01,992
Can I have some?

930
01:02:02,584 --> 01:02:04,661
Please, please.
You can drink whatever you like.

931
01:02:04,725 --> 01:02:05,801
Thank you

932
01:02:06,053 --> 01:02:07,082
I'll have brandy cup

933
01:02:07,145 --> 01:02:08,418
Same here.

934
01:02:08,543 --> 01:02:09,230
I'll have juice

935
01:02:09,255 --> 01:02:10,098
I'll have gin.

936
01:02:13,332 --> 01:02:14,051
Thanks.

937
01:02:14,391 --> 01:02:18,151
Back then, all I saw was Non-chan in his school uniform

938
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:21,480
You should have kept an eye on him then.

939
01:02:21,598 --> 01:02:22,535
Really.

940
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:24,824
I'm sure I would have become the president's wife

941
01:02:27,215 --> 01:02:29,910
Sorry, I got carried away with the story

942
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,379
What would you like to eat?

943
01:02:31,770 --> 01:02:32,910
This is Napoleon whiskey.

944
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:35,106
Thanks.

945
01:02:38,449 --> 01:02:40,980
Let's all have a toast.

946
01:02:41,082 --> 01:02:41,723
I'll have.

947
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:43,527
Cheers!

948
01:02:46,789 --> 01:02:48,105
This, this

949
01:02:51,811 --> 01:02:55,449
You suddenly disappeared back then.

950
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,261
I was dragged into the war,

951
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:01,008
so if only it hadn't happened....

952
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:02,277
Stop it....

953
01:03:02,332 --> 01:03:02,910
What?

954
01:03:04,161 --> 01:03:07,847
This guy wanted to marry Yo-chan

955
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:11,393
Sasagara, You confessed that to us earlier.

956
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:13,855
I was not lying

957
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:17,490
But back then, I was still a student living off my parents

958
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:20,621
You were too popular back then

959
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:22,447
No way

960
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,822
Yo-chan's customers were amazing back then

961
01:03:26,486 --> 01:03:30,364
Mr. Kikuchi, Biography, Rintaro Takemoto and Shoichi Yokokawa

962
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Also, all the musicians and painters like Soutaro were fans of Yo-chan

963
01:03:34,183 --> 01:03:36,700
and they were wrecking that bar

964
01:03:37,410 --> 01:03:41,045
And look, did you know the art critic Kenzo Takashima?

965
01:03:42,043 --> 01:03:44,183
You knew him?

966
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,306
Yeah

967
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:47,756
He often scolded me

968
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,843
I don't get lectured often

969
01:03:49,868 --> 01:03:51,288
Was it?

970
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:52,856
Well, why don't you meet him next time?

971
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:54,515
I'm sure he'll miss you

972
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:56,906
Is he still coming here? Of course I want to see him

973
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,140
I'm starting to get interested in antiques

974
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:03,736
There's something I'd really like him to see

975
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:05,326
Maybe he'll come by tonight

976
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,220
Tonight? That's a shame

977
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,136
I can't relax much tonight

978
01:04:10,307 --> 01:04:11,066
Oh no, that's no good

979
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:12,085
I have to go soon

980
01:04:13,876 --> 01:04:15,477
I have to catch a 7 o'clock flight to Kansai

981
01:04:15,502 --> 01:04:17,448
No rush

982
01:04:17,473 --> 01:04:19,109
I don't want to postpone it next time

983
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,866
I'll come back when I've had enough

984
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:21,933
I'm sure I'll come

985
01:04:22,087 --> 01:04:24,304
Hey Sahara, take your time.

986
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:25,799
Bill please

987
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:29,010
If you give us it, I'll lose contact

988
01:04:29,266 --> 01:04:30,702
I will definitely come

989
01:04:30,842 --> 01:04:32,069
I don't trust you

990
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:34,001
Keep going.

991
01:04:35,458 --> 01:04:36,398
Oh my god.

992
01:04:39,852 --> 01:04:41,948
Oh, that's right. Then I'll leave this here until then

993
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,428
It's a rare watch

994
01:04:46,922 --> 01:04:48,002
My late father's

995
01:04:48,230 --> 01:04:50,456
This was the watch that he gave to his first girl friend

996
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:52,058
Why do you have that?

997
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,356
I always stay there whenever I'm in Tokyo

998
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,226
Thank you.

999
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,156
Are you dating with her?

1000
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:00,546
Come on

1001
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,036
She run an inn in Yugawara

1002
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:03,608
I stayed there yesterday too,

1003
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,360
but I asked her to give it to me

1004
01:05:06,006 --> 01:05:08,362
It seems to be a survivor where my father went to France a long time ago

1005
01:05:09,500 --> 01:05:10,826
That's nice

1006
01:05:11,060 --> 01:05:13,398
If he doesn't come, I'll take it

1007
01:05:19,323 --> 01:05:21,087
That would be a great way to celebrate

1008
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,855
Okay, then I'll lend it to you

1009
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,496
If you like it, use it

1010
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,956
But this is a memento of your father

1011
01:05:28,998 --> 01:05:29,491
Don't worry.

1012
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,205
Just take it

1013
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:34,098
Wow, I'm so happy.

1014
01:05:34,212 --> 01:05:35,985
Has the customer from Seibi arrived?

1015
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:38,786
That's right, I have something I'm taking care of

1016
01:05:41,351 --> 01:05:44,138
How about the three of us go to Yugawara together?

1017
01:05:44,258 --> 01:05:44,845
That's great

1018
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:46,076
shall we go?

1019
01:05:46,100 --> 01:05:50,128
If the teacher goes, I should thank the person who brought this watch.

1020
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:51,259
That's right.

1021
01:05:56,609 --> 01:06:00,507
Wakanourazu, isn't this unusual for Takihara?

1022
01:06:01,182 --> 01:06:04,182
It's quite good, it's from Edo period, isn't it?

1023
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:07,043
Is this yours?

1024
01:06:07,110 --> 01:06:10,428
No, I was asked by the publisher

1025
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:11,506
Is it for sale?

1026
01:06:11,530 --> 01:06:14,176
Yes, there is silver in the gold

1027
01:06:14,200 --> 01:06:16,176
Well, 7 or 80000 yen would be a good deal

1028
01:06:16,390 --> 01:06:18,310
7 or 80000 yen...

1029
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:20,176
If it was at least 50,000 yen, I'd be ok with it

1030
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:23,200
Like a child, when I see it, I want it right away

1031
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,043
Yeah, that's good

1032
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,736
Because I was told to leave it to me

1033
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:27,485
Is that so?

1034
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,067
I'm sorry about that

1035
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,529
Let's take this to Yugawara.

1036
01:06:37,908 --> 01:06:39,748
Thank you very much.

1037
01:06:45,295 --> 01:06:48,408
How about going to an old place tonight?

1038
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,636
Most of the Madam there have changed

1039
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,660
But Lupin and Cytheria

1040
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,936
Just the name sounds nostalgic, doesn't it?

1041
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:58,106
Okay, come on,
Why don't you join us,Oyo?

1042
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,255
I'll call them

1043
01:07:10,106 --> 01:07:13,597
Oyo, isn't it about time to break up with Shimizu?

1044
01:07:14,763 --> 01:07:16,363
That's not going to happen

1045
01:07:17,598 --> 01:07:20,668
You always fall in love with men who don't have money.

1046
01:08:07,254 --> 01:08:08,011
Good morning

1047
01:08:08,655 --> 01:08:11,655
I heard you were drinking wine with a guy from your company.

1048
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:12,856
but you couldn't give this back?

1049
01:08:13,098 --> 01:08:15,098
He gave it to me.

1050
01:08:17,845 --> 01:08:19,152
Wow, that's generous.

1051
01:08:25,754 --> 01:08:27,082
So...

1052
01:08:27,549 --> 01:08:29,366
Are you leaving already?

1053
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,324
 Yes,the director is calling me at 11 o'clock

1054
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:34,956
The ratings for my show have been dropping lately

1055
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:36,276
I might got scolded

1056
01:08:36,690 --> 01:08:37,973
Then see you on Saturday

1057
01:08:38,356 --> 01:08:40,112
Oh, what was it?

1058
01:08:40,379 --> 01:08:41,319
Oh....

1059
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,006
I told you we were going to Kinugawa for an overnight stay

1060
01:08:45,236 --> 01:08:46,616
I forgot it

1061
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:48,666
I was in trouble

1062
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:49,527
Why?

1063
01:08:51,957 --> 01:08:55,112
I promised to go to Yugawara on Sunday.

1064
01:08:55,738 --> 01:08:56,875
With whom?

1065
01:08:57,140 --> 01:09:00,621
Nogata-san and Takashima-sensei

1066
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:02,160
Can't I do it next time?

1067
01:09:02,185 --> 01:09:04,847
No,I told you yesterday.I won't be off work for a while

1068
01:09:05,249 --> 01:09:06,725
Have you forgotten that?

1069
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:09,746
I was so drunk yesterday.

1070
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:10,980
I don't remember anything

1071
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,530
Even if you remember his promises , but you forget my promises

1072
01:09:24,040 --> 01:09:25,975
You shouldn't say it like that,

1073
01:09:26,602 --> 01:09:27,382
Refuse their promise

1074
01:09:28,470 --> 01:09:29,971
That's not the case

1075
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,171
They are my customers

1076
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,463
so just say you received a watch.

1077
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:35,112
I don't even know what you did yesterday

1078
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,795
Are you serious?

1079
01:09:40,366 --> 01:09:41,606
It's rude to say something like that.

1080
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:45,357
You are a hostess anyway.

1081
01:09:46,488 --> 01:09:48,055
I've done this kind of drama before

1082
01:09:49,696 --> 01:09:50,663
What do you mean?

1083
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:56,963
I didn't expect to be humiliated.
You switched to the president of the wine company.

1084
01:09:58,153 --> 01:09:59,313
I am bar woman

1085
01:10:00,126 --> 01:10:02,259
Isn't it natural to cherish the rich?

1086
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:04,347
If you don't like it, just go home

1087
01:10:09,993 --> 01:10:11,167
I'll go home without being told

1088
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,423
That's right, I owe Takashima-sensei 5,000 yen

1089
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:48,732
I have 5000 yen in my handbag

1090
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:52,518
This was the car fee  Nogata-san gave me last night,

1091
01:10:57,565 --> 01:10:58,371
I tell you

1092
01:10:59,476 --> 01:11:03,144
but if you open a girl's handbag without saying anything like that, she'll hate you.

1093
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,787
I've been cheated by you till now.

1094
01:12:19,421 --> 01:12:21,640
So please take your time

1095
01:12:24,170 --> 01:12:25,724
Please.

1096
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,925
Do you know there's a guest in the Five-Person Autumn-Leaf Room?

1097
01:12:40,090 --> 01:12:40,775
Yes, I understand

1098
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:42,862
Oh, Master

1099
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,396
please check this

1100
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:50,117
How do you like it?

1101
01:12:51,243 --> 01:12:53,575
He's a very nice guy, isn't he?

1102
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,980
I understand why you do watch business

1103
01:12:57,220 --> 01:12:59,531
I see, that's good

1104
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:02,775
but I don't agree

1105
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:08,767
She's so beautiful as a woman

1106
01:13:09,515 --> 01:13:10,599
What do you mean?

1107
01:13:11,174 --> 01:13:14,148
Any man would fall in love with her

1108
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,250
I wonder if such a person is not suited to be the master of the inn

1109
01:13:19,016 --> 01:13:20,909
If men come from Tokyo all the time,

1110
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:23,157
it will be a shame for the inn

1111
01:13:24,460 --> 01:13:25,727
She has no men

1112
01:13:27,442 --> 01:13:29,098
Don't get mad

1113
01:13:30,169 --> 01:13:32,424
Well, she's has no men right now

1114
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:39,611
But what I'm saying is, you never know when she'll find a man

1115
01:13:40,410 --> 01:13:42,334
You never know what's going to happen in the future

1116
01:13:43,499 --> 01:13:46,254
So you don't like if she takes over?

1117
01:13:50,322 --> 01:13:53,822
I've been making it since your father's time

1118
01:13:54,230 --> 01:13:56,319
so I'm not thinking about my own selfish gain

1119
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:00,400
A woman can understand a woman when she sees her

1120
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,339
You just met her today

1121
01:14:05,832 --> 01:14:06,898
Young master

1122
01:14:08,058 --> 01:14:12,957
When I spoke to you the other day, I asked the Private Investigation Agency to look into it

1123
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,907
Of course, I don't take these things at face value

1124
01:14:20,440 --> 01:14:25,306
She's met a lot of different people, like
novelists and painters

1125
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,410
She's a bar girl

1126
01:14:27,435 --> 01:14:29,311
Well, there must have been a lot in the past

1127
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,262
But I'm aware of that too

1128
01:14:33,693 --> 01:14:34,847
I got it

1129
01:14:35,380 --> 01:14:37,436
If so, there's no need to rush.

1130
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,530
Let's take a closer look

1131
01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:45,430
I guess you haven't talked about taking her here yet

1132
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:47,684
Not yet.

1133
01:14:48,873 --> 01:14:51,873
And the antiques teacher who is also there

1134
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:56,110
I'm a bit curious about that person too

1135
01:14:59,494 --> 01:15:01,309
I get so drunk today

1136
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:03,111
It's rare.

1137
01:15:03,990 --> 01:15:05,796
You aren't drunk at all yet

1138
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:10,770
It would be a problem if Oyone disliked me for drinking

1139
01:15:12,272 --> 01:15:12,912
Oyo

1140
01:15:14,349 --> 01:15:18,384
You're a girl who can't stand the lifestyle,

1141
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:21,229
but this time you'll have to be patient

1142
01:15:22,550 --> 01:15:24,633
If you feel like you're dead, there's nothing I can't do

1143
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:30,187
I'm going to work hard and not make you suffer financially this time

1144
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,569
Don't care about me

1145
01:15:34,850 --> 01:15:37,850
Hey, Oyone is kind of nice

1146
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:41,927
I want to be like her when I get older

1147
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:45,647
I think I'd get along well with that person.

1148
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:49,765
I'm drunk

1149
01:15:55,979 --> 01:15:57,199
Are you alright?

1150
01:16:03,672 --> 01:16:05,925
I apologize for having to step away.

1151
01:16:06,023 --> 01:16:07,083
Oh you are here!

1152
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,603
Tell Oyone

1153
01:16:10,983 --> 01:16:12,577
Oyo has no men besides me

1154
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,505
I am her man

1155
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:18,549
Hey, where is my room?

1156
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,586
I'll show you

1157
01:16:19,611 --> 01:16:20,369
Teacher

1158
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:22,420
Good night

1159
01:16:28,911 --> 01:16:33,259
Is it really that unusual for someone like
Takashima to drink alcohol in a hot spring?

1160
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:37,345
The teacher was very happy with this story

1161
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:42,286
What did Oyone say?

1162
01:16:43,592 --> 01:16:46,592
she said you should try helping her out until you get used to it

1163
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:50,017
Will I be able to work?

1164
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:53,197
That's why she thinks of me
as his real son

1165
01:16:54,413 --> 01:16:55,945
She cares about you a lot too.

1166
01:16:58,040 --> 01:17:01,259
What a wonderful garden

1167
01:17:02,868 --> 01:17:06,212
How nice it would be to live
a relaxed life in such a fresh air

1168
01:17:09,940 --> 01:17:14,415
I'm tired of going back to cramped bars and apartments

1169
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:17,353
When I think about it like this,

1170
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,994
it seems like I've been dead until now

1171
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:23,908
I won't let you feel that way.

1172
01:18:18,853 --> 01:18:20,010
Come on, let's go.

1173
01:18:38,635 --> 01:18:39,350
I'm back.

1174
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:40,267
Welcome back.

1175
01:18:46,244 --> 01:18:48,674
Mr. President of Kofu is here.

1176
01:18:55,916 --> 01:18:56,892
I'm back.

1177
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:58,330
Welcome back.

1178
01:19:00,035 --> 01:19:01,072
Thank you for your hard work

1179
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,136
How is it? Have you gotten used to it?

1180
01:19:07,885 --> 01:19:08,666
I think so.

1181
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:10,923
That's a good thing

1182
01:19:13,752 --> 01:19:14,768
By the way.

1183
01:19:15,354 --> 01:19:18,354
I was just talking to Oyone-san,

1184
01:19:20,426 --> 01:19:23,426
but can you please break up with Takashima-san?

1185
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:28,896
What do you mean by break up?

1186
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,275
if the way I say things like this is wrong,

1187
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:35,020
I'd rather you just not have him to come here anymore

1188
01:19:37,151 --> 01:19:39,353
Apparently he stayed for two nights while I was away

1189
01:19:39,455 --> 01:19:39,838
Non-chan

1190
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:48,172
Also, I didn't want to say this, but I'm causing financial trouble to Takashima-san

1191
01:19:48,870 --> 01:19:51,103
Well, it's not a huge amount

1192
01:19:52,192 --> 01:19:54,098
Even so, If it is made public

1193
01:19:54,152 --> 01:19:55,444
He is a fraudster

1194
01:19:59,090 --> 01:20:00,994
If you want to bring it up,

1195
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:03,266
Can I settle the matter?

1196
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,751
What do you think?

1197
01:20:08,776 --> 01:20:10,056
You just keep quiet.

1198
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,016
Hello? yes

1199
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:22,392
He's here.

1200
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,337
From the Tokyo branch

1201
01:20:26,025 --> 01:20:27,705
I will pass it on to you.

1202
01:20:29,244 --> 01:20:30,603
Please

1203
01:20:30,916 --> 01:20:31,572
Yes?

1204
01:20:34,814 --> 01:20:35,932
I know

1205
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:38,267
What?

1206
01:20:40,590 --> 01:20:42,134
Of course I've paid

1207
01:20:43,450 --> 01:20:45,337
We were just talking about that now

1208
01:20:46,690 --> 01:20:49,690
I guess I should have told you first so as not to make things too complicated

1209
01:20:52,375 --> 01:20:54,697
I'm going there tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.

1210
01:21:06,232 --> 01:21:06,992
Yo-chan.

1211
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,181
Well, you remember this, right?

1212
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,919
Apparently Takashima did it again

1213
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:20,522
Apparently, the only things that haven't been given to the other party are the 200,000 yen that I paid for this and the Kiseto cup I bought later

1214
01:21:20,990 --> 01:21:23,636
My company has just received an inquiry

1215
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:26,660
It turned out I hadn't paid

1216
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:32,248
It's sad that people only think about what happens if they worry about it

1217
01:21:33,805 --> 01:21:36,227
Isn't this the right time?

1218
01:21:36,676 --> 01:21:37,496
Yoko.

1219
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,368
Thank you.

1220
01:21:53,015 --> 01:21:54,218
Oh I see.

1221
01:21:56,586 --> 01:22:00,274
Yo-chan has gone to Yugawara for a week

1222
01:22:03,259 --> 01:22:05,365
Mom is  in the hospital

1223
01:22:05,390 --> 01:22:06,691
No customers will come if we keep doing this.

1224
01:22:11,752 --> 01:22:13,285
Welcome.

1225
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,200
Welcome.

1226
01:22:16,251 --> 01:22:17,921
It's been a while, teacher

1227
01:22:18,108 --> 01:22:18,768
It's been a while

1228
01:22:20,087 --> 01:22:21,149
What would you like?

1229
01:22:22,095 --> 01:22:23,366
You like whiskey,right?

1230
01:22:23,390 --> 01:22:23,988
Yes

1231
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:26,022
How about Takashima?

1232
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,954
He hasn’t seen me in a while

1233
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,646
That's a good place to be

1234
01:22:41,221 --> 01:22:42,234
In the end

1235
01:22:50,152 --> 01:22:52,147
Is Madame suffering from breast sick?

1236
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:54,606
She collapsed after New Year's

1237
01:22:54,630 --> 01:22:55,885
That's a big problem

1238
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,466
Sometimes when I come here

1239
01:23:03,490 --> 01:23:04,698
I feel a bit strange.

1240
01:23:10,566 --> 01:23:11,392
Welcome

1241
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:14,729
Haven't you lost some weight?

1242
01:23:15,109 --> 01:23:15,969
You think so?

1243
01:23:16,876 --> 01:23:17,892
You look better

1244
01:23:20,340 --> 01:23:22,407
You've calmed down too

1245
01:23:22,690 --> 01:23:24,764
Yeah, it seems

1246
01:23:26,163 --> 01:23:28,027
You were always frustrated back then

1247
01:23:28,525 --> 01:23:30,265
but there were good things too

1248
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:32,899
We met around here at Yugawara Station

1249
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,791
I really wanted to call out to you

1250
01:23:37,573 --> 01:23:38,453
Same here.

1251
01:23:40,019 --> 01:23:41,365
Let's go to Box

1252
01:23:41,841 --> 01:23:43,347
Welcome

1253
01:23:45,064 --> 01:23:46,057
Welcome

1254
01:23:46,872 --> 01:23:47,799
Welcome

1255
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,937
I heard you met a good husband and going to stay at Yugarwara Inn

1256
01:23:54,009 --> 01:23:56,129
Takashima-sensei tells me to be patient,

1257
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:58,516
It's his habit to tell you to be patient

1258
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,617
When it was my turn, he told me to break up

1259
01:24:04,978 --> 01:24:06,112
Did you feel resentful?

1260
01:24:06,760 --> 01:24:09,760
Or did you not listen to what he said?

1261
01:24:11,299 --> 01:24:14,299
You've always disliked Takashima-sensei

1262
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:15,856
For me,

1263
01:24:15,880 --> 01:24:18,880
I hate the way women treat each other

1264
01:24:19,830 --> 01:24:22,830
He's actually in love with you but he's scared to sleep with you

1265
01:24:24,650 --> 01:24:27,650
That's why he despises people who are with you

1266
01:24:29,270 --> 01:24:33,868
He's trying to win your heart by selling the fact that he won't hold your hand

1267
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:37,608
I don't want to hand you over to that guy

1268
01:24:40,930 --> 01:24:43,930
But I'll follow him.

1269
01:24:46,556 --> 01:24:51,966
You've been in dealing with various
men for a long time in the Ginza bar world

1270
01:24:53,970 --> 01:24:55,896
When you're in this business,

1271
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,920
you start to get tired of being connected only to guys

1272
01:25:00,306 --> 01:25:01,757
At times like that

1273
01:25:02,173 --> 01:25:06,880
A man like Takashima looks so beautiful and impressive for you

1274
01:25:10,863 --> 01:25:12,656
I think that's the kind of relationship you have

1275
01:25:13,926 --> 01:25:17,399
It's dangerous to follow a man like him

1276
01:25:17,860 --> 01:25:20,860
It's like blind person is pulling blind person's hand

1277
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,010
Aren't you blind person?

1278
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:30,100
I don't care about such troublesome things anymore

1279
01:25:33,553 --> 01:25:38,482
When I think about it now, it all seems like a long time ago

1280
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,855
One day I tagged along on your trip to the park to see the cherry blossoms in Yoshino

1281
01:25:46,260 --> 01:25:47,936
Oh it was beautiful

1282
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,373
I didn't even notice the flowers blooming this year

1283
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:54,048
Has it already scattered?

1284
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,826
That's right, the evening paper was out

1285
01:25:58,850 --> 01:26:06,069
I'd like to see the cherry blossoms in front of the British Embassy, Benkei Bridge, Aoyama Cemetery, or somewhere else

1286
01:26:06,914 --> 01:26:08,074
I'd like to see

1287
01:26:10,370 --> 01:26:11,467
Shall we take there now?

1288
01:26:47,043 --> 01:26:48,204
It's so pretty

1289
01:26:51,022 --> 01:26:51,982
It's so pretty

1290
01:26:54,513 --> 01:26:56,328
I feel like eating it.

1291
01:27:00,890 --> 01:27:02,710
I'm not going home tonight

1292
01:27:04,096 --> 01:27:06,885
You're the one who went back to your wife and daughter

1293
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:08,572
You're going to Yugawara,right?

1294
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,012
For Takashima-san's sake

1295
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,830
I won't be going home tonight

1296
01:27:34,703 --> 01:27:35,223
OK

1297
01:27:38,290 --> 01:27:41,290
In return, I'll play with you just for today

1298
01:27:44,161 --> 01:27:44,848
Yoko...

1299
01:27:47,550 --> 01:27:49,638
Because the cherry blossoms are blooming

1300
01:28:17,155 --> 01:28:19,571
I'm pretty sure Oyo was born around here too

1301
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:25,952
My grandmother, who loved me, often took me
to the Juban night market when I was a child

1302
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,211
How is Mishima's mother?

1303
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,536
I'm planning to send her a letter tonight

1304
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,236
Tonight?

1305
01:28:48,914 --> 01:28:49,777
Teacher

1306
01:28:51,731 --> 01:28:52,544
I’m sorry.

1307
01:28:54,680 --> 01:28:57,122
I couldn't hold back in Yugawara
after all

1308
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:03,543
I tried my best, but I'm really sorry,

1309
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:05,331
You are such an idiot

1310
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:08,892
You didn't care if
it was for me

1311
01:29:09,650 --> 01:29:11,626
Did the other party bring it up?

1312
01:29:11,674 --> 01:29:12,388
No, didn't

1313
01:29:13,692 --> 01:29:16,881
He tell you to break up with me?

1314
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:22,531
I was the one who said I wanted to break up with you

1315
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:28,678
In return...I never want to see that person's face again

1316
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:33,068
I didn't mean to ruin your conversation,

1317
01:29:33,500 --> 01:29:36,500
but I've been pressed for money for the mansion's lawsuit

1318
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:38,136
It's not the teacher's fault

1319
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:40,201
Of course, I had planned to cover the expenses.

1320
01:29:48,373 --> 01:29:51,373
Well, this is also going to happen

1321
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:56,389
Speaking of things happening,
things are strange between you and me

1322
01:29:57,602 --> 01:29:59,808
I'd only ever been jealous of once

1323
01:30:01,145 --> 01:30:03,099
It was when I was in Yugawara for the first time

1324
01:30:05,196 --> 01:30:08,196
You were really drunk that time

1325
01:30:09,312 --> 01:30:11,609
but maybe it was because the other person was a rich guy

1326
01:30:25,063 --> 01:30:25,870
Teacher?

1327
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:28,964
I'm going to die

1328
01:30:31,896 --> 01:30:33,225
That's already decided

1329
01:30:34,114 --> 01:30:35,538
Don't be stupid

1330
01:30:35,778 --> 01:30:36,765
You are beautiful

1331
01:30:37,450 --> 01:30:38,608
The flowers still bloom

1332
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,903
I want to die while I'm still beautiful

1333
01:30:45,690 --> 01:30:47,568
No human being is worth committing suicide for

1334
01:31:38,297 --> 01:31:39,691
Thank you very much.

1335
01:31:48,212 --> 01:31:49,505
You left your underwear

1336
01:32:12,557 --> 01:32:17,642
The letter was a suicide note addressed to his mother-in-law in Mishima

1337
01:32:25,675 --> 01:32:28,262
I'll send you the apartment keys

1338
01:32:34,030 --> 01:32:36,606
Although we are not related by blood,

1339
01:32:36,630 --> 01:32:40,612
thank you for raising me since I was little

1340
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,808
This is the last time,

1341
01:32:46,420 --> 01:32:49,420
so please clean up after yourself

1342
01:32:50,290 --> 01:32:52,216
I'm like a found child,

1343
01:32:53,066 --> 01:32:54,400
so don't put me in the grave

1344
01:32:54,540 --> 01:32:56,973
I would be happier if they turned it into an abandoned grave

1345
01:32:57,132 --> 01:33:01,473
and put it in a temple somewhere in Tokyo

1346
01:33:04,875 --> 01:33:08,409
The apartment deposit should be enough money

1347
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:18,492
I think you're just saying selfish things and not expressing your true feelings

1348
01:33:19,763 --> 01:33:24,097
Maybe that's what leaving a note is all about

1349
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:32,705
I don't want anyone to know that I'm dead

1350
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:36,941
I am dying with such a good feeling,

1351
01:33:38,638 --> 01:33:42,453
so please don't cry or feel sorry for me.

1352
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,700
Goodbye

1353
01:35:45,952 --> 01:35:48,679
She thought she was cleaning up quickly,

1354
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:54,766
but Yoko might have actually been moving
around slowly

1355
01:36:07,343 --> 01:36:13,085
Suddenly she became worried that something had gone wrong

1356
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:15,036
and she would fail

1357
01:36:15,493 --> 01:36:19,127
She was extremely angry
that such anxiety had arisen

1358
01:36:23,482 --> 01:36:26,637
Once she started to get angry, there was no stopping it

1359
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:30,380
She got angry about everything and everything

1360
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:38,254
To Matsuzaki, Junko, and Ayako...

1361
01:36:47,989 --> 01:36:52,122
She found the room very small and stuffy.

1362
01:36:55,670 --> 01:37:03,677
She was very angry at herself for living in such a small room.

1363
01:37:07,326 --> 01:37:11,685
She was upset about something she had spent so much time preparing.

1364
01:37:42,850 --> 01:37:45,850
However, when she finished taking the medicine,

1365
01:37:47,230 --> 01:37:50,230
something welled up in her chest,

1366
01:37:50,940 --> 01:37:53,940
and she thought she could finally cry

1367
01:37:54,183 --> 01:37:57,183
It didn't turn to tears.

1368
01:38:18,360 --> 01:38:20,125
And darkness came.

1369
01:38:41,629 --> 01:38:52,078
THE END

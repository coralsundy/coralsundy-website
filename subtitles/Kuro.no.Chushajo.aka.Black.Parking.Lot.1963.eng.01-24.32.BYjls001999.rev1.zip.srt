00:00:17,107 --> 00:00:23,784
Kuro no Chushajo / Black Parking Lot (1963)

3
00:01:48,076 --> 00:01:54,056
I am Mitsugi Tsunonuma, the new president of Maruki Pharmaceutical Co.

4
00:01:55,998 --> 00:01:59,778
Maruki Pharmaceutical has not performed well over the past few years.

5
00:02:00,804 --> 00:02:05,437
This is not only due to the passive and negligent policies of the previous president.

6
00:02:06,435 --> 00:02:11,409
It is because you have lost the will to fight for your respective jobs.

7
00:02:12,131 --> 00:02:17,071
I intend to rebuild Maruki Pharmaceutical into a completely new company.

8
00:02:17,769 --> 00:02:23,203
The personnel changes announced today are targeted at the senior management level.

9
00:02:24,274 --> 00:02:32,446
We intend to continue to move all employees to new workplaces and fundamentally improve the company's structure.

10
00:02:41,057 --> 00:02:42,863
Congratulations, Matsuzaki.

11
00:02:43,345 --> 00:02:44,624
I hear you're the only one staying on.

12
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:45,612
I don't know if I can glad..

13
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:48,271
The new president have good eyes.
I'm so relieved.

14
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:54,358
What can I do for you?

15
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,109
The president wants to see you.

16
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,090
Why would he call me?
Even the former president didn't talk to me.

17
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:05,635
You'll see if you meet him.

18
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,964
This is Mr. Izumi Izumida of Izumi Chemicals.

19
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:15,690
I'm Izumida.

20
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,830
Oh you.

21
00:03:17,732 --> 00:03:20,438
Matsuzaki told me all about you.
Have a seat.

22
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,280
I hear you're quite hard worker, Izumida-kun.

23
00:03:26,424 --> 00:03:29,251
No, I owe everything to Mr. Matsuzaki.

24
00:03:29,996 --> 00:03:33,023
I learned a lot about drugs from him, even about starting the factory I'm in now.

25
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,622
I'm the same.
I know nothing about drugs.

26
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:45,195
I'm calling a special meeting of the stockholders soon.
You'll probably be promoted to the board of directors there.

27
00:03:47,438 --> 00:03:49,731
But I'm not good enough for the position.

28
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:53,985
The people I brought in only know about the stock market.

29
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:57,219
So please support me.

30
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:05,509
By the way, Mr. Izumida.
I'm going to tell you straight out, I think you and our company should merge.

31
00:04:06,201 --> 00:04:08,641
I promise you a considerable post.

32
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:14,891
I'm sure there's no mistaking your ability that Mr. Matsuzaki sees in you.

33
00:04:15,985 --> 00:04:20,811
I don't want a relationship between a subcontractor and a parent company.
I want you to cooperate with me.

34
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:23,017
What do you think?

35
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,284
I'm sorry to hear you say that so suddenly.

36
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:31,900
It's a tiny factory, but it took me five years to get it going.

37
00:04:32,206 --> 00:04:37,926
But the big pharmaceutical companies do so at the expense of their many subcontractors.

38
00:04:38,473 --> 00:04:42,806
I want to clean up the situation and correct the state of the pharmaceutical industry.

39
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:47,891
What do you think?
Let's merge and live together in harmony.

40
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,503
Mr. President, we'll talk about it later.

41
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:24,731
Thank you.

42
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,189
What's the matter? Anemia again?

43
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,989
You need to rest.

44
00:05:34,014 --> 00:05:36,194
You get anemia a lot.

45
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,740
Their perform is getting better.

46
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,550
I like the bright performance.
Let's put the dark past behind us.

47
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:54,978
What happened to the merger after that?

48
00:05:55,606 --> 00:05:59,146
I left it to Matsuzaki.
He is my benefactor.

49
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,587
I wanna stay here.

50
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:05,640
I don't wanna work in big company.

51
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:10,173
A big company will dump you at retirement after 36 years of work.

52
00:06:10,353 --> 00:06:11,933
I will do my best.

53
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,086
Hello.

54
00:06:15,657 --> 00:06:18,663
I'm going to be featuring IZUMIYA's new drug in an upcoming feature.

55
00:06:19,863 --> 00:06:23,570
I know it's a secret, but I'm going to ask you specifically today.

56
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:25,724
I need to see Mr. Hattori.

57
00:06:26,424 --> 00:06:28,431
Okay, but...
I wonder what he'll say.

58
00:06:29,864 --> 00:06:31,371
Hattori

59
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:39,995
Did you call on me?

60
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,915
I would like you to explain your research on soil fungi

61
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:49,307
Since your last discovery, emerging organisms have been the subject of worldwide research.

62
00:06:50,635 --> 00:06:55,928
They work great, but they're hard to cultivate.
And there's also the problem of the commercial base.

63
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:58,444
How do you plan to resolve those issues?

64
00:06:58,857 --> 00:07:01,717
We can't reach a conclusion until we've done clinical trials.

65
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:07,911
Is there production?

66
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,775
It's no use researching something that has no production.

67
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:13,635
Can't you be more specific?

68
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,187
You'll note it?

69
00:07:15,786 --> 00:07:19,131
The new president of MARUKI asked me to do some publicity.

70
00:07:19,344 --> 00:07:22,896
I'm not working for Maruki but here.

71
00:07:23,046 --> 00:07:26,397
But Parent company Maruki is the distributor, right?

72
00:07:27,173 --> 00:07:31,270
The world is very picky.
I wish you'd leave me alone before you finish it.

73
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,868
Wait.

74
00:07:36,897 --> 00:07:42,620
I stopped some advance publicity for your new drug.
You have to take good care of that.

75
00:07:43,553 --> 00:07:45,735
Stopped?
I see.

76
00:07:46,762 --> 00:07:48,210
Hattori will be relieved

77
00:07:50,576 --> 00:07:54,291
Please judge the recent merger from MATSUZAKI's point of view.

78
00:07:55,551 --> 00:08:00,357
Don't worry about me.
I worry about Matsuzaki's position.

79
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:02,974
You are as loyal as ever, aren't you?

80
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,441
I need his support.

81
00:08:07,443 --> 00:08:09,758
I'm not capable of running a factory in the first place.

82
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,880
You've raised a golden egg
You finally got your hands on a new drug.

83
00:08:14,497 --> 00:08:15,824
You are good business man.

84
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:22,043
If Mr. Matsuzaki hadn't picked me up, I would have been nothing.

85
00:08:24,523 --> 00:08:28,481
But to merge with Maruki is ridiculous.

86
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,178
Maruki has something wrong?

87
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:33,522
No, not really.

88
00:08:36,957 --> 00:08:39,832
Did you apply for a partial patent on the manufacturing process?

89
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,566
I did as you asked, but no one else can do what we did.

90
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:50,379
You should be too careful.
You're familiar with the woes of subcontractors.

91
00:08:52,868 --> 00:08:54,712
How's Noriko?

92
00:08:56,368 --> 00:08:58,860
She's female writer.
She works well.

93
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:03,767
She was also very capable when she was my secretary.
She's the kind of girl who can handle anything.

94
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,618
I think you and her are good match.

95
00:09:08,689 --> 00:09:10,978
It is better for you to remarry.

96
00:09:13,532 --> 00:09:16,001
I know your relationship.

97
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,728
Marriage is troublesome.

98
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:22,212
Welcome.

99
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:25,540
Excuse me.

100
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:28,383
Well...I have to leave now.

101
00:09:28,603 --> 00:09:31,165
Please stay for a while.

102
00:09:31,346 --> 00:09:32,619
I'm going on a business trip tomorrow.

103
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:33,431
To where?

104
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,807
Osaka sales office.
I have to leave now.

105
00:09:36,103 --> 00:09:38,338
I'm sorry.

106
00:09:38,682 --> 00:09:40,244
See you soon.

107
00:09:41,127 --> 00:09:43,135
Please see him off.

108
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:45,228
You can leave.

109
00:09:45,564 --> 00:09:46,869
Wait here.

110
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:50,307
Take your time.

111
00:09:51,071 --> 00:09:53,103
You don't have to worry about anything, do you?

112
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:54,525
She know how he feels.

113
00:09:56,862 --> 00:09:58,745
Thank you very much.

114
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,987
You stay here.

115
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:01,604
I don't want to be kicked by a horse.

116
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,354
What do you mean by that?

117
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:05,924
Anyone who interferes with my factory should be kicked to death by a horse.

118
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:08,487
I'm leaving.

119
00:10:13,338 --> 00:10:16,189
I'll call you as soon as I get home.
There's someone I'd really like you to meet.

120
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:17,814
See you soon.

121
00:10:18,143 --> 00:10:19,072
Who?

122
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,650
Hey, old man, let me help you with something.

123
00:10:35,095 --> 00:10:37,524
you don't have to take care of this old car.

124
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:38,736
Do not touch.

125
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:43,752
I bought this car with my retirement money after 36 years of work.

126
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:48,056
I have a little left over to pay for my family's future and to pay off my debts.

127
00:10:48,227 --> 00:10:50,344
It's always been a dream of mine to own a car.

128
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:54,798
What a waste.
He worked his whole life and this is all he had left.

129
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:58,244
Your retirement allowance was very small.

130
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,900
Damn it.

131
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:05,001
He worked seriously unlike you guys.

132
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:10,524
When it's money you've worked so hard for, no matter how little it costs, it's worth it.

133
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:12,025
I'm off to college.

134
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:13,290
Take care of your bag.

135
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:13,884
Don't worry.

136
00:11:14,368 --> 00:11:15,540
I wouldn't let it go if I was dead.

137
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,118
Come on.

138
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,454
Mr. President, phone call for you.

139
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,408
From Police.

140
00:11:19,993 --> 00:11:20,618
Police?

141
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:24,398
One of you guys did something.

142
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,568
Hello,I'm Izumuda.

143
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:38,643
What?

144
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,158
Matsuzaki's dead?

145
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,547
He jumped from a cliff?

146
00:11:48,618 --> 00:11:49,922
He committed suicide?

147
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,267
I can't believe it.

148
00:12:00,228 --> 00:12:02,243
He committed suicide.

149
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,626
But the police were very clear about that.

150
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,798
But why here?

151
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:12,157
He told me There's someone he'd really like me to meet.

152
00:12:12,571 --> 00:12:13,946
I wonder who is it.

153
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:19,767
I have no idea.
Mr. Matsuzaki was acting strange that night.

154
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,589
His wife had died.
Matsuzaki, you were all alone, weren't you?

155
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,027
He took care of you and me like we were his own children.

156
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:36,993
I told him I wanted to become a reporter for a trade newspaper.
He introduced me to The Pharmaceutical Times.

157
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:39,486
He must have been alone.

158
00:12:41,673 --> 00:12:43,540
I shouldn't have quit my job as secretary.

159
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:46,564
Forget it.

160
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,072
He won't come back to life.

161
00:13:29,723 --> 00:13:31,192
I feel sorry.

162
00:13:32,184 --> 00:13:34,458
He was an important card for Maruki.

163
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,637
I feel sorry.

164
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:41,981
I will take care of you in his place.

165
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:44,977
See you.

166
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:56,478
He has just been appointed president and will immediately control the funeral.

167
00:13:59,682 --> 00:14:00,448
That's strange.

168
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:01,901
What?

169
00:14:02,463 --> 00:14:04,916
The most important person hasn't arrived yet.

170
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,602
Who?

171
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,196
His Mistress.

172
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:12,376
She works at the bar. They were like married.

173
00:14:14,243 --> 00:14:17,516
I didn't know there was such a person.

174
00:14:37,072 --> 00:14:38,854
Who's her?

175
00:14:40,018 --> 00:14:43,096
Yoshino Natsuko, the president of Yoshino Pharmaceutical.

176
00:14:43,877 --> 00:14:46,744
She's very famous in the industry.

177
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,205
Maruki Company and Yoshino Company are rival companies.

178
00:14:55,338 --> 00:14:56,916
There is something wrong.

179
00:15:03,038 --> 00:15:04,866
I feel sorry for matsuzaki.

180
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:07,045
Hisako-san's not working?

181
00:15:07,295 --> 00:15:09,624
That's right... she didn't return my calls.

182
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:15,030
Mr. Matsuzaki is gone.
Women today don't have any sense of duty.

183
00:15:15,374 --> 00:15:17,459
Maybe she was kidnapped?

184
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,905
No way.
She's changed the bar I guess.

185
00:15:22,753 --> 00:15:25,105
Where's her apartment?

186
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:29,753
Oh I haven't seen her these days.

187
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:30,605
From when?

188
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,729
She works at night so I didn't really understand.

189
00:15:37,925 --> 00:15:42,082
the phone is ringing.
Please do not enter the room.

190
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,346
You can tell by the number of newspapers how long she's been gone.

191
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,329
She hasn't been home for four days.

192
00:15:56,907 --> 00:16:03,149
It's been 10 days,
She hasn't been back since she dropped Mr. Matsuzaki off at the campsite on the night of the 9th.

193
00:16:04,469 --> 00:16:05,508
That's odd.

194
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:07,719
I'm sure it has something to do with Mr. Matsuzaki.

195
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,359
Is she Hisako?

196
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,336
I came here today to ask you something.

197
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:23,640
What is it?

198
00:16:25,171 --> 00:16:28,655
What was the purpose of Matsuzaki-san's business trip to Kansai?

199
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,765
I wouldn't send him on a business trip.
It was a vacation.

200
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,878
Mr. Matsuzaki told me he was going on a business trip.

201
00:16:38,347 --> 00:16:42,941
He must have been in a hurry to lie even to you.

202
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,183
What do you mean by that?

203
00:16:45,261 --> 00:16:50,542
It's hard for you to say.
Matsuzaki-kun was betraying our company.

204
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:51,940
What?

205
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,659
What the hell did he do?

206
00:16:55,073 --> 00:16:56,401
It's a diversion from the P-strike.

207
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,463
I investigated the collapse of the market price as a guide.

208
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:02,463
A lot of it was going to a cash-and-carry store in Nihonbashi.

209
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,463
Have a seat.

210
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,346
There's been a mistake.

211
00:17:06,979 --> 00:17:08,229
I trust him.

212
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:11,784
I wish I could say the same. But it's the truth.

213
00:17:13,229 --> 00:17:20,487
He may have done it in a moment of inattention.
But it could also be that he chose to die because it was about to come to light.

214
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:21,706
That's absurd.

215
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,440
I trust him.

216
00:17:24,885 --> 00:17:28,776
The president covered up MATSUZAKI's breach of trust.

217
00:17:29,846 --> 00:17:31,971
It should've been public knowledge.

218
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,081
Who are you?

219
00:17:34,346 --> 00:17:37,409
Excuse me.
This is Tsugawa, our new sales manager.

220
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,377
He's MATSUZAKI's successor, a man who worked for me a long time ago.

221
00:17:43,204 --> 00:17:44,938
Please take care of him.

222
00:17:46,344 --> 00:17:50,352
I didn't think he would do something like that.

223
00:17:51,329 --> 00:17:54,969
I really can't believe what he did.

224
00:17:56,094 --> 00:17:57,665
I trust him.

225
00:17:59,524 --> 00:18:00,563
There must be some mistake.

226
00:18:07,158 --> 00:18:10,635
Mr. Matsuzaki himself came to negotiate.

227
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:14,757
He offered a 40% discount on the sale price, so I jumped at it.

228
00:18:15,327 --> 00:18:20,101
but I was beaten up by my friends for breaking the price.
And Mr. Maruki gave me the stink-eye.

229
00:18:20,406 --> 00:18:22,702
I see.

230
00:18:26,498 --> 00:18:29,779
We are always happy to take care of your company's chemicals.

231
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:42,321
And you called me here to drink with you?
Stop drinking so much.

232
00:18:43,602 --> 00:18:44,696
it's not good for your health.

233
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,696
Who's her?

234
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,751
She's my Idol.

235
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:52,532
Let's toast.

236
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:56,144
I'm leaving.

237
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,066
Bill please.

238
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:02,937
30000yen.

239
00:19:06,015 --> 00:19:07,343
OK 30000yen.

240
00:19:11,046 --> 00:19:12,421
It's not enough.

241
00:19:12,608 --> 00:19:13,538
Keep the change.

242
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,967
Hey, asshole, don't underestimate me!

243
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,077
Wait.

244
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:24,085
This is how it was when I got to know Mr. Matsuzaki.

245
00:19:25,335 --> 00:19:30,202
I was the good face of the yakuza.
I was running a violent bar with my ill-gotten gains.

246
00:19:31,147 --> 00:19:33,569
30000yen. not 5000yen.

247
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,233
Understand?

248
00:19:35,655 --> 00:19:38,655
5000 yen is enough for 3 cocktails and 1 beer.

249
00:19:39,084 --> 00:19:40,240
You bastard!

250
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:42,647
Damn it.

251
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:45,522
That's enough

252
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,050
Our cocktails, you see, are a specialty.

253
00:19:53,972 --> 00:19:54,902
You'd better pay.

254
00:19:55,605 --> 00:19:59,566
I'm a pharmaceutical guy.
I want to take this red cocktail home and analyze it.

255
00:19:59,972 --> 00:20:01,988
You're a stubborn one, aren't you?

256
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:04,316
This is not a normal bar.

257
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:10,261
Do you know the value of your hard-earned money?

258
00:20:10,574 --> 00:20:16,722
why do you go to a bar like this?
Shouldn't you just go straight home every day?

259
00:20:16,902 --> 00:20:18,019
My wife is dead.

260
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,738
But how I spend the money I worked for is none of your business.

261
00:20:22,652 --> 00:20:28,543
Do you know how much worse it is to take the money of those who work without working yourself?

262
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:29,855
Is that all you wanna say?

263
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,527
Anyone who doesn't understand isn't human.

264
00:20:33,832 --> 00:20:34,793
Damn it.

265
00:20:35,597 --> 00:20:36,363
Stop it.

266
00:20:37,886 --> 00:20:40,925
You're a strange one, aren't you?

267
00:20:41,269 --> 00:20:44,371
I'm not.
Your view of the world is distorted, that's all.

268
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,433
Go to a cheaper bar.

269
00:20:48,941 --> 00:20:50,816
I'll pay you.

270
00:20:51,144 --> 00:20:52,707
I'm sorry for being violent towards you.This is the fee.

271
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:58,692
Come back when you're ready.
I'll charge you as much as a strip bar.

272
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:09,398
Mr. Matsuzaki came the next day, too.

273
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:15,558
He told me in order like he would tell his own son.He always told me to live right.

274
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,222
He changed my life.

275
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,152
I didn't know you were YAKUZA.

276
00:21:24,972 --> 00:21:26,035
I'm not trying to make excuses.

277
00:21:27,504 --> 00:21:32,457
When I was ten years old, there was a terrible air raid.
I lost my parents and my brothers and sisters all at once.

278
00:21:34,277 --> 00:21:38,887
From the next day I had to fend for myself.

279
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,378
The only thing you can do for a kid is match him for shoes or sell newspapers.
Of course. There was no way I could make a living doing that.

280
00:21:47,277 --> 00:21:50,214
Before I knew it, I was on the wrong path.

281
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:53,902
Matsuzaki-san... It's as if he was your god.

282
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:59,238
Yes, Mr. Matsuzaki is a god to me.

283
00:22:02,282 --> 00:22:03,993
He's guilty of betrayal.

284
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,353
He didn't commit suicide.

285
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,032
Mr. Matsuzaki must have been killed.

286
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:13,001
But who killed him and why?

287
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:13,829
I don't know.

288
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:18,540
But I'll find out.
By any means necessary.

289
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:23,149
The person Mr. Matsuzaki wanted you to meet... I wonder who.

290
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:25,868
Probably someone connected to our business.

291
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:31,329
I'm sure they'll get back to us.

292
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,444
Are you Mr. Hattori of IZUMI Chemicals?

293
00:22:55,522 --> 00:22:56,866
We'd like to take that bag.

294
00:22:58,316 --> 00:23:02,574
Think about it.
Your bag is important, but your body is more important.

295
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:04,699
Don't act like that.

296
00:23:06,002 --> 00:23:11,080
We don't ask for free money.
We will pay you what's in it and the equivalent amount.

297
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,467
Boss, we haven't received any orders from Maruki recently.

298
00:23:24,834 --> 00:23:27,381
They've been so busy that they haven't decided on a new company policy.

299
00:23:28,743 --> 00:23:30,782
I wanna a tea.

300
00:23:31,766 --> 00:23:36,235
Maybe the terms of the deal went bad after Mr. Matsuzaki's death.

301
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:39,279
let's say that's not the case
There's a new drug for HATTORI.

302
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:43,505
I'm looking forward to it.
All the big companies will be coming to buy it.

303
00:23:44,776 --> 00:23:48,877
As long as we have a sales network, we can be promoted from a subcontractor too.

304
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:53,932
It's a new drug that's sure to revolutionize the medical community.

305
00:23:54,706 --> 00:23:58,721
If we could invent something like this in other industries, we could become a major manufacturer in a single change.

306
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,260
we shouldn't be greedy.

307
00:24:01,198 --> 00:24:05,377
Sell the new drug through Maruki's sales network.
That's all right.

308
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,743
What if another company can offer better conditions than Maruki?

309
00:24:09,094 --> 00:24:11,516
Izumi Chemical has come this far thanks to Maruki.

310
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:14,227
We mustn't forget that.

311
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:16,555
It's thanks to Mr. Matsuzaki.

312
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:18,763
And now Mr. Matsuzaki is gone.

313
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:23,646
Yoshino Pharmaceutical Company is Maruki's rival company.

314
00:24:25,649 --> 00:24:26,329
Yoshino.

315
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:37,257
What's wrong?

316
00:24:39,022 --> 00:24:40,030
What's wrong with the bag?

317
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:43,647
I was just leaving the college gate when Someone took my bag.

318
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:45,725
Someone took?

319
00:24:46,358 --> 00:24:46,874
Bag?

320
00:24:47,046 --> 00:24:47,936
What are you gonna do?

321
00:24:48,444 --> 00:24:49,069
We'll be fine.

322
00:24:49,733 --> 00:24:51,296
Everything we need is in here.

323
00:24:53,009 --> 00:24:55,392
Don't be afraid... you're shortening my life span.

324
00:24:56,814 --> 00:24:58,923
Take a cab next time!

325
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:16,023
Here is a table of analysis of new drug data from each company

326
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:27,655
I want results from the institute.

327
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:28,475
I get it.

328
00:25:28,913 --> 00:25:31,233
I haven't heard anything on Maruki since then.

329
00:25:32,561 --> 00:25:36,264
There doesn't seem to be any significant activity, so I have no idea what's going on.

330
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:40,895
You should be more careful.
How are sales of new drugs?

331
00:25:41,966 --> 00:25:46,325
Sales have increased by more than 10% due to the effect of TV commercials.

332
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:48,974
You have a visitor from Izumi pharmaceutical.

333
00:25:49,435 --> 00:25:51,278
Ok get him here.

334
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,231
You guys leave.

335
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:14,045
You're finally here.
I've been waiting for you to come.

336
00:26:16,444 --> 00:26:18,644
I'm Izumida.
Nice to meet you.

337
00:26:20,553 --> 00:26:23,459
Please, have a seat.

338
00:26:25,163 --> 00:26:27,697
We met at the funeral.

339
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:34,644
How did you know Mr. Matsuzaki?

340
00:26:35,076 --> 00:26:38,576
Is it so strange that I went to his funeral?

341
00:26:40,479 --> 00:26:45,192
You said you were expecting me.
How did you know I was coming?

342
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,573
I just had a hunch.

343
00:26:50,086 --> 00:26:51,086
Don't make fun of me.

344
00:26:52,432 --> 00:26:56,485
By the way, it's unthinkable that Mr. Matsuzaki would kill himself.

345
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,669
That's what I thought too, that's why I came here.

346
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:05,672
You sound as if you think I killed Mr. Matsuzaki.

347
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:10,771
Before Mr. Matsuzaki died, he said he had someone he wanted me to meet.

348
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,730
By any chance..

349
00:27:14,156 --> 00:27:14,849
Me?

350
00:27:15,713 --> 00:27:19,353
I can't say but If you know something, I'd like to hear it.

351
00:27:21,535 --> 00:27:24,895
When you ask someone for something, you have to create a little more of a mood before you ask.

352
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:29,772
I'm not in the mood for that.
I'm a poor man with no spare time.

353
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:34,038
You make it sound like I'm the one with all the free time in the world.

354
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,998
I know you are busy too.

355
00:27:38,712 --> 00:27:42,652
Anyway, I'm sure you know more about Mr. Matsuzaki than I do.

356
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:45,365
I see.

357
00:27:47,146 --> 00:27:48,926
Then there's nothing more I can tell you.

358
00:27:52,166 --> 00:27:52,886
Wait.

359
00:27:55,966 --> 00:27:57,459
You have a short temper.

360
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,926
I forgot to ask you one more thing.

361
00:28:02,831 --> 00:28:07,064
Do you have any idea who targeted our HATTORI bags?

362
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,770
Who's Hattori?

363
00:28:13,489 --> 00:28:14,189
Sorry to bother you.

364
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:21,399
I've decided to withdraw the merger proposal.

365
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:26,284
Matsuzaki said he wanted to take care of IZUMI PHARMACEUTICALS as an independent subcontractor.

366
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,341
I can't go against the will of Buddha.

367
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,668
I'm relieved to hear that.

368
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:34,761
It hurts worse than being dumped by the woman I fell in love with.

369
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:42,673
Izumida.
I want you and your new drug in production right away.

370
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:44,645
That's not possible yet.

371
00:28:45,122 --> 00:28:48,042
We've barely finished animal testing and we're about to start clinical trials.

372
00:28:49,114 --> 00:28:52,301
It's just a matter of getting the data together and applying for government approval.

373
00:28:53,047 --> 00:28:56,627
I'll handle the backstabbing.
Anyway, I'd like you to start production.

374
00:28:57,607 --> 00:28:59,181
I'll give you all the money you need.

375
00:28:59,867 --> 00:29:03,927
Mr. President, back channels have no place in the manufacture and sale of a new drug.

376
00:29:04,688 --> 00:29:05,615
New drugs are a matter of life and death.

377
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,120
You don't have to know anything about drugs.
You know that at least.

378
00:29:10,517 --> 00:29:12,777
You're rude.

379
00:29:12,952 --> 00:29:14,172
I know.

380
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:16,738
I'm saying that because of the production.

381
00:29:17,065 --> 00:29:19,118
That's impossible.

382
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:23,918
Izumida, I heard you met Yoshino's female president.

383
00:29:25,322 --> 00:29:26,935
Don't be so surprised.

384
00:29:29,262 --> 00:29:31,622
I won't bring a new drug to Yoshino.

385
00:29:32,675 --> 00:29:36,515
I'm indebted to Mr. Maruki.
I'm sorry for your loss, Mr. Matsuzaki.

386
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:38,747
I believe you.

387
00:29:39,913 --> 00:29:43,627
If you feel that strongly about it...
I suggest you take me up on my offer.

388
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,813
Why you are so in hurry?

389
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:51,153
In order to rebuild MARUKI, we must first gain public attention and trust.

390
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:55,105
The only way to do that is with a new antibiotic drug.

391
00:29:57,785 --> 00:30:01,359
Our boss is asking you to do it.
Say yes.

392
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:03,325
No, sir.

393
00:30:04,255 --> 00:30:06,702
 If I'm not careful, I could jeopardize the new drug.

394
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:11,020
I think we should treat each other with more respect.

395
00:30:13,033 --> 00:30:14,799
Bring the booze.

396
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:21,799
We, the subcontractors, are controlled by the parent company.

397
00:30:22,514 --> 00:30:24,100
I hope they don't anything bad on us.

398
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:28,339
But it's impossible to make.

399
00:30:29,019 --> 00:30:31,219
Don't get so excited.
I've already said no.

400
00:30:34,446 --> 00:30:35,599
Hi,IZUMI Pharmaceuticals

401
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:38,046
Yes he's here.

402
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,113
It's from the Maruki sales manager.

403
00:30:43,492 --> 00:30:45,865
This is Izumida. Thank you for your help last night.

404
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,900
Add 100,000 dozen capsules of vitamins?

405
00:30:51,728 --> 00:30:53,714
But you're told sales of those are flat?

406
00:30:55,035 --> 00:30:57,615
Ok We'll manage it.

407
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:01,303
As you listened,Get us the materials.

408
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,049
I'm afraid we're overproducing capsules.

409
00:31:04,459 --> 00:31:08,346
I just turned down President's request.
I can't turn down this order.

410
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:12,199
Who's the boss?

411
00:31:12,746 --> 00:31:13,326
Me.

412
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:16,185
I'm here to pick you up.

413
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:17,266
Me?

414
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:24,241
Come in.
I know you want to hear something from me.

415
00:31:24,753 --> 00:31:26,900
We can talk here.

416
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:35,709
You said you don't think Matsuzaki-san committed suicide.

417
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:36,269
Yes.

418
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:37,716
Why do you think so?

419
00:31:45,443 --> 00:31:50,297
I had guided him to the cliff where Mr. Matsuzaki died.

420
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,227
What?

421
00:31:54,948 --> 00:31:56,281
It was long ago.

422
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:00,509
We went there together a couple of times.

423
00:32:01,062 --> 00:32:01,696
What for?

424
00:32:02,134 --> 00:32:05,348
I showed him the mountains.
He can get soil fungus like a roar.

425
00:32:05,826 --> 00:32:09,360
So soil fungus is my company's new drug's?

426
00:32:10,852 --> 00:32:14,298
Yes, I discovered it and bought the rights to the mountain.

427
00:32:15,022 --> 00:32:18,515
And I don't even have to cultivate it.
It's worth it on a commercial basis.

428
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:22,041
There were the prospect of mass production.

429
00:32:24,726 --> 00:32:29,919
If you're willing to let me sell the new drug to you.
I'd be happy to supply you with the soil fungus.

430
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:39,166
And now that Matsuzaki-san is gone.
You don't have to be obliging to Maruki, do you?

431
00:32:40,036 --> 00:32:41,923
Mr. Matsuzaki had half a mind to do it.

432
00:32:45,068 --> 00:32:49,021
Mr. Matsuzaki has not told me anything.

433
00:32:49,723 --> 00:32:52,296
He worked for Maruki so.

434
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:55,750
But he had finally made up your mind.

435
00:32:56,777 --> 00:32:57,637
Can you prove it?

436
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:01,757
Mr. Matsuzaki called me the day before he left.

437
00:33:02,263 --> 00:33:05,323
He said We'll discuss it together when I get back.

438
00:33:06,791 --> 00:33:10,884
You are the one who Matsuzaki said.

439
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:13,230
Yeah, we should work together.

440
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:15,024
Mr. Matsuzaki had a mind to do it too.

441
00:33:19,075 --> 00:33:23,529
I have a good opinion of you.
I'm willing to help in any way I can.

442
00:33:25,988 --> 00:33:28,481
I don't like to accept help from women.

443
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:33,476
Women are only for marriage or fun.

444
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:42,385
I'm willing to be your plaything, but only for tonight.

445
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:51,759
We'll talk about the new drug after we find out who killed Mr. Matsuzaki.

446
00:33:52,939 --> 00:33:55,159
There's still some trick up.

447
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:03,023
Where is the item?

448
00:34:06,688 --> 00:34:08,035
I gave you.

449
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:10,818
P-strike.

450
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:13,687
Matsuzaki of MARUKI brought this to my attention.

451
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,086
What the hell is your connection to Mr. Matsuzaki?

452
00:34:16,913 --> 00:34:23,360
I saved his life.
But now Matsuzaki is dead and I can't get my share.

453
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,370
I already paid.

454
00:34:25,513 --> 00:34:28,053
Don't be lying.
Matsuzaki didn't get paid.

455
00:34:29,113 --> 00:34:30,347
Are you here to blackmail me?

456
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:34,004
I'm here to get paid.

457
00:34:34,451 --> 00:34:35,304
Don't be lying.

458
00:34:35,822 --> 00:34:37,335
Matsuzaki didn't bring P-strike.

459
00:34:38,097 --> 00:34:39,463
If you don't leave quickly, I'll call the police.

460
00:34:41,998 --> 00:34:43,751
Tell me who brought?

461
00:34:44,752 --> 00:34:49,159
Are you involved in the murder of Mr. Matsuzaki?

462
00:34:50,926 --> 00:34:54,252
Dad, what did you buy?

463
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:57,067
Electric Car for you.

464
00:34:57,167 --> 00:34:59,054
What's mine?

465
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,215
Let's open at house.

466
00:35:02,837 --> 00:35:04,503
I can't wait.

467
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:08,072
What's mine?

468
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,526
You are heavy.

469
00:35:10,963 --> 00:35:12,023
I can't wait.

470
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:18,072
I need to talk to you.

471
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:21,723
You guys go home first.

472
00:35:22,058 --> 00:35:24,824
I need to talk to him.

473
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:27,597
Let's go.

474
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:34,789
You were the one who diverted the P-strike, weren't you?

475
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,967
What?
I can't believe you're saying this.

476
00:35:38,601 --> 00:35:40,927
The wholesaler's owner spoke out.

477
00:35:42,593 --> 00:35:45,147
So it was you who framed Mr. Matsuzaki?

478
00:35:46,313 --> 00:35:47,593
Don't make false accusations.

479
00:35:50,268 --> 00:35:53,354
You set it up so that Mr. Matsuzaki would commit suicide after he was found out to be P-strike.

480
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:57,354
You'd better tell me the truth or things will get worse.

481
00:36:00,148 --> 00:36:01,281
Did the boss ask you to do it?

482
00:36:02,481 --> 00:36:04,101
No, that's not true.

483
00:36:08,263 --> 00:36:09,383
I did it on my own.

484
00:36:10,203 --> 00:36:12,656
I know You can't do it.

485
00:36:15,187 --> 00:36:20,480
I don't need to hear it directly from you.
I think I'm starting to get the general idea.

486
00:36:23,089 --> 00:36:23,656
Tsugawa

487
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:29,668
I'm leaving quietly for the sake of your beautiful children.

488
00:36:42,621 --> 00:36:43,761
There was a house breaker?

489
00:36:45,755 --> 00:36:46,928
I'm sorry.

490
00:36:47,252 --> 00:36:48,378
It's my fault.

491
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:51,716
I'm the one who encouraged you to stay up late drinking.

492
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:55,990
I said we could have a drink in my office.
I got really drunk and fell asleep, I don't remember.

493
00:37:01,921 --> 00:37:06,928
I don't think we'll have to worry about that.
Get back work.

494
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:13,508
Stolen data is no big deal.

495
00:37:13,961 --> 00:37:14,695
Why?

496
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:17,151
Real data is here.

497
00:37:25,636 --> 00:37:26,522
Here it is.

498
00:37:27,852 --> 00:37:29,299
We'll be fine.

499
00:37:29,605 --> 00:37:31,945
You're great.

500
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:38,392
Sir, there's a phone call for you.

501
00:37:39,695 --> 00:37:40,702
Please answer for me.

502
00:37:41,289 --> 00:37:44,462
It's a woman. She needs to talk to you.

503
00:37:54,085 --> 00:37:56,411
Hello. This is Mr. Izumida.
who?

504
00:37:58,124 --> 00:38:00,431
Hisako?
Where have you been?

505
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,670
Mr. Matsuzaki told me to hide myself if anything should happen to him.

506
00:38:05,351 --> 00:38:08,824
I'm being targeted right now.
I don't know who it is, but I'm sure.

507
00:38:10,118 --> 00:38:12,545
Please come help me.

508
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:17,084
I'm hiding in a car in the Nitto parking lot.

509
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:24,875
It's a Crown, black, parked in G-21, basement level 2.
Black Crown, license plate 1676.

510
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:26,365
Ok I'll get there soon.

511
00:38:26,983 --> 00:38:27,983
I'm going.

512
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:26,259
Your head was stony, the doctor said.

513
00:39:27,352 --> 00:39:30,899
The doctor said if you'd had a normal head, you'd have had a skull cavity or something.

514
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:35,488
Somebody didn't want me around, so they did it.

515
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:40,473
The police checked the license plate, and it turned out to be a forgery.

516
00:39:41,991 --> 00:39:45,155
As expected, Maruki, the company's manager Tsugawa is the suspect?

517
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:48,069
He's nothing but just a slave for Kakunuma.

518
00:39:49,961 --> 00:39:51,586
I need to investigate him just in case.

519
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,640
There's something I can do?

520
00:39:57,898 --> 00:40:02,218
I'll have you check around Tsugawa and Kakunuma.

521
00:40:02,812 --> 00:40:03,648
And shoes.

522
00:40:04,484 --> 00:40:04,961
Shoes?

523
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:09,398
They're an odd pair of black and white shoes.
When I got hit and fell down, I caught a glimpse of it.

524
00:40:11,722 --> 00:40:13,362
The voice on the phone was really HISAKO's.

525
00:40:14,261 --> 00:40:15,636
I'm pretty sure that voice is HISAKO's.

526
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:19,550
Anyway, she's the key.

527
00:40:20,706 --> 00:40:24,878
But she could have been killed by now.

528
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,372
It's been ages.

529
00:40:43,348 --> 00:40:44,075
Where's Director Tsugawa?

530
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:44,864
He's not here.

531
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,723
I'd like to see him.

532
00:40:47,051 --> 00:40:49,270
He suddenly went on a business trip.

533
00:40:49,747 --> 00:40:52,778
He left without telling me where he was going.
Why don't you have a seat?

534
00:40:56,529 --> 00:40:59,037
He's on the run because of an article he put in our paper.

535
00:40:59,154 --> 00:41:02,373
But thanks to you, I'll be able to relax.
Why don't you go ahead and take your time?

536
00:41:10,057 --> 00:41:12,151
You must miss your old workplace.

537
00:41:12,807 --> 00:41:13,080
Yeah.

538
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:19,911
Let me ask you, TSUGAWA have unusual black and white shoes?

539
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:23,232
He always seems to wear black shoes.
What's wrong?

540
00:41:26,589 --> 00:41:27,589
Where's Kakunuma?

541
00:41:28,003 --> 00:41:29,292
He just left.

542
00:41:30,565 --> 00:41:34,807
Sorry I made you wait.
The first step for a new drug is a success.

543
00:41:35,003 --> 00:41:37,417
But what do you think Izumi Pharmaceutical Company will do?

544
00:41:38,143 --> 00:41:40,307
I will force them to cooperate.

545
00:41:40,945 --> 00:41:42,774
We’re already ready.

546
00:41:43,133 --> 00:41:45,102
How about yours?

547
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,227
In any case, we are making an effort because there are great interests involved.

548
00:41:49,164 --> 00:41:51,563
We are the reseller.

549
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:54,734
When will the decision be made?

550
00:41:55,531 --> 00:42:00,945
I can't keep it up for much longer. Well, a few more weeks is the best I can do.

551
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,095
If we don't have the money by then, we'll fall behind.

552
00:42:06,564 --> 00:42:10,330
Ok let's do it.
You take care of the legal issues.

553
00:42:10,572 --> 00:42:14,463
I'm hungry. Let's order some food.

554
00:42:23,042 --> 00:42:27,315
The man in the president's seat at Maruki's... is that Mr. Kato?

555
00:42:27,862 --> 00:42:30,683
No.
They are Mr. Akazawa and Mr. Inoue.

556
00:42:31,073 --> 00:42:33,104
Oh I see.
Thank you very much.

557
00:42:44,248 --> 00:42:47,248
Inoue-san's his secretary.
Raitaro Inuzuka.

558
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,241
Inuzuka, that political mastermind?

559
00:42:50,631 --> 00:42:54,061
I showed him the CEO's office once at work.

560
00:42:55,952 --> 00:42:57,038
Coffee.

561
00:42:58,845 --> 00:43:00,361
Did you check out what I was talking about?

562
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,071
I felt like I was spying on him.

563
00:43:03,993 --> 00:43:08,118
Is it true that Mr. Matsuzaki's death had something to do with the company's internal affairs?

564
00:43:09,243 --> 00:43:10,251
Yeah.

565
00:43:11,876 --> 00:43:12,572
So tell me.

566
00:43:14,587 --> 00:43:19,072
I'm not sure but
He's been holding back on his shipments and collecting a lot of cash.

567
00:43:20,535 --> 00:43:24,418
He's de-stocked his warehouse, and he's got a bank loan.

568
00:43:26,184 --> 00:43:31,270
He's supposed to be investing in equipment and beefing up sales.
He hasn't touched anything.

569
00:43:33,682 --> 00:43:34,564
That's strange.

570
00:43:37,885 --> 00:43:40,814
But thank you.
Do you want something to eat?

571
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:43,533
No, thank you.
Let's split the bill.

572
00:43:44,143 --> 00:43:47,150
I feel like I'm being bought out.

573
00:44:00,847 --> 00:44:02,159
I'm retracting this article.

574
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:06,722
If you don't cut ties with Maruki while you still can, you won't be able to retract it.

575
00:44:07,823 --> 00:44:11,738
Or are you confident you can get it out in time for next week's launch?

576
00:44:12,808 --> 00:44:14,503
I don't think I have to answer to you.

577
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:16,550
There's no way they'll get it out in time.

578
00:44:17,503 --> 00:44:19,745
And the new drug is losing all credibility.

579
00:44:20,847 --> 00:44:23,308
Even Izumi Pharmaceutical may go bankrupt.

580
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:28,972
I can't let the company go bankrupt.

581
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:33,159
The people who work at our company are the kind of people the world doesn't accept.

582
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:35,159
They need us.

583
00:44:39,478 --> 00:44:43,923
Then why not even more so?
I'll take full responsibility for this.

584
00:44:45,126 --> 00:44:48,072
I told you we'd discuss it after I've done with Mr. Matsuzaki case.

585
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,494
I don't care if it's too late.

586
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:53,189
Our new drug was made possible thanks to Mr. Matsuzaki.

587
00:44:54,072 --> 00:44:56,361
I'm not willing to make a deal before I know who did it.

588
00:44:56,783 --> 00:44:59,322
You're surprisingly stubborn.

589
00:45:00,241 --> 00:45:01,256
And there's another reason.

590
00:45:02,765 --> 00:45:04,913
Hattori was attacked the other day, and his lab was broken into.

591
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,890
It's possible you gave the order.

592
00:45:08,093 --> 00:45:12,046
Don't be silly.
I'm making an honest offer.

593
00:45:13,590 --> 00:45:18,817
Maruki didn't beat you up and put you in the hospital
And then he announced the launch of a new drug.

594
00:45:19,834 --> 00:45:20,803
It could be.

595
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,795
The point is, I don't trust you people at all.

596
00:45:26,835 --> 00:45:29,241
I can't take a rest.

597
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:35,139
Where the CEOs of big companies sleep for a month.
I get up and go to work in a day.

598
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:40,147
Assuming it goes on sale next week, as Maruki announced.
I'm sure you'll have the data from the clinical trials.

599
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:42,046
We're not at that stage yet.

600
00:45:42,350 --> 00:45:44,874
That's weird.
You don't even have production data?

601
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:47,811
The clinical trials were done at Kanto University, right?

602
00:45:48,163 --> 00:45:51,108
Why haven't you launched your groundbreaking new drug yet?

603
00:45:52,296 --> 00:45:55,499
We haven't even applied for a manufacturing license yet.

604
00:45:56,678 --> 00:45:58,436
I cannot take responsibility for Mr. Kakunuma's statements.

605
00:45:59,038 --> 00:46:01,842
President Kakunuma's mouth was quite willing to go on.

606
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,374
Are you willing to offend Maruki?

607
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:05,350
Are your new drug announcements a lie?

608
00:46:05,375 --> 00:46:06,686
You will lose Maruki's trust.

609
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:10,124
Stop it.
The president is in the hospital.

610
00:46:23,492 --> 00:46:25,758
Welcome back.

611
00:46:27,477 --> 00:46:28,711
Welcome back.

612
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,008
Is everything all right,?

613
00:46:30,163 --> 00:46:30,922
Are you alright?

614
00:46:30,947 --> 00:46:32,164
I got out of the hospital on my own.

615
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,125
You guys met with newspaper reporters, right?

616
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:36,406
Did you read the newspaper?

617
00:46:36,781 --> 00:46:38,899
Yoshino's boss came to the hospital and showed it to me.

618
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,860
She's too nice.

619
00:46:41,781 --> 00:46:43,406
Are you alright?

620
00:46:44,078 --> 00:46:44,781
So so.

621
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:47,031
Yoshida,give me painkillers.

622
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:51,099
They don't give a shit about my body.

623
00:46:51,974 --> 00:46:53,052
How was the newspaper reporters?

624
00:46:53,193 --> 00:46:56,224
They are pushy.
Maruki's president sent him.

625
00:46:56,802 --> 00:46:57,498
What did you tell?

626
00:46:58,013 --> 00:46:59,888
I denied everything Maruki said.

627
00:47:00,583 --> 00:47:02,177
I hope it doesn't become a problem later.

628
00:47:02,623 --> 00:47:04,552
I told the truth.

629
00:47:06,091 --> 00:47:09,521
If I admit to making the announcement, we'll have to start production tomorrow.
That's impossible.

630
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:13,544
That's all right.
No one will blame you.

631
00:47:14,654 --> 00:47:15,607
Thanks.

632
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,248
Welcome back.

633
00:47:21,068 --> 00:47:24,709
I worry what Maruki will act.

634
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:29,599
Don't worry.
We have new drugs.

635
00:47:30,115 --> 00:47:30,841
We'll win.

636
00:47:32,443 --> 00:47:35,841
I strongly suspect that Maruki's boss, Kakunuma, killed Matsuzaki-san.

637
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:39,635
Why did he kill him?
I'm sure it has something to do with the new drug.

638
00:47:39,955 --> 00:47:41,471
Big news!

639
00:47:41,752 --> 00:47:42,228
What?

640
00:47:42,424 --> 00:47:44,861
Maruki won't take back 100,000 dozen capsules.

641
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:45,838
What?

642
00:47:46,349 --> 00:47:48,404
Sales of vitamins in general have hit a plateau.

643
00:47:49,115 --> 00:47:51,552
So we're going to have to cut back on production and switch to other products.

644
00:47:52,381 --> 00:47:53,076
It can't be helped.

645
00:47:53,701 --> 00:47:58,482
I told you.
The production value of vitamins is nothing new.

646
00:47:59,326 --> 00:48:02,084
You're gonna make us make it, and don't take it back, we're gonna go bankrupt.

647
00:48:02,959 --> 00:48:06,240
I wasn't optimistic enough.

648
00:48:06,435 --> 00:48:07,998
Anyway, We made it to your order.

649
00:48:08,724 --> 00:48:09,521
Please pay.

650
00:48:09,881 --> 00:48:12,865
I can't pay for goods that are no longer needed.

651
00:48:13,506 --> 00:48:17,482
The subcontractor will go bankrupt if they do.
Not this time, I don't agree.

652
00:48:18,041 --> 00:48:21,533
Up to you.
We have many subcontractors.

653
00:48:22,064 --> 00:48:26,845
I see.
What happened to the responsibility of dodging the P-strike diversion to Mr. Matsuzaki?

654
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:30,377
It was the wholesaler's mistake.

655
00:48:31,025 --> 00:48:32,212
It's not TSUGAWA's fault either.

656
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:34,705
I'm sorry for Matsuzaki.

657
00:48:35,923 --> 00:48:37,447
Is it just a matter of misunderstanding?

658
00:48:38,572 --> 00:48:39,939
That won't help Mr. Matsuzaki, will it?

659
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,541
I'm sorry .

660
00:48:41,822 --> 00:48:44,564
I've been very busy and I don't know anything about medicine.

661
00:48:46,033 --> 00:48:51,712
By the way, I'm willing to pay for the damage to the capsule.
I'd like to see some sincerity on your part.

662
00:48:53,377 --> 00:48:55,604
I've always been sincere with you, Mr. Maruki.

663
00:48:56,432 --> 00:49:01,252
What does it mean to say that your employees denied my announcement in its entirety?

664
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:04,508
That made it difficult for me to control newspaper articles.

665
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:08,000
Because you made a rash announcement without consulting me.

666
00:49:08,718 --> 00:49:10,703
While I was in the hospital for a beating.

667
00:49:11,226 --> 00:49:12,976
I'm very sorry you got hurt.

668
00:49:14,027 --> 00:49:17,723
It's ridiculous to think that a subcontractor is dragging its parent company down.

669
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,324
Back to the story before.

670
00:49:21,973 --> 00:49:26,637
If Mr. Matsuzaki's diversion of P-strikes is innocent.
I've lost the reason for Mr. Matsuzaki's suicide.

671
00:49:27,012 --> 00:49:30,598
It is a favor to the president to offer to bear the damage.

672
00:49:31,496 --> 00:49:35,098
You'd be wise to go along with the president's policy on new drugs.

673
00:49:35,637 --> 00:49:37,441
Either way, IZUMI Chemicals is a dead end

674
00:49:39,801 --> 00:49:44,191
But we will survive at any cost.

675
00:49:49,048 --> 00:49:52,673
Since I came all the way from Kansai, I can't go home without doing some work.

676
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,817
We'll pay you for the dishonored portion sooner or later, I promise.

677
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:00,442
Please leave today.

678
00:50:00,895 --> 00:50:05,911
I can't.
Please do something anyway.

679
00:50:12,724 --> 00:50:13,474
Terajima.

680
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,966
In the meantime, we'll have to arrange to unload the stock at a fraction of the cost.

681
00:50:18,826 --> 00:50:21,982
But if you do that, it'll hurt our order.

682
00:50:22,007 --> 00:50:23,162
No choice.

683
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,201
We're paying you.

684
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:29,404
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

685
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:33,467
Is it true? Then I'll come back tomorrow.

686
00:50:37,052 --> 00:50:40,997
Why don't we take this opportunity to get away from MARUKI?

687
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:42,732
Wait a while.

688
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:44,888
I have an idea.

689
00:50:45,724 --> 00:50:46,724
What are you going to do?

690
00:50:49,927 --> 00:50:52,810
We'd like to hear.

691
00:50:58,585 --> 00:51:03,562
The issue of the new drug will have to wait until we find out who killed Mr. Matsuzaki.

692
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,570
That's different from this.

693
00:51:06,554 --> 00:51:09,398
The new drug is a bait to attract the murderer.

694
00:51:10,281 --> 00:51:11,046
Bait?

695
00:51:11,749 --> 00:51:14,288
Mr. Matsuzaki was murdered because of the new drug problem.

696
00:51:15,171 --> 00:51:17,562
That's why we need a new drug to uncover the identity of the culprit.

697
00:51:17,788 --> 00:51:20,420
Are you going to use the new drug as a tool to find the culprit?

698
00:51:21,234 --> 00:51:21,757
What?

699
00:51:22,124 --> 00:51:24,835
Do you really care what happens to the credibility of the new drug as long as the culprit is caught?

700
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,109
That's not what I'm saying.

701
00:51:26,343 --> 00:51:28,436
It's the police's job to find the murderer.

702
00:51:30,218 --> 00:51:33,429
Mr. Matsuzaki was worried about our new drug when he was about to be killed.

703
00:51:33,687 --> 00:51:36,734
But that doesn't mean we can't do our research in this condition.

704
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:41,265
This isn't a big company lab.

705
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:43,640
I don't know how you've made it this far with such guts.

706
00:51:43,665 --> 00:51:45,734
We've been through a lot, and we want to take good care of our new drug.

707
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:46,421
I know.

708
00:51:46,492 --> 00:51:50,210
You don't understand.
You're more interested in stale dead people than new drugs.

709
00:51:50,235 --> 00:51:50,874
Stupid.

710
00:51:51,023 --> 00:51:54,101
Say that again.

711
00:51:55,538 --> 00:51:58,531
Would you be okay with IZUMI PHARMACEUTICAL going out of business as long as it makes you feel better?

712
00:51:59,453 --> 00:52:01,984
Don't you care about the lives of the people who work here?

713
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:10,600
Hattori.

714
00:52:13,559 --> 00:52:16,434
Wait,Hattori.

715
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:20,629
He didn't mean that he hit you.

716
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:21,598
Where are you going?

717
00:52:21,926 --> 00:52:22,653
University Hospital.

718
00:52:23,481 --> 00:52:25,192
I'll drive you there.

719
00:52:25,731 --> 00:52:28,848
Who knows who'll come after your bag again?

720
00:52:30,442 --> 00:52:33,848
I just bought a new car, a little deluxe.

721
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:36,606
I'll bring the car around.

722
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:54,323
I'm gonna go call my wife.
I left her stomach pills on the dresser.

723
00:52:54,557 --> 00:52:56,159
I'm sure she's looking for them.

724
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:18,723
Mr. Hattori, you're just in time.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

725
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:23,566
The university's research facilities are public property.
Your research is for profit.

726
00:53:24,629 --> 00:53:31,480
The only reason we are cooperating with you when we would normally refuse is because I believe that your new drug has the potential to revolutionize the medical community.

727
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,300
I'm well aware of that.

728
00:53:33,894 --> 00:53:36,347
So I ask you, what the hell is Maruki' announcement?

729
00:53:37,206 --> 00:53:39,589
They're releasing a new drug next week, and it's insane.

730
00:53:40,581 --> 00:53:41,792
We no longer corporate with you.

731
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:46,808
Wait a minute.
If the university shuts us down, all our work will be nothing.

732
00:53:47,777 --> 00:53:50,995
Anyway, I can't be responsible for you anymore.
You can go home.

733
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,679
Excuse me.

734
00:54:26,312 --> 00:54:28,952
Are you Hattori of IZUMI CHEMICALS?

735
00:54:29,968 --> 00:54:30,593
Yes.

736
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:36,475
I'm the president of Yoshino Pharmaceuticals.
I have something to show you, and I won't take up too much of your time.

737
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:52,215
What do you think?

738
00:54:53,113 --> 00:54:54,230
Super great.

739
00:54:55,863 --> 00:54:57,980
Better than a college lab.

740
00:54:59,035 --> 00:55:03,066
It's my policy to invest 3% of the company's profits in this place.

741
00:55:04,230 --> 00:55:08,840
But for all that, we're wasting 100 million yen every year because we're not getting results.

742
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:18,738
Mr. Izumida, when he finds out that the university has been taken away from him, what kind of measures will he take?

743
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,629
He's more interested in finding the culprit than new drugs.

744
00:55:26,441 --> 00:55:30,238
He's a brilliant man, but his way of thinking is a little strange.

745
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:37,238
People today should be thinking about doing good research and making as much money as possible, instead of playing dumb.

746
00:55:38,911 --> 00:55:41,396
I don't know what to do anymore.

747
00:55:44,388 --> 00:55:45,794
You look tired.

748
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:50,146
Don't you think you should take a rest for a while?

749
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:58,860
Why don't you do it tomorrow?

750
00:55:59,868 --> 00:56:04,453
I'll have to look into tomorrow's collections.

751
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:06,759
I'm sorry.
I've put you through a lot of trouble.

752
00:56:07,274 --> 00:56:11,805
I hope we can hold out until the problem with the new drug is solved.

753
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:18,564
Hattori is late.
He's always home by the evening.

754
00:56:20,353 --> 00:56:23,947
I said too much during the day.
He's a small man.

755
00:56:26,283 --> 00:56:27,846
Hattori is late.

756
00:56:29,182 --> 00:56:30,260
I'll answer.

757
00:56:32,064 --> 00:56:33,049
Hello, IZUMI Pharmaceuticals.

758
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:35,783
Hattori... What's wrong?

759
00:56:36,853 --> 00:56:38,783
where are you?

760
00:56:41,409 --> 00:56:43,737
I need holidays for a few days.

761
00:56:44,456 --> 00:56:47,401
What?
Why don't you just tell me in person?

762
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:49,276
Hey, Hattori.

763
00:56:50,471 --> 00:56:53,190
I need to cool off.
Don't ask me anything now.

764
00:56:54,378 --> 00:56:55,073
I'm tired.

765
00:56:56,010 --> 00:57:01,244
Let's meet up and talk.
Come back soon. where are you?

766
00:57:03,395 --> 00:57:04,465
Hello,Hello.

767
00:57:12,171 --> 00:57:15,257
This is 961-8611.
Where did that call come from?

768
00:57:15,953 --> 00:57:17,328
Hold on.

769
00:57:18,421 --> 00:57:20,304
From Tokyuu dai.

770
00:57:21,226 --> 00:57:21,867
I see.

771
00:57:25,118 --> 00:57:26,141
What's with him all of a sudden?

772
00:57:26,758 --> 00:57:30,844
It's funny.
He's not a selfish man.

773
00:57:31,618 --> 00:57:36,094
Maybe he was forced..
He's involved in a new drug.

774
00:57:36,477 --> 00:57:37,696
He act strange.

775
00:57:38,454 --> 00:57:40,063
Someone must have kidnapped him.

776
00:57:42,662 --> 00:57:44,897
I'm sure Maruki's boss did it.

777
00:57:49,818 --> 00:57:52,154
What the hell are you doing here?

778
00:57:52,818 --> 00:57:54,216
You know why I'm here.

779
00:57:54,623 --> 00:57:56,841
Go home.
We are at work.

780
00:57:57,170 --> 00:58:01,537
Mr. Nakazawa, our legal counsel, and that's Mr. Inoue, if I'm not mistaken.

781
00:58:02,021 --> 00:58:03,482
You're rude.
Who are you?

782
00:58:03,607 --> 00:58:05,380
Come with me.

783
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:16,130
What can I do for you?

784
00:58:16,693 --> 00:58:17,896
Please give me back Hattori.

785
00:58:18,123 --> 00:58:19,834
What?
What happened to Hattori?

786
00:58:19,912 --> 00:58:23,185
You are the only one who can kidnap him.

787
00:58:23,443 --> 00:58:25,100
He was kidnapped?

788
00:58:26,521 --> 00:58:28,709
If anything should happen to Hattori... I’ll beat you.

789
00:58:28,896 --> 00:58:31,537
You think I'd do something like stomp out a new drug?

790
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:36,162
If it's true that he was abducted, then I'm the one who's not gonna shut up.
It's your fault.

791
00:58:37,021 --> 00:58:38,131
What did you do?

792
00:58:38,725 --> 00:58:42,514
Even if it's not a kidnapping, even if it's a disappearance, you're the cause of it.

793
00:58:43,373 --> 00:58:45,146
He's collateral damage from an insane production announcement.

794
00:58:45,639 --> 00:58:46,990
You still think I'm guilty?

795
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,959
Of course I do.
Or do you have proof that you don't?

796
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:55,053
OK.
I'll cancel the release announcement to prove my innocence.

797
00:58:55,279 --> 00:58:55,834
When?

798
00:58:56,584 --> 00:58:58,623
I'll get the press together at headquarters tomorrow.

799
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:03,725
If you really cancel the production announcement tomorrow. I'll believe you.

800
00:59:07,927 --> 00:59:08,482
Where's Madam?

801
00:59:08,872 --> 00:59:09,599
Upstairs.

802
00:59:10,076 --> 00:59:10,755
I see.

803
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:28,343
Who's that?

804
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:29,303
Mr. Tachibana.

805
00:59:29,984 --> 00:59:30,820
What's he doing?

806
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:32,343
YAKUZA, right?

807
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:34,414
He comes to see me sometimes at Madam.

808
00:59:50,631 --> 00:59:53,373
Is this Izumi Chemicals?
Terajima?

809
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,537
Is Izumida there?

810
00:59:57,014 --> 00:59:58,983
I promised him, but he hasn't come yet.

811
01:00:00,756 --> 01:00:02,248
Mr. Hattori is missing?

812
01:00:03,022 --> 01:00:04,287
I wonder what happened to him.

813
01:00:05,850 --> 01:00:10,561
Tell him to come over right away.

814
01:00:12,523 --> 01:00:13,359
Hold on.

815
01:00:30,925 --> 01:00:32,667
They drive too fast.

816
01:00:33,245 --> 01:00:34,425
Don't miss them.

817
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:04,686
Wait here.

818
01:01:04,983 --> 01:01:05,584
OK.

819
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,044
Let me ask you something.

820
01:01:54,771 --> 01:01:55,411
What is it?

821
01:01:55,957 --> 01:01:58,217
What are you two doing here?

822
01:01:58,629 --> 01:01:59,216
Visiting.

823
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:00,042
Who?

824
01:02:01,024 --> 01:02:03,504
If you need me, you can come back tomorrow.

825
01:02:03,579 --> 01:02:06,626
I need to see him.
It's important.

826
01:02:25,373 --> 01:02:27,400
Don't worry.
They are ok.

827
01:02:44,835 --> 01:02:46,128
You're HISAKO, right?

828
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:50,814
Why did she come here?

829
01:02:51,301 --> 01:02:52,587
She was brought here by the person who just came in.

830
01:02:53,507 --> 01:02:57,134
They say she's a relative.
They won't tell us what happened, so we don't know what to do.

831
01:03:06,683 --> 01:03:09,349
Do you remember Mr. Matsuzaki?

832
01:03:13,181 --> 01:03:14,381
She's delirious.

833
01:03:15,243 --> 01:03:16,589
She must have had a terrible shock.

834
01:03:18,917 --> 01:03:20,270
Will she get better?

835
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:27,642
I don't know.
She'll have to take our time to find out.

836
01:03:49,815 --> 01:03:50,855
Come with me.

837
01:03:59,828 --> 01:04:01,995
Driver!

838
01:04:02,462 --> 01:04:03,362
What’s wrong?

839
01:04:16,425 --> 01:04:21,599
I'm sorry to be leaving Maruki Pharmaceuticals.

840
01:04:22,396 --> 01:04:25,636
I was prepared to devote my entire life to this business.

841
01:04:26,828 --> 01:04:30,235
I also had faith.

842
01:04:31,385 --> 01:04:38,391
I announced the production of a breakthrough emerging material, one that I hoped would benefit society as soon as possible.

843
01:04:39,965 --> 01:04:42,298
But it was not yet the right time to announce it.

844
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:48,566
I was new to the pharmaceutical industry, and I was naive.

845
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,333
But now that I'm retracting the announcement, I can't make any excuses.

846
01:04:53,196 --> 01:05:00,569
To those of you who have taken an interest in this matter.
I take full responsibility for betraying the shareholders' cabinet.

847
01:05:01,023 --> 01:05:02,343
You're avoiding your responsibility by quitting.

848
01:05:02,526 --> 01:05:03,519
Did you lie about the new drug?

849
01:05:03,756 --> 01:05:06,269
If you're going to retire, you're going to have to solve the new drug problem.

850
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:14,398
I'm afraid there was insufficient communication with Izumi Pharmaceutical regarding the new drug.

851
01:05:15,395 --> 01:05:17,928
Ask Mr. Izumida here for details.

852
01:05:20,028 --> 01:05:21,988
That's not what I'm talking about.

853
01:05:22,446 --> 01:05:23,606
Say definitely.

854
01:05:23,772 --> 01:05:24,806
When is the new drug available?

855
01:05:24,912 --> 01:05:26,619
Tell us the truth.

856
01:05:27,213 --> 01:05:29,953
It's ready.
But it's going to take some time, so I won't announce it.

857
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:32,330
Why did you keep Maruki's announcement quiet?

858
01:05:32,381 --> 01:05:33,187
I didn't.

859
01:05:34,573 --> 01:05:36,326
They finally canceled it today.

860
01:05:36,579 --> 01:05:38,833
You and Kakunuma have been planning this and stalling until today, haven't you?

861
01:05:39,066 --> 01:05:40,013
Don't hide.

862
01:05:40,563 --> 01:05:40,997
That's outrageous!

863
01:05:41,022 --> 01:05:44,086
Show your data.
You are irresponsible.

864
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,902
Releasing the data would be like giving away the rights to a new drug.

865
01:06:03,950 --> 01:06:08,496
If a big company starts production, our facilities won't be able to keep up.

866
01:06:10,513 --> 01:06:12,733
The first one to release a new drug is the winner.

867
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:15,146
Kakunuma was running away.

868
01:06:16,176 --> 01:06:21,502
Maruki didn't care about the new drug itself.
They used Maruki's stock price as a bargaining chip.

869
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:26,254
Kakunuma dumped all his shares at the highest price he could find.

870
01:06:27,171 --> 01:06:28,877
He made hundreds of millions of yen.

871
01:06:29,916 --> 01:06:33,483
That was the plan from the moment he took over Maruki.

872
01:06:34,379 --> 01:06:38,206
Mr. Matsuzaki saw through their scheme and tried to sell our new drug to YOSHINO.

873
01:06:38,978 --> 01:06:41,178
If another company gets the new drug, their plan will be ruined.

874
01:06:42,282 --> 01:06:43,862
That's why they killed Mr. Matsuzaki.

875
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:48,679
Hattori.

876
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,359
You are saved

877
01:06:53,382 --> 01:06:56,876
I'm sorry to be so selfish.
I wonder what happened to the new drug.

878
01:06:57,508 --> 01:06:59,381
I saw KAKUNUMA's retirement announcement in the newspaper.

879
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,025
Where have you been?

880
01:07:01,279 --> 01:07:03,059
I suddenly needed some country air.

881
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:05,727
I'm relieved.

882
01:07:06,620 --> 01:07:08,513
Mr. President, what are you going to do now?

883
01:07:08,953 --> 01:07:09,666
What do you mean?

884
01:07:10,286 --> 01:07:14,206
We'd rather take our new drug data to YOSHINO than release it to the public.

885
01:07:16,721 --> 01:07:17,721
Yoshino.

886
01:07:20,178 --> 01:07:25,504
I'm sure she'll take good care of our new drug.
She'll take good care of our company.

887
01:07:26,294 --> 01:07:29,034
Actually, I ran into her by chance and asked her for advice.

888
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:32,071
I didn't leak any data on the new drug.

889
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,606
She doesn't care about the data.

890
01:07:35,854 --> 01:07:40,894
She thought she could damage her business rival Marquis by making Hattori disappear.

891
01:07:42,399 --> 01:07:45,645
But Yoshino was deceived by Maruki, just like us.

892
01:07:46,454 --> 01:07:52,280
But we can trust Yoshino. I hate her but
I agree.

893
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:55,667
Let's do it.
Mr. President... now's our chance.

894
01:07:59,204 --> 01:08:00,497
You all feel the same way?

895
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:10,020
If that's everyone's opinion, then I have no choice.

896
01:08:11,201 --> 01:08:13,354
I'm starting to think Yoshino is on our side.

897
01:08:15,199 --> 01:08:19,072
But I just need a little time first.

898
01:08:20,209 --> 01:08:21,529
Finding Matsuzaki's killer

899
01:08:22,762 --> 01:08:23,376
How?

900
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:28,646
Hisako is the key.
I'll make a trap.

901
01:08:29,761 --> 01:08:33,934
Call Yasuo,Kenji etc.

902
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,400
I found Hisako.

903
01:08:47,633 --> 01:08:50,239
Oh you are here.

904
01:08:50,612 --> 01:08:52,225
Sorry I was sleeping.

905
01:08:53,266 --> 01:08:54,573
What's wrong with Hisako?

906
01:08:54,959 --> 01:08:56,479
She's in a mental hospital.

907
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,881
She's become crazy.

908
01:09:00,264 --> 01:09:02,951
I didn't know that.

909
01:09:03,881 --> 01:09:06,135
But how did you find her?

910
01:09:06,707 --> 01:09:08,694
By chance.
Maybe Mr. Matsuzaki pulled her in.

911
01:09:09,111 --> 01:09:10,417
No way.

912
01:09:10,603 --> 01:09:12,290
She's the mistress of my benefactor.

913
01:09:12,963 --> 01:09:14,690
I'm gonna treat what's wrong with her.

914
01:09:14,814 --> 01:09:15,907
You're so stubborn.

915
01:09:16,686 --> 01:09:18,039
But That's what I love about you.

916
01:09:18,592 --> 01:09:20,459
OK I can help you.

917
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:23,125
I'm so impressed with your spirit.

918
01:09:23,565 --> 01:09:24,265
Thank you.

919
01:09:24,713 --> 01:09:27,453
They're going to move her to a hospital with better facilities than the one she's in now, and she'll be fine.

920
01:09:28,485 --> 01:09:30,419
I'll have the procedure done today.

921
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:43,158
This is great view.

922
01:09:44,333 --> 01:09:49,093
Thanks to this fictitious Marquis stock run-up.
That's how I got all this land.

923
01:09:50,010 --> 01:09:53,857
Dozens of times more money in the future.
I can't stop laughing.

924
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:56,687
I really appreciate you.

925
01:09:57,008 --> 01:10:00,415
But you've crossed a very dangerous road.

926
01:10:01,506 --> 01:10:04,286
This time, I was worried.

927
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:08,167
It can't be helped.
It's not like after the war.

928
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:12,964
It's hard to do drastic work when the world is at peace.

929
01:10:28,381 --> 01:10:29,648
Urgent business?

930
01:10:30,207 --> 01:10:32,821
IZUMIDA came to us after you left our apartment.

931
01:10:33,306 --> 01:10:35,153
He found a place for HISAKO.

932
01:10:36,114 --> 01:10:38,407
He's going to move her to another mental hospital.

933
01:10:38,818 --> 01:10:40,605
Ask someone to kill Hisako.

934
01:10:41,158 --> 01:10:43,238
Ask your boyfriend.

935
01:11:13,373 --> 01:11:15,513
Who the hell would come to kill that patient?

936
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:17,607
Excuse me, sir. Just a few more seconds.

937
01:11:17,719 --> 01:11:20,105
It's late. he might be relieved.

938
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,067
I'm sure they'll come.

939
01:11:27,156 --> 01:11:27,789
Coming.

940
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:30,436
He came from the gate.

941
01:11:31,042 --> 01:11:31,789
Be quiet.

942
01:11:57,815 --> 01:11:58,635
Oh you.

943
01:11:59,242 --> 01:12:01,022
Door is open.

944
01:12:05,113 --> 01:12:06,333
Can you come here?

945
01:12:06,726 --> 01:12:08,659
Why don't you just come in here?

946
01:12:09,623 --> 01:12:11,076
Come in.

947
01:12:11,549 --> 01:12:12,843
I can't afford to.

948
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:17,828
I found the rest of the money from Matsuzaki's murder.

949
01:12:18,765 --> 01:12:19,365
I've brought it.

950
01:12:21,992 --> 01:12:24,019
I'll give it to you, but you're gonna have to give me your hand.

951
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:32,570
Take your hands off .

952
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:35,517
Shut up.
I'm gonna strangle her.

953
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:39,118
I'll be there.

954
01:13:27,225 --> 01:13:28,759
You killed Matsuzaki.

955
01:13:32,193 --> 01:13:32,646
No.

956
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:37,273
How did you kill him?

957
01:13:38,699 --> 01:13:39,466
Tell me.

958
01:13:40,938 --> 01:13:41,618
Tell me.

959
01:13:45,271 --> 01:13:46,764
Tell me.

960
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,790
Hisako invited her to the cliff.
Then I pushed him.

961
01:13:55,492 --> 01:13:57,085
I was just asked.

962
01:13:57,925 --> 01:13:58,765
Sorry.

963
01:14:03,328 --> 01:14:05,395
You scam killed Matsuzaki.

964
01:14:34,937 --> 01:14:37,457
You don't have to do that.

965
01:14:38,347 --> 01:14:39,634
This is first day to work here so.

966
01:14:40,049 --> 01:14:42,789
Here's better than Maruki'S office.

967
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:45,975
But I really admire your skill, sir.

968
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,910
Don't be surprised by this
There's still a long way to go.

969
01:14:51,135 --> 01:14:54,855
I must do my best so that I can report well to you in the future.

970
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:04,292
Here's nice.

971
01:15:06,422 --> 01:15:07,822
Why you are here?

972
01:15:09,622 --> 01:15:10,635
I'm here to celebrate.

973
01:15:12,302 --> 01:15:16,282
It's wonderful to see you start a new business after destroying Maruki.

974
01:15:16,721 --> 01:15:21,481
I've been under house arrest with the intention of never going out in the world again.
But people around here won't leave me alone.

975
01:15:21,899 --> 01:15:26,539
I'm sorry to say this but I have to stop your weird acting.

976
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:29,568
You are rude.
Get out.

977
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:32,979
This guy came here to say he's a sore loser.

978
01:15:33,649 --> 01:15:34,489
Don't worry.

979
01:15:35,411 --> 01:15:39,244
Well then, Mr. Tsunonuma... shall we listen to my sore loser speech?

980
01:15:40,874 --> 01:15:48,104
You asked Hisako to the cliff.
You forced Hisako to mimic psychosis to protect your secret.

981
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:53,016
I'm the only one who retained Matsuzaki because of his ability.

982
01:15:53,879 --> 01:15:55,919
I even recommended him for the board.

983
01:15:56,230 --> 01:15:57,583
Why would I kill him?

984
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,649
You took over Maruki with the intention of eating it up from the start.

985
01:16:01,872 --> 01:16:06,226
You wanted to bring Mr. Matsuzaki on board so that you could take advantage of our new drug and inflate your stock.

986
01:16:07,124 --> 01:16:12,003
But Mr. Matsuzaki saw through your plan and approached Yoshino Seiyaku.

987
01:16:13,271 --> 01:16:18,604
When you learned of this from Hisako's report, you killed Matsuzaki out of fear that your plan would be foiled.

988
01:16:19,267 --> 01:16:22,087
I know who you asked.
Tachibana,right?

989
01:16:23,134 --> 01:16:25,281
You're young.

990
01:16:25,868 --> 01:16:31,509
I don't mean to be rude.
You were a YAKUZA, after all.

991
01:16:32,517 --> 01:16:35,759
What you say is not a reasonable opinion.

992
01:16:36,142 --> 01:16:37,626
YAKUZA is that bad?

993
01:16:39,149 --> 01:16:41,642
It's better than being a murderer like you.

994
01:16:42,009 --> 01:16:43,017
Murderer?

995
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:47,399
I'll laugh at you for the rest of my life.
You won't be laughing anymore.

996
01:16:47,915 --> 01:16:50,493
I'll pull the curtain back on your play.
Get out.

997
01:16:51,056 --> 01:16:53,368
What if I turn Tachibana over to the police?

998
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:56,540
There's nothing I can do.
I don't know this Tachibana guy at all.

999
01:16:57,126 --> 01:16:59,595
He probably doesn't know me either.

1000
01:17:14,946 --> 01:17:18,156
Mr. Kakunuma, what is the name of this person?

1001
01:17:18,953 --> 01:17:21,110
I don't know.

1002
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:28,296
I'll tell everything.

1003
01:17:29,336 --> 01:17:30,617
I'll betray you this time.

1004
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:32,250
She's a madwoman, a lunatic.

1005
01:17:32,609 --> 01:17:34,437
You're the one who made me do crazy things.

1006
01:17:34,687 --> 01:17:37,789
You lured me out to kill Mr. Matsuzaki.

1007
01:17:38,046 --> 01:17:40,593
You're the one who wanted Tachibana to kill me.

1008
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:41,687
Idiot.

1009
01:17:43,686 --> 01:17:45,279
You're giving up.

1010
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:48,764
Mr.KAKUNUMA President.

1011
01:18:14,068 --> 01:18:14,732
Thank you very much for the other day.

1012
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:15,920
Welcome.

1013
01:18:18,078 --> 01:18:20,414
It's rare to see you two together today.

1014
01:18:21,961 --> 01:18:24,633
I finally found the man who killed Mr. Matsuzaki.

1015
01:18:25,398 --> 01:18:26,977
I heard about it on the news earlier.

1016
01:18:27,594 --> 01:18:30,969
Everything's been cleared up now.
I did what I promised.

1017
01:18:33,945 --> 01:18:36,070
We leave the sales of new drugs to you!

1018
01:18:36,805 --> 01:18:39,688
We would like to be of service to you.

1019
01:18:40,805 --> 01:18:44,953
Mr. Izumi, you're forgetting something.

1020
01:18:45,836 --> 01:18:50,164
I've heard that you have a policy of avoiding business relationships with women.

1021
01:18:51,383 --> 01:18:54,367
I've decided not to consider you a woman.

1022
01:18:55,516 --> 01:18:57,023
I'm sorry, but I can't.

1023
01:18:57,547 --> 01:18:58,203
You can't?

1024
01:19:01,378 --> 01:19:02,886
You say you don't want the new medicine.

1025
01:19:03,433 --> 01:19:05,441
That's Izumida-san. you are quick to guess.

1026
01:19:06,144 --> 01:19:08,308
You said exactly what I couldn't say.

1027
01:19:08,948 --> 01:19:12,816
And it seems Izumi Drug's business isn't good either.

1028
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:15,867
So I can't.

1029
01:19:17,047 --> 01:19:17,727
I see.

1030
01:19:21,368 --> 01:19:25,594
Never mind.
Many companies are interested in our new drug.

1031
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:28,704
Let's leave.

1032
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:30,907
Wait.

1033
01:19:31,657 --> 01:19:32,969
We've already talked about this.

1034
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:37,524
I went out of my way to come and see this for you.

1035
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:52,399
This is my new drug.

1036
01:19:53,680 --> 01:19:56,227
We developed this.

1037
01:19:57,415 --> 01:19:58,610
When did you make this?

1038
01:19:59,876 --> 01:20:01,321
This research can't be done by anyone else.

1039
01:20:01,508 --> 01:20:03,219
Yoshino's technical staff is very good.

1040
01:20:05,852 --> 01:20:06,719
You stole it!

1041
01:20:07,688 --> 01:20:09,399
I'll leave it to your imagination.

1042
01:20:09,665 --> 01:20:10,641
Damn it.

1043
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:11,313
Stop it.

1044
01:20:11,923 --> 01:20:13,274
She's ahead of us.
We lost.

1045
01:20:13,798 --> 01:20:15,063
I like your attitude.

1046
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:23,337
Ms. Izumi, if you accept me as a woman, I can give IZUMI Chemicals a job.

1047
01:20:25,911 --> 01:20:26,864
I decline.

1048
01:20:27,458 --> 01:20:31,138
I don't care if you come crying to me later.

1049
01:20:32,767 --> 01:20:34,102
That's a sore loser look on your face.

1050
01:20:34,821 --> 01:20:36,290
It's not so you.

1051
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:38,767
There's one thing I want to make sure of.

1052
01:20:40,391 --> 01:20:40,992
What is it?

1053
01:20:41,696 --> 01:20:46,017
Did you steal all of Hattori's data on the manufacturing process for the new drug?

1054
01:20:46,462 --> 01:20:49,415
It does not mean I stole it.

1055
01:20:50,548 --> 01:20:56,407
So the soil fungus is bio-intermediated in a liquid. That's exactly the same thing.

1056
01:20:56,563 --> 01:20:57,532
Yes that's it.

1057
01:20:58,681 --> 01:21:03,063
But it's an original invention of our laboratory.

1058
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,007
You think so?

1059
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:11,101
It's up to you to make it.

1060
01:21:11,836 --> 01:21:15,211
But only if you know you're infringing on a patent.

1061
01:21:18,865 --> 01:21:19,693
What does that mean?

1062
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:26,247
That we own the patents on those parts.
I'm just informing you again.

1063
01:21:29,888 --> 01:21:31,701
When did you take it?

1064
01:21:31,966 --> 01:21:35,458
A long time ago.
Mr. Matsuzaki gave me some advice.

1065
01:21:37,341 --> 01:21:41,404
Yoshino's new drug is against the patent law unless we change the culture equipment.

1066
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:44,638
It's absolutely impossible to change it.

1067
01:21:45,630 --> 01:21:47,951
It's the pivotal point of my invention.

1068
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,362
we won a come-from-behind victory.

1069
01:21:59,487 --> 01:22:03,776
I'm happy to discuss patent fees with you.

1070
01:22:04,315 --> 01:22:11,190
But 50% of the profits from the new drug.
We may want more than that.

1071
01:22:12,464 --> 01:22:14,690
This is thanks to Mr. Matsuzaki's advice.

1072
01:22:27,888 --> 01:22:30,029
It was close.

1073
01:22:30,357 --> 01:22:32,068
Mr. Matsuzaki saved us.

1074
01:22:32,396 --> 01:22:34,787
I'm sorry.
I was rude to you the other day.

1075
01:22:35,404 --> 01:22:37,568
I'm sorry I hit you.

1076
01:22:45,570 --> 01:22:47,524
Tajima!
You were the spy!

1077
01:22:47,641 --> 01:22:50,094
Leave him alone!
Forget that guy.

1078
01:22:50,742 --> 01:22:51,281
Let's go.

1079
01:22:57,953 --> 01:23:00,601
I guess everyone here has a life of their own.

1080
01:23:01,343 --> 01:23:02,953
they all live desperately.

1081
01:23:03,343 --> 01:23:05,640
A lot of people give up.

1082
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:07,929
But you won.

1083
01:23:11,444 --> 01:23:15,632
Tomorrow is a new battle.

1084
01:23:17,210 --> 01:23:18,663
You won't lose.

1085
01:23:25,677 --> 01:23:27,364
But I'm starving.

1086
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:30,216
I'll treat you a steak

1087
01:23:31,255 --> 01:23:33,247
I have never had a woman treat me to food.

1088
01:23:34,278 --> 01:23:35,294
But you have no money.

1089
01:23:36,802 --> 01:23:38,419
It can't be helped.
Thank you.

1090
01:23:41,044 --> 01:23:43,739
If we can establish a sales network for the new drug, there will be lots of money coming in.

1091
01:23:48,858 --> 01:23:52,514
Will you follow me for the rest of your life?

1092
01:23:58,949 --> 01:23:59,676
I will.

1093
01:24:22,338 --> 01:24:30,311
THE END

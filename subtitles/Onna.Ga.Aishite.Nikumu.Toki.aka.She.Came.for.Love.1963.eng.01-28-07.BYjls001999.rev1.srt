00:00:13,814 --> 00:00:21,514
Onna Ga Aishite Nikumu Toki / She Came for Love (1963)

3
00:01:58,726 --> 00:01:59,539
Good morning

4
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:04,554
The store clerk is the most important person in the store.

5
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,804
you should behave better

6
00:02:08,078 --> 00:02:08,711
I'm sorry

7
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:12,797
Imai

8
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,219
Please treat the customer at table 3.

9
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,735
take care of the customers in the restaurant

10
00:02:23,548 --> 00:02:24,321
good morning

11
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:28,985
Sorry I'm late.
The traffic was busy

12
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:31,524
You look good in Kimono

13
00:02:31,594 --> 00:02:33,040
I think the colors are very flashy

14
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,048
You look so nice

15
00:02:35,073 --> 00:02:38,595
People say business women are not beautiful, but you are not

16
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,446
I won't reward you for praising me

17
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,911
Everyone is here?

18
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,599
Toshiko has not come yet

19
00:02:46,997 --> 00:02:49,521
What's wrong?
she is very punctual

20
00:03:09,545 --> 00:03:14,115
master is out of store.
But he's coming back soon

21
00:03:15,389 --> 00:03:18,545
That shop looks very nice.
but the price is a little high

22
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:24,662
I think this cafe store is a very convenient place for you.

23
00:03:25,244 --> 00:03:26,564
Let's wait for him inside

24
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:27,939
Let me see another one

25
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,463
Just take a look

26
00:03:30,488 --> 00:03:32,377
I don't have time.
I have to go for Utsumi party

27
00:03:32,402 --> 00:03:33,357
Utsumi party?

28
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,864
People who were in Utsumi gather there once a month

29
00:03:37,396 --> 00:03:39,435
Is it a bar study group?

30
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,247
Kind of

31
00:03:42,381 --> 00:03:45,710
you might be easy going but customer is so scary

32
00:03:46,413 --> 00:03:49,538
Be careful even if you are a regular customer for 10 years More

33
00:03:50,124 --> 00:03:55,897
For example, if an udon restaurant opens nearby with cheap and delicious food, all customers will go there.

34
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,344
Bar is same

35
00:03:58,977 --> 00:04:05,133
we can look down on our customers.
They are just customers.

36
00:04:07,054 --> 00:04:10,210
I keep talking to myself today

37
00:04:10,929 --> 00:04:12,608
do you want to talk about something?

38
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:16,718
Do you know Marianne of the Minami?

39
00:04:17,663 --> 00:04:19,937
She said she opened a bar in Ginza, Tokyo.

40
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:23,116
in Ginza?
What's wrong?

41
00:04:24,022 --> 00:04:28,655
Bars are gorgeous these days

42
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,452
we are number one.
We should not stay quiet.

43
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:36,015
we want to be more dignified

44
00:04:37,882 --> 00:04:44,835
We are famous in Osaka, so That's why we have guests from Tokyo.

45
00:04:45,623 --> 00:04:49,552
We don't need to open a bar in Tokyo.

46
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:56,023
If you do that, it means that Ginza is better than Osaka.

47
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,335
Utsumi is Osaka's

48
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:02,898
We should not have a complex in Tokyo

49
00:05:03,148 --> 00:05:06,859
There are beautiful moms like this in Osaka too.

50
00:05:07,335 --> 00:05:11,624
There is someone in our group who likes Tokyo.

51
00:05:11,788 --> 00:05:14,351
You mean Toshiko?

52
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:22,146
Although she has lived in Osaka for a long time, she does not use the Osaka dialect.
I hate it

53
00:05:22,616 --> 00:05:24,842
If she doesn't use the Osaka dialect, she'll look smarter

54
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,186
I don't want to work with her

55
00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:35,662
she is so unique.
she has clients

56
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:38,248
Welcome

57
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:39,397
Upstairs?

58
00:05:45,236 --> 00:05:46,424
She's coming

59
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,041
Sorry I'm late

60
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:49,502
Have a seat

61
00:05:49,955 --> 00:05:51,260
were you with a man?

62
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:52,822
He stood up me

63
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:54,244
Oh I'm sorry

64
00:05:54,947 --> 00:05:57,189
I can't believe a man would stand up for a beautiful woman like you.

65
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:03,431
Seriously,you guys should be careful with men

66
00:06:04,029 --> 00:06:08,631
People say a beautiful madam can't be successful

67
00:06:09,626 --> 00:06:13,188
The bar lady is the customer's common property

68
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:20,282
Guys are easily jealous of bar women

69
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:27,303
The store loses credibility.
So you be careful with men,Toshiko

70
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:35,147
Since she came, we only talk about men. You date with anyone?

71
00:06:35,524 --> 00:06:39,227
all my customers are my boyfriends

72
00:06:40,118 --> 00:06:41,805
tell me the secrets

73
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:48,007
what is the name of your bar chief?

74
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,233
Ecchan?

75
00:06:49,577 --> 00:06:51,367
he is too handsome to be a bartender

76
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:54,788
someone asked me if he was your boyfriend

77
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,523
Oh I see

78
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,163
Handsome men make customers jealous

79
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,230
But he works hard

80
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,816
Thank you very much

81
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:16,348
It's been a while

82
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:17,268
Hi Madam

83
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:19,479
How are you?

84
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,487
Give him a glass of water.

85
00:07:24,955 --> 00:07:26,096
Welcome

86
00:07:26,932 --> 00:07:30,752
I prefer scotch whiskey.
I prefer Madam here

87
00:07:30,777 --> 00:07:32,283
Thank you very much

88
00:07:32,784 --> 00:07:36,659
You forgot something.
We prefer your shop

89
00:07:37,127 --> 00:07:38,979
Thank you very much

90
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:41,685
Welcome

91
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,724
were you with a man?

92
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:44,521
You look scary

93
00:07:44,763 --> 00:07:46,396
It's hard for me to go to a man I like

94
00:07:46,421 --> 00:07:49,537
you are very good at talking

95
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:51,170
I'll kiss you

96
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,748
Whiskey is ok?

97
00:07:55,022 --> 00:07:57,420
prepare whiskey for him

98
00:07:57,936 --> 00:08:02,006
Ecchan,make a highball

99
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:10,301
He's calling you

100
00:08:11,136 --> 00:08:12,855
Please turn off that NEON

101
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:19,718
It's difficult to buy whiskey these days.

102
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:21,679
you are good at business

103
00:08:21,704 --> 00:08:24,788
business is bad these days

104
00:08:24,952 --> 00:08:27,991
Really?
You look good in this tie

105
00:08:30,171 --> 00:08:35,162
Made in Scotland.
Similar to scotch liquor

106
00:08:35,342 --> 00:08:37,694
I got this from a lady

107
00:08:37,795 --> 00:08:40,944
Being handsome is good.
Don't play with our girls

108
00:08:54,002 --> 00:08:54,737
What's wrong?

109
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:56,362
Can you come tonight?

110
00:08:56,987 --> 00:08:58,643
I'm bust these days

111
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:03,123
you are no longer kind.
please give me back my money

112
00:09:03,694 --> 00:09:07,803
I will pay you back later

113
00:09:09,576 --> 00:09:11,662
I'm sorry I have to take care of you

114
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,889
We're used to it

115
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:19,483
Women's minds don't work like business

116
00:09:19,508 --> 00:09:20,850
Really

117
00:09:21,371 --> 00:09:26,723
he cares about you all the way

118
00:09:26,794 --> 00:09:28,083
Really?

119
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:34,115
The bar here is always crowded.
we have no chance to talk to you

120
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,592
What's wrong?

121
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,428
you serve your customers too much

122
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:52,084
Is that bad?

123
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:54,707
I want to please my customers

124
00:09:56,082 --> 00:09:56,988
I know but

125
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:03,019
It's not good to seduce men too much

126
00:10:03,634 --> 00:10:07,165
men want to be seduced by women

127
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,798
this is not a restaurant

128
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:12,204
Right. but I hate doing that

129
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:15,080
Customers get used to it

130
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:19,947
This is our store's policy

131
00:10:27,143 --> 00:10:31,245
Madam has no lover?

132
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:38,594
She's picky.
She does not show her private.

133
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,873
Who support her to open this bar?

134
00:10:44,193 --> 00:10:49,108
She used the money from her divorce and a loan from the bank.

135
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:50,225
Welcome

136
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:58,645
Welcome

137
00:10:59,106 --> 00:10:59,817
A lot of customers

138
00:10:59,918 --> 00:11:01,340
Thank you

139
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:03,353
Can I sit inside of kitchen?

140
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:06,228
You are good at kidding

141
00:11:10,624 --> 00:11:11,710
I’ll go around

142
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:13,554
I'm sorry

143
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,845
He might be her lover

144
00:11:18,938 --> 00:11:24,938
It's suspicious to casually go outside when it's full.

145
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,890
I guess he is her lover

146
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,796
I was sorry I was busy

147
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:35,528
I worried no one came

148
00:11:38,536 --> 00:11:39,325
Your business is doing great

149
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:41,755
Did you come today?

150
00:11:41,895 --> 00:11:45,075
I flew in this morning for a meeting at the venue.

151
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:46,964
I'll go back by last flight

152
00:11:47,355 --> 00:11:48,745
You are always busy

153
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,597
He's Ozaki who works as producer

154
00:11:53,706 --> 00:11:54,745
producer?

155
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:59,831
He brings actors or singers from overseas

156
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:01,730
I see

157
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:06,276
He's young and sometimes in the weekly papers.

158
00:12:07,564 --> 00:12:09,118
I saw the concert poster

159
00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:11,017
Did you see?

160
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,025
It was so great

161
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:15,478
I was offered a million dollar tie-in by a pharmaceutical company, but I turned it down.

162
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,618
What a waste

163
00:12:16,783 --> 00:12:21,111
I want to work my way.

164
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,332
See you

165
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,582
Take care

166
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:33,113
Thank you

167
00:12:36,531 --> 00:12:39,797
You should visit her house if you are curious

168
00:12:40,609 --> 00:12:42,937
You can see if man is there or not

169
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:47,441
I get it. I will drop her off at her house tonight

170
00:12:51,994 --> 00:12:58,525
I've always wanted to look where you live

171
00:12:59,502 --> 00:13:03,009
You are so pervert

172
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:07,180
It's pervert man look around woman's house

173
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:10,158
Stop at the crossing

174
00:13:10,183 --> 00:13:12,745
I'll drop you off at your house

175
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,377
Don't worry.
The street is too narrow

176
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,877
Don't worry.
Keep driving

177
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,784
You live in big house

178
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:32,042
I'll serve you a tea

179
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:32,870
Thanks

180
00:13:33,182 --> 00:13:34,159
Come in

181
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,602
Come in

182
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:58,211
Have a seat

183
00:13:58,398 --> 00:13:59,500
Thanks

184
00:14:00,164 --> 00:14:01,609
Wanna drink brandy?

185
00:14:01,703 --> 00:14:02,914
Just tea is fine

186
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:07,115
Do you have ashtray?

187
00:14:07,326 --> 00:14:10,146
Sorry, I don't smoke

188
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:15,704
Here it is

189
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:20,423
This ashtray is a memento from the opening of the restaurant.

190
00:14:20,611 --> 00:14:22,571
You've got great memory

191
00:14:22,798 --> 00:14:23,720
Because I love you

192
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:34,050
There's no ashtray so It seems she has no lover

193
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,199
I found out

194
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:56,830
I didn't know there was nice apartment in Tennoji

195
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:58,048
This is new apartment

196
00:14:58,949 --> 00:14:59,606
I see

197
00:15:02,223 --> 00:15:03,504
It's single bed

198
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:06,402
But don't trust yet

199
00:15:07,277 --> 00:15:10,324
Check the razor at bathroom

200
00:15:14,388 --> 00:15:15,748
What are you talking about?

201
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,342
It's nothing

202
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:20,013
Sorry Lemon is shorted

203
00:15:20,548 --> 00:15:23,126
It's lonely that women live alone

204
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:26,134
I wanna go to bathroom

205
00:15:26,423 --> 00:15:27,782
In this way

206
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,497
Thanks

207
00:15:49,522 --> 00:15:50,624
Oh brandy

208
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:57,460
They say adding brandy to tea is bad for you.

209
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:59,233
Are you sure?

210
00:16:04,724 --> 00:16:05,661
There was no razor

211
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,028
You look weird

212
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,235
Don't be upset

213
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:15,039
We're here to check if you have lover or not

214
00:16:15,078 --> 00:16:16,625
No way

215
00:16:17,868 --> 00:16:20,875
I gonna left my pajama here

216
00:16:22,274 --> 00:16:24,149
Madam from bar shouldn't make a lover

217
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,344
Why?

218
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:27,594
Our customers share us

219
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:30,771
Oh I feel sorry

220
00:16:30,888 --> 00:16:34,700
I won't invite him if I have a lover

221
00:16:35,263 --> 00:16:40,028
I see.
How much is the rent for here?

222
00:16:40,496 --> 00:16:44,324
It's expensive but this is what I need for my work

223
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,433
Just like our company moved to expensive place

224
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:52,951
Oh it's 1:30 am.
Your wife got angry

225
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,834
Your wife got angry too

226
00:16:58,704 --> 00:17:01,633
Shall we go for drive to Akashi next Sunday?

227
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:05,204
I'm busy next Sunday

228
00:17:05,508 --> 00:17:06,672
I see

229
00:17:06,844 --> 00:17:07,860
Sorry

230
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:38,507
Madam

231
00:17:39,366 --> 00:17:40,812
Are you alone?

232
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:41,523
Yes

233
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,437
Same here

234
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:45,562
Why you are here?

235
00:17:46,624 --> 00:17:52,733
I like to be outside sometimes.

236
00:17:53,288 --> 00:17:54,999
I was surprised

237
00:17:56,497 --> 00:17:58,942
You remember there was 3 days off in this spring?

238
00:17:59,817 --> 00:18:05,356
I didn't do anything at home and My helper told me I was too lonely woman

239
00:18:07,138 --> 00:18:08,911
So I often come here during day time

240
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:12,567
I don't like day time neither

241
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:15,489
Day is long

242
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:20,333
I don't wanna play golf

243
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:24,106
I feel like going to Hawaii next month

244
00:18:24,419 --> 00:18:30,544
I envy you.
Our bar won't be busy until autumn

245
00:18:43,552 --> 00:18:45,990
Can I excuse?

246
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,584
Why?
You've just come

247
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:50,990
I don't feel good

248
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:57,712
Is it a woman's privilege?

249
00:18:58,376 --> 00:19:00,571
She'll get better as soon as she see her boyfriend

250
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:08,019
I worry if Nobu find us

251
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:10,019
Don't worry

252
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:13,952
He's so strict

253
00:19:14,515 --> 00:19:16,226
Never mind

254
00:19:29,061 --> 00:19:30,202
Welcome

255
00:19:32,217 --> 00:19:33,061
Welcome

256
00:19:34,178 --> 00:19:38,217
Can I get scotch with water?

257
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:41,896
Shall I make softer?

258
00:19:42,256 --> 00:19:43,733
You know what I like

259
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,100
Are you busy?

260
00:19:46,717 --> 00:19:48,436
We're fine

261
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:52,720
Where's Madam?

262
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:56,368
She's sick these days

263
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:57,774
I see

264
00:19:59,321 --> 00:19:59,970
Say take care to her

265
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:01,954
Thanks

266
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:06,149
You always work.
Do you have wife?

267
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,289
No one wanna marry me

268
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:14,147
Where's Madam's apartment?

269
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:18,022
She doesn't tell me

270
00:20:19,147 --> 00:20:20,412
does she shut you up?

271
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:21,655
No way

272
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:23,451
Welcome

273
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:28,784
Never mind.
Say hi to her

274
00:20:28,823 --> 00:20:29,823
Thanks

275
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:33,114
He looks good

276
00:20:33,801 --> 00:20:34,817
Don't play with him

277
00:20:35,028 --> 00:20:35,903
Why?

278
00:20:36,184 --> 00:20:37,481
He is Madam's ex husband

279
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:39,919
He?

280
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:44,969
he looks good and rich.
Why she divorced?

281
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,876
Ask her

282
00:20:47,157 --> 00:20:48,360
She gonna hit me

283
00:21:20,401 --> 00:21:21,768
Welcome

284
00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:27,411
sorry I’m off work

285
00:21:27,436 --> 00:21:29,708
Business won't thrive without you

286
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,006
Don't pay the followers off him

287
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:35,975
Sorry

288
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,084
How's your health?

289
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:42,443
Sleeping is harder than being sick

290
00:21:43,288 --> 00:21:45,663
Kitahara was just here

291
00:21:48,327 --> 00:21:49,210
He was staying long?

292
00:21:49,303 --> 00:21:52,787
He left as soon as he saw you weren't here.

293
00:21:54,741 --> 00:21:56,445
Don't talk to him

294
00:21:56,624 --> 00:21:57,452
Welcome

295
00:22:00,296 --> 00:22:02,695
It's been a while

296
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,614
I brought her today

297
00:22:08,551 --> 00:22:09,864
please take a seat in the back

298
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,229
You look good in Kimono

299
00:22:15,174 --> 00:22:17,041
You got better now?

300
00:22:17,158 --> 00:22:18,307
Thanks

301
00:22:22,528 --> 00:22:24,231
this is a very nice shop

302
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,958
are you flattering?

303
00:22:25,983 --> 00:22:27,232
I mean it

304
00:22:27,824 --> 00:22:31,722
This woman has no sense of the interior decoration of the shop.

305
00:22:32,293 --> 00:22:34,332
he likes to speak ill of people

306
00:22:34,857 --> 00:22:37,537
He is very quiet as a member of parliament.

307
00:22:38,436 --> 00:22:42,561
he sits like a doll on TV

308
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:45,256
he just clap

309
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:49,069
She likes to speak ill of people more than I do.

310
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:52,558
Do you guys drink the usual drinks?

311
00:22:52,583 --> 00:22:55,214
I don't know the taste, so I want to drink expensive alcohol

312
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:59,107
Please prepare two water and water from the old party

313
00:23:02,138 --> 00:23:03,099
Welcome

314
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:11,215
This diamond tie clip is lovely

315
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,028
this is just a glass ball

316
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:15,091
It's a  diamond that matches her

317
00:23:15,302 --> 00:23:16,818
I want this diamond too

318
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:19,146
I want diamonds for earrings

319
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:20,927
You are funny

320
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,357
Can you buy for me?

321
00:23:22,382 --> 00:23:24,055
diamond earrings are nice

322
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:28,344
Ok but you should listen to me

323
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:32,539
you are good at telling jokes.
Don't trust him

324
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,000
Shut up

325
00:23:34,539 --> 00:23:38,891
I think this store is more fun for me than your store.

326
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:42,899
Welcome

327
00:23:46,766 --> 00:23:47,930

What do you eat?

329
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,169
I wanna eat tuna

330
00:24:00,693 --> 00:24:02,044
is this delicious?

331
00:24:02,161 --> 00:24:03,482
Yes

332
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,576
I want one

333
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:07,068
Give me more

334
00:24:07,716 --> 00:24:09,060
It tastes good

335
00:24:09,287 --> 00:24:12,217
you should go home and rest

336
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:16,116
Thanks.
I'm leaving

337
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:18,155
I'll drop her off

338
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:19,984
Thanks

339
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:45,334
I'm Ikuta.
Can you send me a cab?

340
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:47,779
Tennoji apartment.
You know right?

341
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,534
I wanna sleep more

342
00:26:36,206 --> 00:26:38,190
I worked until 3 am last night

343
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,649
How was your flight?

344
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:45,524
I was sleeping all the way

345
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,622
I was sleeping

346
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:40,096
you were snoring

347
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:41,572
Oh no

348
00:27:42,346 --> 00:27:43,244
What time now?

349
00:27:44,611 --> 00:27:47,213
Don't worry about time?

350
00:27:47,836 --> 00:27:49,508
I don't wanna waste my time

351
00:27:55,312 --> 00:27:59,663
I'm from Shin Nihon TV.
Can I talk to Mr.Shirai who is musical department?

352
00:28:00,523 --> 00:28:01,390
I'm Ozaki

353
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,206
How was the work?

354
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:11,081
he is a very popular singer in America

355
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:15,057
I’m not going to discount

356
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:17,603
So 5 pm

357
00:28:19,843 --> 00:28:20,515
See you

358
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:24,343
do you work for TV?

359
00:28:24,726 --> 00:28:26,304
I want many people to listen to his music

360
00:28:27,458 --> 00:28:29,809
If there is a deficit, it will make up for it

361
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:36,458
I always feel sorry

362
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:38,677
For what?

363
00:28:39,974 --> 00:28:41,669
I lie to my customers.

364
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,528
Everyone think I am single

365
00:28:48,383 --> 00:28:50,446
I always feel sorry for that

366
00:28:51,375 --> 00:28:53,711
It can't be helped.
It's true

367
00:28:54,446 --> 00:28:55,485
You think so?

368
00:28:57,071 --> 00:29:00,282
all the customers are lying too

369
00:29:01,188 --> 00:29:02,540
How's your business?

370
00:29:02,844 --> 00:29:04,282
I'm in trouble

371
00:29:05,957 --> 00:29:07,293
Look at this

372
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:15,224
The average monthly sales is 1.2 million yen.

373
00:29:16,208 --> 00:29:17,654
you have a tax problem

374
00:29:17,818 --> 00:29:18,841
I'm in trouble

375
00:29:19,396 --> 00:29:21,536
you should set up a company

376
00:29:21,907 --> 00:29:22,750
I got headache

377
00:29:23,391 --> 00:29:25,469
I recommended it when you open the bar

378
00:29:25,774 --> 00:29:29,813
I'm not a bad like you, so I didn't think about such things.

379
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,942
I can help you with your taxes

380
00:29:34,615 --> 00:29:35,435
You?

381
00:29:37,585 --> 00:29:39,929
I have never given you financial assistance

382
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:43,148
I don't want to receive money like a mistress

383
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:48,381
We don't have a family register relationship with money

384
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:13,857
Hi Ozeki

385
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:16,092
Your friend?

386
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:17,490
That's right

387
00:30:20,781 --> 00:30:23,718
Don't worry.
No one know you

388
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:30,811
I'm just wearing clean clothes and acting nice

389
00:30:31,398 --> 00:30:34,273
I'm like a doll in a shop window

390
00:30:34,298 --> 00:30:37,649
You can't do business without sacrificing something

391
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:40,322
Men's businesses don't care about that, do they?

392
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:43,619
No way.
We give it a shot

393
00:30:45,292 --> 00:30:47,261
don't be afraid to take risks

394
00:30:48,394 --> 00:30:50,933
I plan to bring Elvis Presley to Japan next year.

395
00:30:51,417 --> 00:30:53,526
no one has ever done

396
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:55,933
It costs a lot

397
00:30:56,214 --> 00:31:00,878
I plan to bring him to Japan and set a lot of expensive entrance fees.

398
00:31:01,415 --> 00:31:03,673
I am always worried about your business

399
00:31:04,368 --> 00:31:09,423
It deserves.
I want to bring a world-famous singer to Japan.

400
00:31:10,692 --> 00:31:13,653
I'll give it a shot

401
00:31:16,893 --> 00:31:19,159
life is like gambling

402
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:30,549
what are you thinking about ?

403
00:31:32,996 --> 00:31:35,222
I was thinking of breaking up with you

404
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:38,066
breaking up?

405
00:31:39,238 --> 00:31:44,183
Seeing you satisfied makes me feel lonely

406
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,578
You feel like you don't need me.

407
00:31:50,907 --> 00:31:52,641
have you ever thought about breaking up?

408
00:31:53,723 --> 00:31:55,176
Never

409
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,879
I stop over thinking

410
00:32:01,485 --> 00:32:05,703
I heard about the sale of a bar in Ginza last night.

411
00:32:06,617 --> 00:32:07,680
would you recommend it to me?

412
00:32:09,089 --> 00:32:10,613
Is it ok if I go to Tokyo?

413
00:32:11,043 --> 00:32:14,324
I think business doesn't have to be in Osaka.

414
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:16,457
I hate kitahara

415
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:28,060
I never thought that I would go from Tokyo to Osaka to marry and become a bar madam.

416
00:32:29,482 --> 00:32:31,904
How's Kitahara now?

417
00:32:33,115 --> 00:32:34,998
He visited me last day

418
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:39,286
I think he wants to marry you again

419
00:32:39,794 --> 00:32:42,622
I have no idea.
He's just a friend now

420
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,060
He is my classmate and a very nice person.

421
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:47,692
stop talking about him

422
00:32:49,477 --> 00:32:52,484
What if he knows about us?

423
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:00,111
I met you for the first time when he asked me to talk about his work with you.

424
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:04,087
It was right after I started working at Utsumi

425
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:07,134
You worked so hard at that time

426
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:09,119
That's my way

427
00:33:11,704 --> 00:33:14,118
A lot has happened since then

428
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:26,656
What if Mr. Kitahara asked for it when he got married, not when he got divorced...

429
00:33:29,391 --> 00:33:32,243
I could marry you

430
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,692
If I had no wife

431
00:33:37,848 --> 00:33:39,043
I wanna marry you

432
00:33:40,543 --> 00:33:44,153
This is the first time I heard about your marriage.

433
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm not thinking about marriage so don't worry

434
00:33:54,018 --> 00:33:57,315
I'm not a diplomat like your wife

435
00:33:57,604 --> 00:34:00,682
I don't speak a foreign language

436
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,129
your wife is needed for your job

437
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,582
It might be so

438
00:34:09,629 --> 00:34:11,856
but she doesn't know anything about art

439
00:34:12,856 --> 00:34:15,543
do you know this word?

440
00:34:16,628 --> 00:34:20,042
Please treat the person who comes to the bar and speaks ill of his wife appropriately.

441
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:25,175
In short,customers like that are trash

442
00:34:26,924 --> 00:34:28,236
You are that kind of person too?

443
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:35,189
I see you as a woman

444
00:34:36,071 --> 00:34:42,391
I see. I want to have your baby

445
00:34:48,118 --> 00:34:49,126
What the hell?

446
00:34:51,017 --> 00:34:54,267
Women want to have children with the person they love.

447
00:34:55,798 --> 00:34:59,642
But I can't take six months off to have a baby

448
00:35:01,654 --> 00:35:03,927
So don't worry

449
00:35:07,583 --> 00:35:09,747
Time files

450
00:35:11,017 --> 00:35:11,806
when will you return?

451
00:35:12,915 --> 00:35:14,892
I'll board at 4pm

452
00:35:15,931 --> 00:35:17,376
I'll drop you off at Haneda

453
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,690
don't worry.
I don't like it

454
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,433
I'm free on 23rd

455
00:35:26,798 --> 00:35:27,681
Fine

456
00:35:31,267 --> 00:35:31,728
See you

457
00:35:54,715 --> 00:35:58,645
Stupid.
What if someone come?

458
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,645
I don't care

459
00:36:04,395 --> 00:36:06,098
You are bad baby

460
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,275
We're Ozaki production

461
00:36:20,463 --> 00:36:21,877
Good morning

462
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,580
Is that ok?

463
00:36:23,916 --> 00:36:25,642
Don't worry

464
00:36:29,188 --> 00:36:32,102
I got a call from Arai of Nippon Television.

465
00:36:32,954 --> 00:36:34,766
He'll be late

466
00:36:35,503 --> 00:36:37,768
we were having a meeting

467
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,893
All right

468
00:36:39,135 --> 00:36:40,565
We're about to finish it

469
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:48,090
I heard that the new exchange clerk was his father's subordinate.

470
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:52,965
I invited him to dinner for business

471
00:36:53,332 --> 00:36:54,535
That's good for us

472
00:36:55,051 --> 00:36:56,035
You wanna join us?

473
00:36:56,504 --> 00:36:58,426
I'll leave it to you

474
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:05,206
You're meeting with the embassy at 9 o'clock, aren't you?

475
00:37:05,308 --> 00:37:06,308
That's right

476
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:09,620
I will meet you when my work is finished.
I invite them to a nightclub

477
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,261
I'm going

478
00:37:38,085 --> 00:37:39,350
This drink is good for your health

479
00:37:40,616 --> 00:37:41,749
Why?

480
00:37:42,483 --> 00:37:45,233
You look tired today

481
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:48,452
You think so?

482
00:37:54,607 --> 00:37:55,740
I knew you were in Utsumi

483
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,661
I worked there as trainee

484
00:37:57,802 --> 00:37:59,756
I wanna go there

485
00:37:59,802 --> 00:38:01,685
have you never been?

486
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:07,881
It is difficult for Tokyo people to go where Osaka people are.

487
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,461
I don't think so

488
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:11,922
Everyone who spends money is a customer

489
00:38:12,672 --> 00:38:14,273
I'll show you

490
00:38:14,453 --> 00:38:15,383
Thanks

491
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:18,121
But it costs a lot

492
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:20,371
Please spend a lot of money

493
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,089
Nobu..come

494
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:37,002
I heard that you've been collecting business cards from your customers lately.

495
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:40,856
It's none of your business

496
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:45,012
If you quit your job, tell me plainly

497
00:39:04,191 --> 00:39:05,418
Thanks

498
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:13,980
we are like outsiders.
Madam doesn't greet us

499
00:39:14,396 --> 00:39:17,271
But there are a lot of customers

500
00:39:24,127 --> 00:39:25,916
Welcome

501
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,191
What do you want?

502
00:39:30,707 --> 00:39:32,590
Here's liquor looks expensive

503
00:39:34,879 --> 00:39:36,598
Oh you are here

504
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:38,246
How're you?

505
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:43,629
I eat a lot of good food with the public's tax dollars.

506
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,247
how is your business?

507
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:47,372
We're all right

508
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,021
Not as busy as this bar

509
00:39:49,552 --> 00:39:54,185
I think this bar will be closed soon.
The bar here is overpriced

510
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,123
You talk badly

511
00:39:57,685 --> 00:40:01,178
I like the young sexy women in your bar

512
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,623
Oh Nobu?

513
00:40:02,908 --> 00:40:09,385
I forgot her name but she has nice figure

514
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:16,908
Shall we leave?

515
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,447
Yeah

516
00:40:19,463 --> 00:40:21,002
Oh Madam is coming

517
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:26,908
He's our customer. Ichimura

518
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:28,126
Welcome

519
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,674
you are prosperous in business

520
00:40:29,776 --> 00:40:30,987
Thanks

521
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,871
Can you get out?

522
00:40:51,429 --> 00:40:57,499
I don't want to tell you this but,You guys should not do obscene services

523
00:40:57,942 --> 00:40:59,403
About Nobu?

524
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:04,207
I want people who used to work at this store to do their jobs correctly.

525
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:06,379
Sorry, I tell it to her

526
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:10,457
That's Ok.
I wanna ask you something

527
00:41:11,207 --> 00:41:12,996
where do you get your whiskey from?

528
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:15,832
From Meiji and Omaki

529
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:16,903
You do?

530
00:41:17,129 --> 00:41:18,707
Yes me and Ecchan

531
00:41:22,137 --> 00:41:28,473
I think you will make a good purchase, but please don't sell too cheap.

532
00:41:29,303 --> 00:41:32,443
Customers say we are expensive

533
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:37,232
Mr.Ishi told me about it earlier

534
00:41:37,412 --> 00:41:39,560
he has a foul mouth

535
00:41:39,585 --> 00:41:41,256
Not only him

536
00:41:42,256 --> 00:41:44,545
everyone compares to your bar

537
00:41:45,709 --> 00:41:49,662
There are price quotes in the area.

538
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:51,519
Sorry

539
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,379
I'm counting on you

540
00:43:11,286 --> 00:43:12,036
Hello?

541
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:18,061
What's wrong? It's already 1p.m.
I was going to call you

542
00:43:20,393 --> 00:43:25,276
A black agent asked me to rescind the contract.

543
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:27,909
Oh I'm sorry

544
00:43:29,016 --> 00:43:31,773
I can imagine that you are in a lot of trouble

545
00:43:34,227 --> 00:43:35,735
I'm serious

546
00:43:36,596 --> 00:43:42,292
If the concert cannot be held, there will be a loss of 20 million yen.

547
00:43:44,861 --> 00:43:45,526
Why do you laugh?

548
00:43:46,283 --> 00:43:52,994
I’m laughing at myself.
I thought it was time to say goodbye while I was waiting here

549
00:43:53,811 --> 00:43:55,170
I was telling myself that

550
00:43:58,131 --> 00:43:58,803
We gonna break up?

551
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,576
No no

552
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:06,562
When I imagine you in trouble, I think you need me

553
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:13,188
I fly home.
Don't worry. good luck

554
00:44:29,206 --> 00:44:29,862
good morning

555
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:31,049
good morning

556
00:44:31,292 --> 00:44:32,354
Ecchan has not come yet?

557
00:44:34,183 --> 00:44:34,901
well

558
00:44:42,194 --> 00:44:43,709
Are you Toshiko Ikuta?

559
00:44:44,194 --> 00:44:44,741
Yes

560
00:44:45,006 --> 00:44:47,842
I belong to the Shoneza Police Station

561
00:44:48,826 --> 00:44:49,522
What?

562
00:44:49,842 --> 00:44:53,350
I've been looking for you since this morning, but you weren't at the apartment.

563
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:54,758
Where have you been?

564
00:44:56,758 --> 00:44:59,977
can you come to the police?

565
00:45:00,266 --> 00:45:03,508
we don't want to interfere with business

566
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:05,654
A bartender named Ejiri also says that

567
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,787
Ecchan too?

568
00:45:07,521 --> 00:45:10,685
I don't understand anything.
is it okay to talk here

569
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:12,370
you should pay attention to the eyes around you

570
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,550
There was a IBON of shochu

571
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,386
this label is new

572
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:22,339
Welcome

573
00:45:22,573 --> 00:45:24,909
We close today, sorry

574
00:45:27,363 --> 00:45:31,051
please come another day, sorry

575
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,544
Please turn off the light on the signboard

576
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:41,200
you guys go home

577
00:45:42,036 --> 00:45:42,778
No no

578
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,901
Please wait here until the investigation is over.

579
00:45:44,955 --> 00:45:47,776
After all, you should go to the police station

580
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:51,401
I don't mind doing it here

581
00:45:52,508 --> 00:45:55,813
Do you know a man named Hatanaka?

582
00:45:56,102 --> 00:45:57,133
No

583
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,156
I know,right?

584
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:04,410
Lots of fake whiskey sold by his minions from here.

585
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:05,707
Look

586
00:46:07,517 --> 00:46:08,392
fake whiskey

587
00:46:10,493 --> 00:46:15,767
He is missing after going to Haneda Airport.

588
00:46:16,212 --> 00:46:17,954
I have nothing to do with that

589
00:46:18,056 --> 00:46:19,087
What?

590
00:46:20,267 --> 00:46:27,907
You were also on the same plane at 2 o'clock this morning.

591
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:31,040
I wasn't with him

592
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:32,251
who were you with?

593
00:46:32,696 --> 00:46:33,337
Alone

594
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,506
why should I tell you about my private affairs?

595
00:46:35,631 --> 00:46:37,124
We need to know

596
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:43,311
we checked with the airline.
I heard that you often fly to Tokyo.

597
00:46:50,301 --> 00:46:52,520
where did you go after haneda airport?

598
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:58,465
If you don't tell me, you have to go to POLICE

599
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:00,815
I wasn't with him

600
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,143
who were you with?

601
00:47:04,596 --> 00:47:06,502
who were you with?

602
00:47:07,314 --> 00:47:09,994
An employee here tells us all about it.

603
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:17,435
Tell us

604
00:47:18,575 --> 00:47:23,185
Even if you keep quiet, I think Madam has already spoken.

605
00:47:25,304 --> 00:47:28,054
Tell us where is Hatanaka?

606
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,960
Oh, you love the Madam?

607
00:47:33,492 --> 00:47:36,867
you pretend not to know.
but we already have proof

608
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:41,937
who informed you?

609
00:47:42,207 --> 00:47:43,253
Who?

610
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:45,230
I'm sure someone from Utsumi

611
00:47:50,342 --> 00:47:52,772
you had better talk quickly

612
00:47:53,959 --> 00:47:57,522
Who did you meet before you got off from Haneda Airport and boarded the plane at 4:00?

613
00:47:58,658 --> 00:48:00,493
I was at the beach hotel in Hayama.

614
00:48:00,759 --> 00:48:01,267
who were you with?

615
00:48:01,423 --> 00:48:02,033
Alone

616
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:04,431
Alone?

617
00:48:05,212 --> 00:48:06,908
I’m not lying

618
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:10,064
Were you alone before you went to the hotel?

619
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:15,165
Just check the hotel's phone and we'll find it.

620
00:48:16,024 --> 00:48:19,915
Bar's MADAM sells fake whiskey

621
00:48:21,362 --> 00:48:23,604
You are lying.

622
00:48:25,494 --> 00:48:29,260
Not Hatanaka, but our customer

623
00:48:29,604 --> 00:48:30,807
Who's he?

624
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:35,979
Ozeki

625
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:39,010
But he has nothing to do with this

626
00:48:40,815 --> 00:48:42,135
You date with your customer?

627
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,792
Is that bad?

628
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:49,488
From Sanezaki police

629
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:52,301
I'm Kurokawa

630
00:48:55,246 --> 00:48:57,004
Ok I get it

631
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:58,098
What?

632
00:48:59,082 --> 00:49:01,629
He confessed and they were able to locate the killer.

633
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,512
That's good

634
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:03,340
He'll go back

635
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:04,379
I see

636
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:12,111
Sorry to disturb you.
We might ask you to go for the court. Say hello to the Ozaki

637
00:49:15,394 --> 00:49:17,449
You can open your bar

638
00:49:20,613 --> 00:49:21,957
What should we do?

639
00:49:23,402 --> 00:49:25,582
Close the bar today

640
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,957
You guys go home

641
00:49:29,988 --> 00:49:31,965
Excuse me

642
00:49:33,699 --> 00:49:35,480
Pass me the salt

643
00:49:51,877 --> 00:49:55,252
Main suspect in fake whiskey case arrested

644
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:12,337
She is a disgrace to the UTSUMI Society. Our whiskey is also suspect.

645
00:50:12,993 --> 00:50:15,611
Good morning.

646
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,989
Did you really get permitted from Toshiko?

647
00:50:20,419 --> 00:50:25,145
Ishii also asked me about you.
Anyway work hard

648
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,818
I guess you've had the fake whiskeys

649
00:50:32,224 --> 00:50:33,638
It might be so

650
00:50:34,013 --> 00:50:37,318
I don't think she does not know

651
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:40,087
It seems she is selling her bar

652
00:50:40,118 --> 00:50:41,962
It's a tough business

653
00:50:41,987 --> 00:50:46,095
Customers were given fake whiskey to drink.

654
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:48,415
I'm not going to pay for the follow-up payment.

655
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,087
Everyone say that

656
00:50:50,407 --> 00:50:53,595
That's too bad not to pay

657
00:50:54,225 --> 00:50:56,061
We're talking about her bar

658
00:50:56,086 --> 00:50:57,943
She's pity

659
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,779
She's beautiful, but her heart is filthy.

660
00:51:01,287 --> 00:51:04,568
You talk so badly

661
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:06,709
Sorry

662
00:51:06,986 --> 00:51:10,345
Your bar is always busy

663
00:51:11,345 --> 00:51:16,837
The people who moved out of her bar are not like you people.

664
00:51:17,873 --> 00:51:19,021
You talk so badly

665
00:51:19,545 --> 00:51:21,170
We earn from them a lot

666
00:51:22,014 --> 00:51:23,053
Oh my god

667
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:28,404
Many businesses are expanding from Osaka to Tokyo

668
00:51:29,512 --> 00:51:36,613
On the contrary, businesses from Tokyo to Osaka will fail.

669
00:51:36,988 --> 00:51:38,738
I think that's the problem

670
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,348
I have no idea

671
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:45,160
In short, around here, Tokyo style bar is only you

672
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:49,465
So Local people might envy you

673
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,840
I don't wanna think about it

674
00:51:53,263 --> 00:51:56,286
I wanna ask you about the call girl

675
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:57,505
I told you not to talk about it

676
00:51:58,731 --> 00:52:02,583
But write what you want.
It makes PR for our bar

677
00:52:04,117 --> 00:52:07,523
It can't be helped.
Sorry to disturb you

678
00:52:08,671 --> 00:52:09,554
Let's go

679
00:52:10,023 --> 00:52:11,273
Sorry to disturb you

680
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,213
Who's he?

681
00:52:20,299 --> 00:52:21,455
Nothing

682
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,424
Let's open bar

683
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:24,486
Yes

684
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:25,478
Welcome

685
00:52:28,252 --> 00:52:29,392
Thanks

686
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:35,236
It was urgent business

687
00:52:37,038 --> 00:52:40,288
They demanded discounts on store sales.

688
00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:43,616
So much

689
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:47,319
Phone call from Ozaki, Tokyo

690
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:54,265
Hi it's me. I was going to call you

691
00:52:54,828 --> 00:52:56,164
How's the deal?

692
00:52:57,495 --> 00:53:00,690
Can you sell?
How much

693
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:12,658
3 million, I'll negotiate, but 3.5 million is limited

694
00:53:14,405 --> 00:53:20,640
It's too urgent.
The manager of bar does not wanna sell under 4 million

695
00:53:21,374 --> 00:53:23,390
They are 1st class bar

696
00:53:25,476 --> 00:53:27,476
You need to go to Tokyo

697
00:53:29,846 --> 00:53:32,143
People in Tokyo talks about us?

698
00:53:33,916 --> 00:53:37,526
Tokyo people likes such a bar.
Do you wanna see it?

699
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:41,768
Leave it to me?
So I can decide?

700
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:49,900
Don't worry. cheer up.
That's not so you

701
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:04,986
Are you going out?

702
00:54:06,884 --> 00:54:07,946
I need to talk

703
00:54:08,587 --> 00:54:09,407
Talk me later

704
00:54:09,626 --> 00:54:10,923
You gonna lie again?

705
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:12,337
I'm not

706
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:14,775
Now you can't talk about me

707
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,425
What do you mean?

708
00:54:21,065 --> 00:54:24,268
Or something happens?

709
00:54:25,003 --> 00:54:26,268
It's none of your business

710
00:54:28,037 --> 00:54:29,333
I decided not to break up

711
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:32,380
I haven't said that before

712
00:54:33,201 --> 00:54:34,294
You were shocked

713
00:54:35,201 --> 00:54:37,404
Everyone get shocked to read the article

714
00:54:38,944 --> 00:54:41,132
I didn't see the act, so I gonna trust you

715
00:54:43,234 --> 00:54:46,898
People think we are really husband and wife, OK?

716
00:55:29,073 --> 00:55:32,753
What your wife said about us?

717
00:55:33,948 --> 00:55:35,167
It's not your business

718
00:55:35,807 --> 00:55:37,924
I wanna know about it first

719
00:55:39,955 --> 00:55:42,307
I'm glad you came even though you're busy

720
00:55:43,174 --> 00:55:48,034
I cried when you got off the plane from Itami Airport.

721
00:55:49,373 --> 00:55:49,974
You stupid

722
00:55:50,818 --> 00:55:53,498
I was under a lot of pressure

723
00:55:53,756 --> 00:55:55,303
That's not so you

724
00:55:56,176 --> 00:55:59,997
The customer disappeared like the fire went out

725
00:56:00,317 --> 00:56:01,247
Because of whiskey?

726
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:03,708
About me

727
00:56:04,348 --> 00:56:07,254
they found out I had a lover

728
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:09,657
I'm horned

729
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:16,515
I've been putting up with it, but now I want to quit this job.

730
00:56:17,854 --> 00:56:19,112
birds are singing

731
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:24,339
you always say different topics when I'm in trouble

732
00:56:40,195 --> 00:56:44,414
I'm glad I came to Kyoto.
I like this slope

733
00:56:45,281 --> 00:56:47,765
This place is the same as when I came here on a school trip.

734
00:56:48,501 --> 00:56:50,048
here's always quiet

735
00:56:53,181 --> 00:56:55,087
Please don't fall when you go up this slope.

736
00:56:55,431 --> 00:56:56,040
Why?

737
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,900
It is said that if you fall here, you will die in three years.

738
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:04,898
I don't mind dying but I don't want to leave you

739
00:57:24,565 --> 00:57:25,409
It tastes good

740
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:30,557
It's been a while I relax

741
00:57:37,089 --> 00:57:38,604
I hear the temple bell

742
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:41,941
here's always quiet

743
00:57:47,656 --> 00:57:51,741
This is all thanks to that incident.

744
00:57:51,913 --> 00:57:54,265
That might have been a good opportunity to leave Osaka.

745
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,597
How's Ginza bar like?

746
00:57:58,105 --> 00:58:01,331
A little smaller than the current bar

747
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,396
The name is Lizo?
Shall I change the name?

748
00:58:04,475 --> 00:58:06,397
Same name chatole is better

749
00:58:06,639 --> 00:58:08,162
People in Tokyo like unusual things.

750
00:58:09,809 --> 00:58:11,777
I'm worried about whether I can work in Ginza.

751
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:14,145
I know you are confident

752
00:58:14,277 --> 00:58:16,699
Don't make fun of me

753
00:58:16,824 --> 00:58:18,856
Anyway, let's find an apartment in Tokyo

754
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:26,633
what kind of woman am I to you?

755
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:30,201
am I your mistress?

756
00:58:33,764 --> 00:58:36,131
do you want to decide your position clearly?

757
00:58:40,702 --> 00:58:41,709
Excuse me

758
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:44,483
bath ready

759
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:49,053
Please prepare a taxi to itami

760
00:58:49,389 --> 00:58:50,428
I see

761
00:58:52,744 --> 00:58:55,150
I deposited 3 million yen

762
00:58:56,244 --> 00:59:00,556
I will pay the other party as soon as I go to Tokyo.
The remaining 1 million yen will be returned after the store opens.

763
00:59:02,464 --> 00:59:04,706
when will I see you again?

764
00:59:05,956 --> 00:59:09,675
I don't know yet so far

765
00:59:50,881 --> 00:59:52,865
I was surprised that Ozaki was your lover.

766
00:59:55,412 --> 00:59:57,396
You can go home

767
00:59:58,003 --> 00:59:58,878
You get out them?

768
00:59:59,096 --> 01:00:00,425
It's time to close

769
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:02,417
Excuse me

770
01:00:04,205 --> 01:00:04,893
Excuse me

771
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:08,236
please clean up tomorrow

772
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:10,143
This is bookkeeping

773
01:00:13,884 --> 01:00:15,391
Excuse me

774
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:23,251
Please go to the police station tomorrow and give this to Ecchan

775
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,952
he likes this sushi

776
01:00:35,975 --> 01:00:37,897
You can go home too

777
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:40,374
scary mom is waiting for you

778
01:00:41,428 --> 01:00:42,303
I don't care

779
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:43,756
So wife

780
01:00:44,397 --> 01:00:45,616
She's not my wife

781
01:00:46,235 --> 01:00:51,610
she was taken by my mother.
we live together but it's like another world

782
01:00:53,924 --> 01:00:56,932
If you were like you are now, we wouldn't have divorced.

783
01:00:58,291 --> 01:01:06,298
I was born in an ordinary family.
I knew that if I married into your family, I would have a hard time.

784
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:11,298
But I married you because I liked you

785
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:17,080
But you valued your business more than me

786
01:01:19,213 --> 01:01:24,057
I am out of the house now.
I have another job now

787
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:27,369
I couldn't stand your unhappiness

788
01:01:32,464 --> 01:01:36,511
I did bad to you.
I won't blame to Ozeki

789
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:41,335
Can we live together again?

790
01:01:42,562 --> 01:01:46,023
I will return to Tokyo this month and open a shop in Ginza.

791
01:01:47,112 --> 01:01:48,073
Did you sell this bar?

792
01:01:49,784 --> 01:01:51,417
You have been deceived by Mr. Ozaki

793
01:01:51,659 --> 01:01:55,901
I love you so much

794
01:01:58,570 --> 01:02:00,679
It's too late

795
01:02:02,406 --> 01:02:06,148
Please don't go to Tokyo and work with me.

796
01:02:07,535 --> 01:02:10,660
I'm thinking of starting a company that makes bottle crowns.

797
01:02:11,386 --> 01:02:13,175
I think this is good business

798
01:02:14,457 --> 01:02:16,839
Will you invest me about 1 million yen?

799
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,203
I know you have money

800
01:02:23,102 --> 01:02:26,524
I bought a store in Ginza, so I have no money.

801
01:02:30,588 --> 01:02:31,533
Good evening

802
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:33,744
Oh Madam

803
01:02:34,942 --> 01:02:36,505
you're closing the store early

804
01:02:36,724 --> 01:02:37,997
Yes these days

805
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:41,778
I wanted to go to your shop, but I didn't have a chance to come.

806
01:02:44,668 --> 01:02:46,254
I'll come again

807
01:02:47,629 --> 01:02:48,567
Think about it

808
01:02:52,567 --> 01:02:54,356
Your ex husband?

809
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:56,661
Did I disturb you?

810
01:02:56,872 --> 01:02:57,692
No no

811
01:02:59,646 --> 01:03:01,763
You got hard time

812
01:03:03,099 --> 01:03:05,825
I heard that you will open a store in Ginza.

813
01:03:06,498 --> 01:03:08,732
I can't live in Osaka anymore

814
01:03:09,592 --> 01:03:13,139
sometimes bad things happen when you do business

815
01:03:14,036 --> 01:03:22,308
When I started my current business, there were times when customers stopped coming due to various difficulties.

816
01:03:23,613 --> 01:03:27,839
now is the time for you.
Stay strong

817
01:03:28,308 --> 01:03:29,206
Thanks

818
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:34,310
I'm thinking of holding a meeting to console you today.

819
01:03:34,403 --> 01:03:36,716
Mr. Ishii gave the idea

820
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:42,643
He has a foul mouth, but he is very kind-hearted.

821
01:03:43,815 --> 01:03:45,799
I'm sorry I can't go

822
01:03:46,839 --> 01:03:47,432
Why?

823
01:03:48,198 --> 01:03:49,050
I don't feel like

824
01:03:50,714 --> 01:03:51,893
do you still doubt me?

825
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:56,280
do you think I reported to the police?

826
01:04:09,996 --> 01:04:13,059
Come in and talk to her

827
01:04:34,321 --> 01:04:41,782
I'm sorry,
I reported the counterfeit whiskey to the police.

828
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:54,369
When that man deceived me, I thought, but I didn't think it was such a big incident.

829
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:03,316
Do you get it?

830
01:05:04,918 --> 01:05:12,316
She told my bar staff about it last night.
Please forgive her

831
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:21,228
sorry I’m late to tell you

832
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:25,024
Mr.Ishii is playing at a night club now

833
01:05:25,376 --> 01:05:27,525
Shall we go?

834
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:30,369
Sure

835
01:05:42,742 --> 01:05:44,320
Where have you been?

836
01:05:44,898 --> 01:05:46,710
we weren't supposed to interfere with each other

837
01:05:47,296 --> 01:05:51,859
What the hell?
Ozeki Productions may go bankrupt

838
01:05:53,639 --> 01:05:57,069
I received a letter from his manager by airmail.

839
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:03,881
He will be performing in Europe, so he won't be able to come to Japan.

840
01:06:06,083 --> 01:06:09,239
Penalty is only $30,000.
It's too cheap

841
01:06:10,278 --> 01:06:13,778
He will pay the penalty and work on better terms.

842
01:06:14,524 --> 01:06:18,399
After all, it was better to work through an agency in New York as my dad said.

843
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:22,801
Next time I will go to America and speak directly

844
01:06:23,193 --> 01:06:29,974
Damn it.
If he doesn't come, even if I get a penalty, I will lose 10 million yen.

845
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:46,861
Are you Ikuta?

846
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:53,075
My name is Miura, who was introduced to you by Mr. OZEKI about Ginza bar

847
01:06:53,919 --> 01:06:55,989
Welcome. come in

848
01:06:56,068 --> 01:07:01,661
I have to catch the train soon.
I just happen to stop by

849
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:07,688
can I get the money by the end of this month?

850
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:08,946
Money?

851
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,711
You haven't get it yet?

852
01:07:11,516 --> 01:07:15,617
I gave Mr. Ozaki 3 million yen a week ago.

853
01:07:16,657 --> 01:07:24,265
I see.
I would like to cancel if I don't receive the money today or tomorrow.

854
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:28,812
Something wrong.
I'll contact you soon

855
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,390
I will wait till tomorrow

856
01:07:59,524 --> 01:08:00,024
Hi

857
01:08:01,649 --> 01:08:02,821
This is Ozaki Pro

858
01:08:03,461 --> 01:08:05,321
Is Ozaki in?

859
01:08:06,335 --> 01:08:09,257
business trip?
what are his plans?

860
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:11,108
Hold on

861
01:08:11,897 --> 01:08:13,530
A woman is asking the president's business trip schedule.

862
01:08:13,671 --> 01:08:14,483
Who?

863
01:08:15,428 --> 01:08:16,350
From Osaka

864
01:08:19,139 --> 01:08:21,077
Sorry for keeping you waiting

865
01:08:21,623 --> 01:08:25,272
After going to Kobe, he plans to return to Tokyo later today.

866
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:28,597
Who is it?

867
01:08:53,521 --> 01:08:56,779
I'm glad you stayed home.
I got free time

868
01:09:00,515 --> 01:09:04,616
you live in a very nice apartment.
I think it's very expensive here in Tokyo.

869
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:10,812
I'm busy with work and haven't looked for your apartment in Tokyo yet.

870
01:09:11,226 --> 01:09:14,695
Never mind.
You have time today?

871
01:09:16,043 --> 01:09:19,903
I have to go back to Tokyo by the end of today

872
01:09:20,817 --> 01:09:22,098
I can't stay till night

873
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:24,067
I think you were in Kobe

874
01:09:25,309 --> 01:09:26,145
How you know?

875
01:09:26,879 --> 01:09:29,176
I called your office

876
01:09:30,957 --> 01:09:32,801
I heard your wife's voice for the first time

877
01:09:36,389 --> 01:09:38,217
Did you pay that money?

878
01:09:38,412 --> 01:09:39,490
Not yet

879
01:09:39,764 --> 01:09:40,287
Why?

880
01:09:40,522 --> 01:09:43,967
I have to find out before I make a mistake

881
01:09:44,967 --> 01:09:46,186
Oh I see

882
01:09:47,319 --> 01:09:47,936
What's wrong?

883
01:09:48,202 --> 01:09:49,608
Nothing

884
01:09:51,311 --> 01:09:53,600
I got a visa, so I suddenly decided to go to America.

885
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:55,346
So I stopped by

886
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,236
When?

887
01:09:56,619 --> 01:09:57,549
Next week

888
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:05,352
They canceled the contract for the concert in Japan.

889
01:10:06,618 --> 01:10:12,055
If I don't negotiate before it's published, I'll be a failure.

890
01:10:13,405 --> 01:10:15,983
I urgently have to go to America and negotiate.

891
01:10:16,733 --> 01:10:17,819
With your wife?

892
01:10:19,694 --> 01:10:21,295
It might be so

893
01:10:22,155 --> 01:10:23,139
She's helpful

894
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:37,342
What kind of things do you research about bars in Ginza?

895
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:45,176
I met the owner today, but she's confused.

896
01:10:47,224 --> 01:10:48,341
Who?

897
01:10:49,802 --> 01:10:52,146
Madam called Miura

898
01:10:53,896 --> 01:10:55,942
when did you meet her?

899
01:10:57,058 --> 01:11:00,855
Before I left Haneda Airport, I met her around 10 o'clock this morning.

900
01:11:01,995 --> 01:11:03,730
Are you sure?

901
01:11:05,534 --> 01:11:06,425
Yeah

902
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:08,369
Why?

903
01:11:08,737 --> 01:11:10,558
She visited me just before

904
01:11:12,925 --> 01:11:14,745
It seems that she has been at Kobe since last night.

905
01:11:16,495 --> 01:11:18,987
She said that if we don't pay by tomorrow, she will sell the shop to someone else.

906
01:11:28,647 --> 01:11:31,327
why did you tell me it was her this morning?

907
01:11:34,144 --> 01:11:37,113
sorry for lying to you

908
01:11:39,271 --> 01:11:41,903
I'm sorry not to tell you honestly

909
01:11:43,278 --> 01:11:48,325
I had to make amends for breaking the contract.

910
01:11:50,581 --> 01:11:53,167
About 16 million advance tickets have already been sold.

911
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:57,378
Agent found out it

912
01:11:58,151 --> 01:12:03,472
I gave them that 3,000,000 yen for future work.

913
01:12:04,261 --> 01:12:06,355
you should have told me the truth

914
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,605
I thought I could make that money right away

915
01:12:09,097 --> 01:12:15,535
I needed to pay.
But it's okay if I get a penalty

916
01:12:16,737 --> 01:12:20,565
were you going to go to America without leaving me the truth?

917
01:12:21,408 --> 01:12:26,487
I didn't mean that.
I was going to go to Kobe and tell you about it when the problem was solved.

918
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:33,817
I thought you would understand.
There are many bar properties for sale.

919
01:12:34,615 --> 01:12:38,396
My job is a one-time important job

920
01:12:40,513 --> 01:12:42,692
Don't worry about the money

921
01:12:44,005 --> 01:12:45,856
I didn't know you were that kind of person

922
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:55,443
I can live without money

923
01:12:56,422 --> 01:12:59,126
I have no problem giving you 3 million yen.

924
01:13:00,336 --> 01:13:04,422
I’m confused you lied to me

925
01:13:04,844 --> 01:13:06,805
This is for my work

926
01:13:07,987 --> 01:13:13,112
You are a business owner, so you should know the importance of money.

927
01:13:15,522 --> 01:13:19,491
do you really think so?

928
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:23,843
this is how business goes

929
01:13:26,845 --> 01:13:31,196
I understand why you can't divorce your wife

930
01:13:33,221 --> 01:13:40,284
I feel sorry for your wife.
you are using your wife for work

931
01:13:41,659 --> 01:13:43,463
It's none of your business

932
01:13:43,698 --> 01:13:46,065
You’re right

933
01:13:47,921 --> 01:13:52,156
you are me and your wife are stupid

934
01:13:53,968 --> 01:13:56,992
I endured until today

935
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:07,158
I never thought I would part with you like this

936
01:14:12,051 --> 01:14:16,785
I thought you understood my job

937
01:14:37,202 --> 01:14:42,077
thank you so much for taking care of me

938
01:14:43,093 --> 01:14:47,054
are you going home?
Thank you for what you have done

939
01:14:53,241 --> 01:14:57,576
welcome back.
you've had a hard time

940
01:14:58,298 --> 01:14:59,533
thank you

941
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,938
I'm sorry for worrying you

942
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:06,158
You were in detention center but you look fine

943
01:15:06,244 --> 01:15:09,291
I didn't take a bath so I took a bath

944
01:15:09,781 --> 01:15:12,625
Today is the last day, so let's have a comfort party for him.

945
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:13,610
last day?

946
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:15,383
Yeah last day

947
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:21,192
here it is

948
01:15:21,402 --> 01:15:22,481
I want to drink

949
01:15:22,574 --> 01:15:23,684
I want to eat sushi

950
01:15:23,709 --> 01:15:25,215
I want to eat tuna

951
01:15:25,483 --> 01:15:29,764
I thought you bought that whiskey thinking it was fake

952
01:15:30,295 --> 01:15:32,866
Me?
No way

953
01:15:32,912 --> 01:15:35,561
I understand you so much

954
01:15:39,006 --> 01:15:42,873
I was crying while eating sushi in the detention center.

955
01:15:43,358 --> 01:15:46,061
take it easy and have a drink

956
01:15:46,272 --> 01:15:47,467
are you guys drinking?

957
01:15:49,933 --> 01:15:51,425
there's no seats

958
01:15:55,746 --> 01:15:59,660
you are still in Kobe.
I will introduce about her

959
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:03,957
she's my girlfriend.
she's young

960
01:16:05,811 --> 01:16:07,342
take it easy

961
01:16:11,779 --> 01:16:12,904
here it is

962
01:16:13,866 --> 01:16:17,436
I heard you were his ex-wife

963
01:16:18,468 --> 01:16:22,991
I have to tell you I live with him now

964
01:16:23,898 --> 01:16:24,835
See you

965
01:16:26,054 --> 01:16:27,023
What the hell?

966
01:16:41,485 --> 01:16:43,438
thank you

967
01:16:43,656 --> 01:16:45,688
you should stay with her

968
01:16:45,713 --> 01:16:48,267
I'm busy with my boyfriend

969
01:16:48,292 --> 01:16:52,087
what's the a hell that you guys are talking about?
I'm alright

970
01:17:26,407 --> 01:17:27,360
Ozeki

971
01:17:55,628 --> 01:17:56,362
Madam

972
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:02,137
don't stay here

973
01:18:03,535 --> 01:18:04,809
leave me alone

974
01:18:11,669 --> 01:18:14,637
I want to go die

975
01:18:15,106 --> 01:18:17,692
I want to go die

976
01:19:19,314 --> 01:19:20,329
Good morning

977
01:19:21,767 --> 01:19:23,032
you sleep good

978
01:19:31,894 --> 01:19:33,011
why you are upset?

979
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:36,253
sorry but can you go home?

980
01:19:37,831 --> 01:19:39,847
forget about our relationship

981
01:19:41,357 --> 01:19:42,943
it was just happening last night

982
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:49,997
Madam

983
01:19:51,528 --> 01:19:56,958
I’ve always liked you.
I made that incident my own responsibility for you.

984
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:58,216
I know

985
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:05,481
I couldn't stand holding you last night

986
01:20:06,704 --> 01:20:12,313
I was so sad last night

987
01:20:13,548 --> 01:20:16,056
you can laugh at me

988
01:20:19,725 --> 01:20:23,693
I could sleep with anyone who comforted me

989
01:20:24,959 --> 01:20:26,412
I couldn't stand

990
01:20:29,959 --> 01:20:32,467
Did you assume that I was Mr. Ozaki?

991
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:36,974
you are free to think

992
01:20:38,756 --> 01:20:39,443
Madam

993
01:20:40,627 --> 01:20:43,939
I really love you

994
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:46,916
don't tell me anything

995
01:20:49,103 --> 01:20:53,174
forget what happened last night

996
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:28,051
Hello? Madam is there?

997
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:33,062
Unzen in Kyushu

998
01:21:36,718 --> 01:21:38,234
You took long trip

999
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:42,453
I thought you went back in Osaka

1000
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:47,850
I think your money will be back.
I will start again in Osaka if I were you

1001
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,663
I can buy bar in Osaka gain but I worry our reputation

1002
01:21:53,830 --> 01:22:00,143
That's the point.
Osaka people are very sympathetic

1003
01:22:00,690 --> 01:22:03,432
I think they will forget what happens if you work hard

1004
01:22:04,565 --> 01:22:05,675
You can't go halfway.

1005
01:22:05,979 --> 01:22:07,518
But I really worry

1006
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,987
You made good business in Osaka

1007
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:18,221
But I advise you,
Don't fall in love with your customers

1008
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:24,118
Bar women can't love them.
You can't get money from those who you love

1009
01:22:26,798 --> 01:22:32,532
This is your business.
Men are money

1010
01:22:45,421 --> 01:22:47,897
You have a guest?

1011
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:51,319
He's my husband

1012
01:22:53,905 --> 01:22:55,265
She's ex worker, Toshiko

1013
01:22:55,476 --> 01:22:56,991
I'm Toshiko

1014
01:22:57,327 --> 01:22:58,585
Nice to meet you

1015
01:22:59,449 --> 01:23:02,324
Invite her to our room

1016
01:23:06,457 --> 01:23:07,527
How was your walk?

1017
01:23:07,715 --> 01:23:10,137
I got good idea

1018
01:23:10,254 --> 01:23:19,428
Leftover food can be used for pickles, but leftover whiskey can't be used for anything.

1019
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:25,452
But whiskey has alcohol in it, so I think it's worth using.

1020
01:23:26,428 --> 01:23:28,170
I gonna study about it

1021
01:23:28,195 --> 01:23:29,491
That's good

1022
01:23:29,850 --> 01:23:33,405
I plan to bring together university professors to study it.

1023
01:23:35,594 --> 01:23:38,000
It's too hot

1024
01:23:38,344 --> 01:23:41,258
I gonna take a bath

1025
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:53,702
Come here,Toshiko

1026
01:23:58,510 --> 01:24:02,869
Are you surprised?
I thought you found out

1027
01:24:04,603 --> 01:24:09,689
This is who I am, Rie Utsumi

1028
01:24:11,095 --> 01:24:16,306
He supported to open my bar

1029
01:24:17,095 --> 01:24:20,416
Man and woman usually do that

1030
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:31,152
He's popular money lender

1031
01:24:31,931 --> 01:24:33,626
But he is not educated

1032
01:24:35,181 --> 01:24:39,001
You can laugh at him

1033
01:24:41,095 --> 01:24:44,142
Being Bar madam is stupid

1034
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:49,876
I pretend to be nice in Osaka but I need money to the end

1035
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,207
We have to sacrifice something.

1036
01:24:55,849 --> 01:24:58,575
We have to win against men

1037
01:25:00,296 --> 01:25:03,570
Can I work at Utsumi?

1038
01:25:05,538 --> 01:25:07,320
Do you wanna work with me again?

1039
01:25:08,577 --> 01:25:14,031
I wanna start over until I settle down

1040
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:40,963
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I will give the money back

1041
01:25:46,348 --> 01:25:48,879
I'll get them

1042
01:25:59,914 --> 01:26:07,195
I know our relationship is over now

1043
01:26:10,766 --> 01:26:15,016
I'll come back in 5 days if everything goes well

1044
01:26:15,524 --> 01:26:18,477
We should meet again

1045
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:27,263
I had a hard time.
I didn't tell you I wanted to be your wife

1046
01:26:28,758 --> 01:26:32,890
But you were mine in my heart

1047
01:26:35,437 --> 01:26:41,055
I thought to myself that all I needed was to have fun.

1048
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:45,805
It was hard to keep it

1049
01:26:48,587 --> 01:26:55,930
I can no longer live a lie.

1050
01:26:57,079 --> 01:26:59,454
toshiko

1051
01:27:01,485 --> 01:27:02,423
Break up with me

1052
01:27:54,344 --> 01:28:01,602
THE END

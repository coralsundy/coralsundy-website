00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:21,681
Hoodlum Soldier's Escape (#4)

3
00:01:36,983 --> 00:01:37,881
Omiya!

4
00:01:48,696 --> 00:01:50,063
Damn it

5
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:57,581
We are about to over

6
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:05,818
we were charged with desertion

7
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:11,279
We were transported to the Kwantung Army prison in HOTEN

8
00:02:13,164 --> 00:02:16,984
All inmates here are referred to by number.

9
00:02:18,031 --> 00:02:19,078
Arita

10
00:02:20,468 --> 00:02:22,171
You are no.30 from today

11
00:02:24,234 --> 00:02:25,078
Omiya

12
00:02:26,492 --> 00:02:28,460
You are no.31 from today

13
00:02:30,445 --> 00:02:33,960
You must obey the guards' orders.

14
00:02:34,757 --> 00:02:39,070
If you do not obey the guards' orders, you will be punished.

15
00:02:56,839 --> 00:02:58,331
They are new comers

16
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:07,363
Why you are here?

17
00:03:08,168 --> 00:03:09,098
Have you been thieves?

18
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,293
No

19
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:11,613
Run away from military?

20
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:14,199
Yes kind of

21
00:03:14,262 --> 00:03:19,223
A fugitive soldier is worse than a thief.

22
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,371
You all ended up in hell.

23
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:27,305
Don't laugh!

24
00:03:28,396 --> 00:03:29,865
Attention

25
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:32,912
Move forward

26
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:41,696
Stop

27
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:49,611
No.30 enter in no.3 room
No.31 enter in no.4 room

28
00:03:56,332 --> 00:04:01,402
You will be searched when you enter the room.

29
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,324
Take off clothes and get pose

30
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,815
You don't get it?
Take off clothes

31
00:04:14,353 --> 00:04:17,087
unbutton all clothes

32
00:04:18,072 --> 00:04:19,111
Do it quickly!

33
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:25,476
Put your hands up

34
00:04:26,117 --> 00:04:28,101
Open your legs

35
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,109
Open your mouth

36
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:34,094
More!

37
00:04:44,694 --> 00:04:45,944
Ok go in

38
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:51,371
Go!

39
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,811
Don't lie down!

40
00:05:10,907 --> 00:05:12,985
What the hell you are?

41
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:29,429
There are 130 rules here

42
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:34,445
you have to follow the rules

43
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,197
If you understand, answer me.

44
00:05:40,033 --> 00:05:40,572
Yes

45
00:05:41,213 --> 00:05:43,314
Mr. 26, teach him the rules

46
00:05:47,496 --> 00:05:49,301
Just do what I do

47
00:05:51,113 --> 00:05:52,754
do we sit all day?

48
00:05:58,145 --> 00:06:01,957
Place your hands on your knees and sit straight for 30 minutes.

49
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:05,098
If you want to move your hands you need permission from the warden

50
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,832
What do you do when you want to mess with your nostrils?

51
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,370
Yeah

52
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:16,558
this is a very bad place

53
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,917
The warden is right, this place is hell

54
00:06:26,216 --> 00:06:27,623
you seem to have run away

55
00:06:28,427 --> 00:06:28,974
Yes

56
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,724
Which team?

57
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,701
Several teams

58
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:34,060
I did it many times

59
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,028
You are guilty of a great deal.

60
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:39,927
How about you?

61
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,338
I've caused a big problem.

62
00:06:49,674 --> 00:06:50,643
Did you kill anyone?

63
00:06:52,315 --> 00:06:57,057
I stole a lot of guns.

64
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:00,658
you are a thief

65
00:07:03,626 --> 00:07:04,673
Hey!

66
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,045
Don't move your eyes

67
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:14,096
Keep looking at the wall

68
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:17,345
I can't move my eyes?

69
00:07:17,408 --> 00:07:25,207
If you want to do that you need permission from us

70
00:07:25,793 --> 00:07:26,856
No way

71
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:33,243
that's the rule here

72
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,908
Bed time

73
00:08:05,098 --> 00:08:06,731
Go to bed now

74
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:15,801
Hey no.31.
When you go to bed, lie on your back and stretch your legs straight.

75
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:19,932
Do I have to keep my body upright while sleeping?

76
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:22,401
What the hell you are?

77
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:25,479
But it's hard

78
00:08:25,784 --> 00:08:26,596
What?

79
00:08:27,026 --> 00:08:28,229
Respect me

80
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:29,776
don't complain to him

81
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:33,872
Ok then I will go to bed

82
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:41,177
i have a bad sleep.
I don't know after sleeping

83
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:42,755
Good night

84
00:08:45,419 --> 00:08:47,270
he's a trouble maker

85
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:04,414
Wake up!

86
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,610
my towel is a little small

87
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,977
It's same

88
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,290
they are stingy

89
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:40,689
There is a risk that general towels will be used for escape or suicide

90
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:42,703
Escape?

91
00:09:44,656 --> 00:09:48,289
Some people have committed suicide, but no one has yet escaped using a towel.

92
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,981
Attention

93
00:09:52,965 --> 00:09:54,700
Damn it

94
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,895
We're lined up

95
00:10:05,075 --> 00:10:07,552
Number!
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8

96
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:09,802
That's all

97
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,342
Attention

98
00:10:19,306 --> 00:10:21,853
There are no abnormalities in the four people in this room.

99
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,845
Number!
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8

100
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,099
Again

101
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:31,685
Number!
1.2.3.4.5.6.....

102
00:10:34,349 --> 00:10:35,084
Again

103
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,498
Number!
1.2.3.4.5.6.

104
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:40,177
7

105
00:10:40,756 --> 00:10:41,974
Shiina director

106
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,420
He don't follow the rules

107
00:10:56,592 --> 00:11:00,443
Move forward

108
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:04,725
1200

109
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:42,003
Go around

110
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,964
1300

111
00:12:38,265 --> 00:12:42,228
Go around

112
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:47,603
What are you doing?

113
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,835
1600

114
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,429
Good

115
00:13:05,222 --> 00:13:07,136
Get in the jail, No.31

116
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:13,769
Be sure to get permission before entering the room

117
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:18,535
stand up right and ask me for permission

118
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,934
Don't look down about me

119
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,075
Stay down

120
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:53,508
Stop it

121
00:13:58,665 --> 00:13:59,250
Omiya

122
00:14:22,645 --> 00:14:29,887
You are further charged with destruction of property for defying me and reducing my lunch for ten days from today.

123
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,161
Lunch time

124
00:15:04,295 --> 00:15:06,350
Come, No.26

125
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:16,998
the government sent you a package

126
00:15:18,081 --> 00:15:22,057
I will open this package in front of you

127
00:15:31,492 --> 00:15:32,343
A photo

128
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:38,414
She's nice.
Who's she?

129
00:15:39,687 --> 00:15:42,172
My wife,Hisako

130
00:15:44,766 --> 00:15:47,469
Shouldn't you let your wife know you're here?

131
00:15:48,711 --> 00:15:49,984
i didn't want to worry her

132
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,211
You're kind

133
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:52,656
She's nice

134
00:15:52,914 --> 00:15:54,406
Don't pretend you are nice

135
00:15:55,178 --> 00:15:56,577
i won't give you this picture

136
00:15:58,397 --> 00:16:03,256
I only give you tissue paper

137
00:16:04,225 --> 00:16:05,928
I'll keep rest of them

138
00:16:10,676 --> 00:16:12,012
Thanks

139
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:20,403
Please use other

140
00:16:22,466 --> 00:16:24,661
Ok I get them

141
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,242
why do you sell him flattery?

142
00:16:44,265 --> 00:16:45,812
i hate your attitude

143
00:16:46,624 --> 00:16:48,492
It's more profitable for me to do that

144
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:50,993
You should do same

145
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:53,696
I can't

146
00:16:54,665 --> 00:16:59,141
you should follow me.
It's no use resisting them

147
00:17:01,266 --> 00:17:04,641
I don't care if I can't eat

148
00:17:24,658 --> 00:17:25,775
Take this

149
00:17:51,122 --> 00:17:52,989
No.26,get out!

150
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:10,193
Army Private Sawamura Jiro. You have been charged with theft.

151
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:14,529
You had your indictment withdrawn on June 11.

152
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,529
Come back to the army tomorrow morning

153
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:23,417
Am I going to be released?

154
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,550
Thank you very much

155
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:35,112
Your case was decided by a court-martial.

156
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:38,860
I was in charge of it

157
00:18:39,430 --> 00:18:40,563
I know

158
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:44,610
i would like to thank you

159
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,772
You're welcome

160
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:53,834
If you want to get out of prison too, become a feudal lord like Mr. 26.

161
00:18:54,944 --> 00:18:56,553
the solicitor is waiting for you.
Let's go

162
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:27,532
How are you?

163
00:19:27,938 --> 00:19:30,953
I'm fine but you do eat lunch and dinner

164
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:35,496
I want sake and women other than eating

165
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,644
Don't push yourself too hard

166
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,277
If you get along with the guards, you'll be able to leave early.

167
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:42,082
Don't say bullshit

168
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,457
No.26 got out

169
00:19:45,582 --> 00:19:50,879
Listen.
Our case is not easy

170
00:19:51,787 --> 00:19:53,443
we are fugitives

171
00:19:55,686 --> 00:19:56,756
So what will happens?

172
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:00,426
we will be killed

173
00:20:01,989 --> 00:20:03,403
Really?

174
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,942
Or life imprisonment

175
00:20:08,698 --> 00:20:11,698
we have to jailbreak

176
00:20:19,034 --> 00:20:21,682
Go to bed

177
00:20:36,441 --> 00:20:38,168
this is broken

178
00:20:38,285 --> 00:20:39,988
water pipe is rising

179
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:40,902
What should I do?

180
00:20:41,129 --> 00:20:43,848
call the guard quickly

181
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:46,301
guard!

182
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:48,465
Broken water pipe.

183
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,614
Did you make it?

184
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:51,793
What did do do?

185
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,145
Stop it any way

186
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:58,122
Please close the main valve

187
00:20:58,411 --> 00:21:00,395
Matsumoto,close the main valve

188
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:02,942
We can't sleep

189
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:10,802
Fuck you

190
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,518
you plan to escape

191
00:21:29,237 --> 00:21:30,174
Keep quiet

192
00:21:34,124 --> 00:21:34,749
Stop it

193
00:21:36,311 --> 00:21:38,350
Don't move

194
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:41,231
Calm down, Omiya

195
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:46,192
I know

196
00:23:08,827 --> 00:23:10,171
There is no problem!

197
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,725
Thanks for your work

198
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:40,109
Let's run and break through.

199
00:23:40,898 --> 00:23:41,773
We can't

200
00:23:42,218 --> 00:23:45,593
If we run and break through, they can't see us

201
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:48,555
Leave it to me

202
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:56,243
Attention

203
00:23:59,009 --> 00:23:59,782
Hold on

204
00:24:04,489 --> 00:24:05,278
Where are you going?

205
00:24:06,411 --> 00:24:09,114
There's a sudden illness. I'm going to call a doctor.

206
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,099
There's a sudden illness?

207
00:24:10,192 --> 00:24:10,567
Yes

208
00:24:11,247 --> 00:24:11,997
Which room?

209
00:24:12,364 --> 00:24:13,653
No.1 room

210
00:24:28,253 --> 00:24:29,527
I don't see an armband.

211
00:24:31,363 --> 00:24:37,418
It's urgent business.
The warden said he would call you later.

212
00:24:38,893 --> 00:24:39,525
I see

213
00:24:42,244 --> 00:24:42,705
OK

214
00:24:43,478 --> 00:24:44,018
Thanks

215
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:52,765
Hold on

216
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:57,882
Come

217
00:25:16,719 --> 00:25:21,532
Can you get alcohol from there?

218
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:24,751
Don't tell them I want it

219
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:28,196
I know

220
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:29,985
Hold on

221
00:25:47,206 --> 00:25:48,081
Stop

222
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:04,119
You guys!

223
00:26:27,067 --> 00:26:29,028
Hold on, Omiya

224
00:26:32,483 --> 00:26:33,249
Ok let's go!

225
00:26:53,581 --> 00:26:54,823
This is rail line

226
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:56,972
Manshu rail line?

227
00:26:57,878 --> 00:27:00,081
Wait here and get on the train

228
00:27:00,106 --> 00:27:03,237
We can escape if we get on the train

229
00:27:05,146 --> 00:27:06,763
They don't chase us

230
00:27:08,677 --> 00:27:11,982
We made it!

231
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:17,026
I got hungry now

232
00:27:19,964 --> 00:27:20,604
Omiya

233
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:25,571
We'll shoot you if you run away

234
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:27,790
Stop

235
00:27:32,493 --> 00:27:35,696
Everyone who escapes from prison comes here.

236
00:27:47,288 --> 00:27:53,163
The jailbreak failed and we were to be gunned down.

237
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:11,458
You're Arita and Omiya

238
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:16,554
You've already known it

239
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:19,234
Give him a proper reply.

240
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:26,351
Do not interrogate him and execute him immediately.

241
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:30,554
We need the procedure.

242
00:28:32,015 --> 00:28:33,937
You wait outside

243
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:58,918
Arita,It's me

244
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,186
You're Nagai

245
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:07,389
Yes

246
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:09,241
Long time no see

247
00:29:09,272 --> 00:29:10,397
Since we graduated the college

248
00:29:11,264 --> 00:29:13,498
Are you now a lieutenant in law?

249
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:18,147
I was surprised to learn that you are a fugitive from justice.

250
00:29:19,123 --> 00:29:21,967
He's my classmate

251
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:26,194
Hello.
Could you please untie this too?

252
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:28,069
You stay as it is

253
00:29:31,836 --> 00:29:35,539
You have caused us a great deal of trouble.

254
00:29:39,953 --> 00:29:41,062
We know we are condemned to death.

255
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,280
I'm glad to see you

256
00:29:46,998 --> 00:29:50,061
You know how I feel

257
00:29:50,459 --> 00:29:52,139
I save you

258
00:29:54,567 --> 00:30:00,754
I will make sure you do not get the death penalty.

259
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:03,559
Are you sure?

260
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,499
I'll deal with them

261
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,218
Is there a deal for a court-martial?

262
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:13,296
Kind of

263
00:30:14,444 --> 00:30:17,538
You may be transferred to a front-line unit.

264
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,710
It's better than die

265
00:30:21,749 --> 00:30:24,842
Don't run away and ruin my face again

266
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,077
I won't

267
00:30:26,624 --> 00:30:30,678
Excuse me but can you help me too?

268
00:30:31,194 --> 00:30:32,124
I don't know

269
00:30:35,303 --> 00:30:39,764
You are the main offender, so it is not the same

270
00:30:43,866 --> 00:30:44,850
what will happen to him?

271
00:30:45,397 --> 00:30:46,405
I have no idea

272
00:30:47,671 --> 00:30:52,155
he has to take the responsibility

273
00:30:52,645 --> 00:30:56,114
i am responsible for everything

274
00:30:56,661 --> 00:30:58,536
he is my subordinate

275
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:02,017
he obeyed my orders

276
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,407
But...

277
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,157
Please help him too

278
00:31:11,306 --> 00:31:12,650
I know how you feel

279
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:16,970
I think you should cut ties

280
00:31:18,715 --> 00:31:23,442
I can't.
If he can't be saved, I will stay here.

281
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:30,549
me and him have always acted together

282
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:36,633
Nagai

283
00:31:38,453 --> 00:31:39,039
Please

284
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:53,554
We saved our life

285
00:32:02,274 --> 00:32:06,360
We were transferred to the unit going to CHANGKOTSU.

286
00:32:07,022 --> 00:32:15,528
But only we were sent further to the front line

287
00:32:16,848 --> 00:32:20,020
I downgraded

288
00:32:21,827 --> 00:32:24,843
We always have something to do with the military, don't we?

289
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,390
Get ready!

290
00:33:02,793 --> 00:33:05,996
do we get off here too?

291
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:07,277
Get off?

292
00:33:08,074 --> 00:33:09,894
Let's have fun

293
00:33:10,957 --> 00:33:11,949
Don't say bullshit

294
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,762
no one is watching us

295
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:21,074
But I worry about Nagai

296
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:01,434
She's here

297
00:34:04,614 --> 00:34:05,731
Stop it

298
00:34:07,083 --> 00:34:08,153
Don't run away

299
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:12,098
Come with me

300
00:34:12,536 --> 00:34:13,684
What are you saying?

301
00:34:14,426 --> 00:34:16,958
i will be loud if you touch me

302
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:19,640
You are already adult

303
00:34:21,672 --> 00:34:22,453
Stay down

304
00:34:22,539 --> 00:34:23,796
What the hell you are

305
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:25,920
You're just woman

306
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:27,967
Stop it

307
00:34:29,381 --> 00:34:30,068
Stay down

308
00:34:34,092 --> 00:34:35,576
She hates it

309
00:34:37,155 --> 00:34:38,272
Which teak are you belonging ?

310
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:39,850
It's none of your business

311
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:44,905
Do you know who I am?

312
00:34:46,623 --> 00:34:47,904
i am an officer

313
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:50,857
i will punish you

314
00:34:51,521 --> 00:34:53,646
we're on the train

315
00:34:54,974 --> 00:34:56,779
Go outside if you play woman

316
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,544
Fuck you

317
00:35:01,223 --> 00:35:02,919
Cut it out!

318
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,506
get out!

319
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:07,256
Damn it

320
00:35:22,233 --> 00:35:23,647
he's bustard

321
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:28,131
Sit here if you like

322
00:35:29,676 --> 00:35:30,903
I feel relieved

323
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:35,497
He is a guest I met at a banquet.

324
00:35:36,528 --> 00:35:37,887
He's annoying

325
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:40,347
Where are you going to?

326
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:41,926
To xinkatong

327
00:35:43,066 --> 00:35:44,707
We're going too

328
00:35:45,058 --> 00:35:46,160
I see

329
00:35:46,449 --> 00:35:48,308
We're transferred there

330
00:35:48,386 --> 00:35:51,620
I work at a small restaurant there

331
00:35:52,324 --> 00:35:54,129
I'm Tamako

332
00:35:54,909 --> 00:35:56,886
Please visit me

333
00:35:56,965 --> 00:35:58,816
i want to thank you

334
00:36:00,823 --> 00:36:04,393
I'm excited.
Let's go to her shop tonight

335
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:05,784
private first class

336
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:07,605
You are just first class

337
00:36:08,986 --> 00:36:11,626
I had a lot of circumstances.

338
00:36:13,001 --> 00:36:14,392
Where are you from?

339
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:19,295
We were in the HOTEN Special Forces

340
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:20,124
HOTEN

341
00:36:20,858 --> 00:36:24,639
I worked there as a geisha for about two and a half years.

342
00:36:25,124 --> 00:36:28,069
After that, I went to XINKYO and Harbin.

343
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,577
we work in many places

344
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:35,538
soldiers are like you

345
00:36:52,773 --> 00:36:54,882
Thanks for coming

346
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:59,242
where did you take a detour?

347
00:37:00,046 --> 00:37:01,210
Train was late

348
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:03,054
don't make excuses

349
00:37:05,729 --> 00:37:09,245
You guys went to the whorehouse.

350
00:37:10,104 --> 00:37:12,018
Do you bet if we go or not?

351
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:12,839
What?

352
00:37:15,212 --> 00:37:17,884
Look at our bodies and you'll see

353
00:37:19,063 --> 00:37:21,376
you shouldn't be arrogant

354
00:37:23,228 --> 00:37:25,681
The troops here are tough.

355
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,407
Your face is like a rock

356
00:37:37,572 --> 00:37:41,650
sleep in an empty room

357
00:37:42,316 --> 00:37:42,972
Mt.private first class

359
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:46,246
Not you. but him

360
00:37:47,027 --> 00:37:49,496
private first class?
He is just first class

361
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:51,121
He was private first class

362
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:52,433
how old are you?

363
00:37:52,676 --> 00:37:53,574

366
00:38:12,108 --> 00:38:13,944
Give me one

367
00:38:16,209 --> 00:38:16,670
What?

368
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:17,741
What?

369
00:38:19,516 --> 00:38:20,618
You're no.26

370
00:38:22,407 --> 00:38:24,532
You're 31

371
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:28,659
how did you get out of prison?

372
00:38:28,684 --> 00:38:30,198
He's my boss

373
00:38:30,971 --> 00:38:32,159
I know

374
00:38:32,862 --> 00:38:35,307
Thanks for looking after him

375
00:38:36,253 --> 00:38:39,901
We're related, aren't we?

376
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:43,761
Do you have drinking?

377
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:46,120
you guys go to bed early

378
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:54,626
we were redone from basic training

379
00:39:06,978 --> 00:39:07,650
Omiya

380
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:12,189
Say the 5 articles of a soldier

381
00:39:13,064 --> 00:39:15,674
1.soldiers should be punished

382
00:39:15,877 --> 00:39:17,095
It's wrong

383
00:39:18,885 --> 00:39:20,619
1.soldiers should be

384
00:39:22,908 --> 00:39:27,135
1.soldiers must be loyal

385
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,430
should be text

386
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:32,086
This is not a song

387
00:39:33,617 --> 00:39:37,641
1.soldiers behave themselves

388
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:39,289
It's courtesy

389
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:45,649
1.soldiers take their lives...I forget

390
00:39:46,336 --> 00:39:49,227
You know nothing

391
00:39:50,368 --> 00:39:51,868
Attention

392
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,018
23 people gathered

393
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:09,589
Number!
1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10.11.12.13.14.15.16.17.18.19.20.21.22.23

394
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,058
There's no problem

395
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:16,563
Attention

396
00:40:18,907 --> 00:40:23,274
We will be dispatched to KANSHU in the near future.

397
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:28,553
our mission is very important

398
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,262
Was this how it worked?

399
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:45,973
We have no choice but to do it this way

400
00:40:46,262 --> 00:40:49,559
Don't you remember Iroha from SONBU?

401
00:40:50,629 --> 00:40:52,301
Otomaru's room were like this

402
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,207
Who's she?

403
00:40:53,379 --> 00:40:57,957
I met her there.
Let's have a heso sake

404
00:40:58,606 --> 00:41:01,652
Heso sake?
We don't have that

405
00:41:01,871 --> 00:41:04,160
There is only sake or beer

406
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:06,285
Give me a beer

407
00:41:08,284 --> 00:41:09,659
I'll bring some

408
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:16,473
It's killing me

409
00:41:23,993 --> 00:41:25,798
Can you stay out tonight?

410
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:27,384
we will be back by dinner

411
00:41:28,298 --> 00:41:31,626
We'll work at Kanshu from tomorrow

412
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,769
kanshu?

413
00:41:38,152 --> 00:41:40,214
So I won't see you

414
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:48,143
Thanks for coming.
Let's toast

415
00:41:52,549 --> 00:41:54,339
I'll please you

416
00:41:58,881 --> 00:42:00,146
Really?

417
00:42:04,138 --> 00:42:05,123
Where's Tamako?

418
00:42:05,295 --> 00:42:07,303
She's with her customer

419
00:42:10,225 --> 00:42:10,967
I see

420
00:42:12,092 --> 00:42:13,475
Can you take care of me?

421
00:42:29,866 --> 00:42:36,986
I think I'm the only one who went out today

422
00:42:38,978 --> 00:42:40,166
Who's the customer?

423
00:42:40,783 --> 00:42:42,916
It's a soldier

424
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:45,041
soldier?

425
00:42:49,174 --> 00:42:51,260
Heso Sake is what you mean

426
00:42:51,814 --> 00:42:53,908
My stomach hurts when I drink beer through my belly button

427
00:42:54,076 --> 00:42:55,678
bring me a warm beer

428
00:42:56,256 --> 00:42:57,600
i get burned

429
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:00,106
my stomach is sensitive

430
00:43:06,073 --> 00:43:07,385
Team leader

431
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:09,651
Oh you

432
00:43:11,393 --> 00:43:13,198
do you know where this is?

433
00:43:15,674 --> 00:43:18,760
This is the store where officers come

434
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:21,411
This is not the store where you come

435
00:43:21,763 --> 00:43:26,161
If you take off your clothes, you are all the same

436
00:43:27,198 --> 00:43:28,776
did you know from the beginning?

437
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:37,104
i haven't had sex with them yet

438
00:43:38,158 --> 00:43:39,971
They are my best friend

439
00:43:40,729 --> 00:43:41,479
best friend?

440
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:45,268
Even if they're best friends, they can't be here

441
00:43:46,221 --> 00:43:48,370
Get out!

442
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:54,337
What should we do?

443
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:00,821
Don't look down at me

444
00:44:02,665 --> 00:44:04,079
Please go back

445
00:44:07,477 --> 00:44:08,563
We'll go back

446
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:16,556
Go back

447
00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:23,634
Omiya

448
00:44:28,384 --> 00:44:29,204
Damn it

449
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:32,736
I hate him

450
00:44:33,181 --> 00:44:35,618
It can't be helped

451
00:44:37,704 --> 00:44:39,267
I can't accept

452
00:44:45,707 --> 00:44:48,293
what are you going to do?

453
00:45:24,469 --> 00:45:27,579
they were in prison

454
00:45:27,626 --> 00:45:28,618
I don't care

455
00:45:29,048 --> 00:45:29,688
Don't deal with them

456
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,102
Are you jealous?

457
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:34,548
They are just soldiers

458
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:36,967
Tamako?

459
00:45:37,162 --> 00:45:37,975
What?

460
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,959
You're cold to me

461
00:45:43,701 --> 00:45:44,865
Don't get angry

462
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,865
I'll please you

463
00:45:52,668 --> 00:45:55,707
it's mouses

464
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,598
it's mouses

465
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,349
Attention

466
00:46:13,951 --> 00:46:15,490
departs at 8am

467
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,474
Walk east for about 10 kilometers

468
00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:26,342
It's a place that's at odds with the Soviet Union.

469
00:46:27,388 --> 00:46:30,779
There are 4 monitoring stations every 300 M

470
00:46:31,381 --> 00:46:34,428
We'll handle the first monitoring stations

471
00:46:36,107 --> 00:46:38,482
I will use a map to explain to you

472
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:55,419
why are you laughing?
Come to my room later

473
00:47:09,310 --> 00:47:11,497
did you reflect?

474
00:47:13,485 --> 00:47:15,446
Tamako is my girl

475
00:47:16,523 --> 00:47:18,375
i will take her back to japan

476
00:47:19,266 --> 00:47:21,360
don't get involved with her

477
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:26,167
Stand up!

478
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:30,651
Do you rebel?

479
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:36,243
If I report you, your parole will be revoked.

480
00:47:37,351 --> 00:47:40,108
you will go to jail again

481
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,702
You want me to do that?

482
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,390
You want me to do that?

483
00:48:16,572 --> 00:48:20,174
sorry to bother you

484
00:48:22,892 --> 00:48:27,259
you endured well.
i thought you would hit him

485
00:48:29,274 --> 00:48:32,032
He's so nasty

486
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,857
he is very sneaky

487
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:43,388
Of all the superiors I've met, who I hate the most.

488
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:46,770
we will get revenge on him

489
00:49:10,592 --> 00:49:12,404
Oh you

490
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:14,936
What's wrong?

491
00:49:15,506 --> 00:49:16,358
Nothing

492
00:49:16,811 --> 00:49:18,514
you have something

493
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:19,944
Did you see?

494
00:49:20,944 --> 00:49:22,694
Money or gold?

495
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:24,490
Gold?

496
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:27,592
don't hide it, show me

497
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:31,211
Stone

498
00:49:31,992 --> 00:49:32,578
Stone?

499
00:49:33,769 --> 00:49:36,652
Jade
i have been saving them till now

500
00:49:38,162 --> 00:49:39,357
How did you get them?

501
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,826
I traded this for what I stole

502
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:46,889
are you going to take it away?

503
00:49:47,459 --> 00:49:49,818
No way.
I'm not that person

504
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:55,959
I am grateful to you for the meals you gave me in prison.

505
00:49:58,092 --> 00:49:59,451
Can you keep a secret?

506
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:04,128
I will sell this and go back to Japan just in case

507
00:50:05,753 --> 00:50:10,206
I will die after loving Hisako

508
00:50:54,141 --> 00:50:57,532
I was told there were female soldiers in the Soviet Union.

509
00:50:59,485 --> 00:51:01,087
This is front line

510
00:51:02,712 --> 00:51:10,500
I was told that the Soviets sent all their male soldiers to Germany.

511
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,891
I'm guessing there are one female soldier at least

512
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:19,914
You're happy man

513
00:51:21,891 --> 00:51:25,281
You think of nothing but women

514
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,008
It can't be helped

515
00:51:29,399 --> 00:51:32,406
I think of Japan all the way

516
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,266
I miss Japan

517
00:51:43,411 --> 00:51:49,887
We've worked for returning to Japan

518
00:51:51,466 --> 00:51:52,583
We've tried to escape

519
00:51:54,505 --> 00:51:58,645
But we ended up to be front line

520
00:52:00,263 --> 00:52:03,184
I was told there were female soldiers who swim in the river

521
00:52:04,583 --> 00:52:06,013
They are kidding

522
00:52:20,082 --> 00:52:22,785
Someone go to the riverbank and get a duck.

523
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:27,207
I'll give you a gun. get closer and shoot them

524
00:52:29,458 --> 00:52:30,809
Who wanna go?

525
00:52:35,174 --> 00:52:37,283
Are you afraid about soldiers in the Soviet Union?

526
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:40,658
You guys are so chicken

527
00:52:42,604 --> 00:52:45,268
Are you freaking out,Omiya?

528
00:52:51,275 --> 00:52:53,861
You are a coward after all.

529
00:52:55,643 --> 00:52:58,354
Why you afraid of being shot?

530
00:53:02,033 --> 00:53:08,509
I'm going. but If I managed it, can you let me go out?

531
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:11,354
Ok I'll let you

532
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:13,158
I'm going.

533
00:53:16,847 --> 00:53:19,855
Don't go.
You'll get shot

534
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:23,097
They are snipers.

535
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,870
You wanna go?

536
00:53:27,542 --> 00:53:28,409
I'm going.

537
00:53:29,823 --> 00:53:33,206
We'll shoot if they shoot

538
00:53:34,151 --> 00:53:38,245
It could turn into a war.

539
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:42,308
I'll see how they work

540
00:53:43,636 --> 00:53:45,808
Don't play it

541
00:53:46,972 --> 00:53:50,464
You know who I am?

542
00:53:52,651 --> 00:53:54,355
Don't worry about me

543
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,425
You are fat so easy to target

544
00:53:59,799 --> 00:54:04,846
Yakuza tried to shoot me. but They couldn't shoot me.

545
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:08,815
They are snipers.

546
00:54:11,011 --> 00:54:11,823
See how it goes

547
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:48,819
It was close

548
00:57:27,347 --> 00:57:28,714
I got 2

549
00:57:29,565 --> 00:57:32,925
We'll have duck hot pot meal tonight

550
00:57:35,648 --> 00:57:37,351
I'll go out

551
00:57:37,741 --> 00:57:40,570
But don't see Tamako

552
00:57:42,054 --> 00:57:42,827
Answer

553
00:57:44,609 --> 00:57:45,077
Yes

554
00:57:52,413 --> 00:57:53,366
Mr.Private first solider

555
00:57:55,116 --> 00:57:55,647
You stupid

556
00:58:11,852 --> 00:58:14,688
Hey, I'm here

557
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:17,595
Welcome

558
00:58:17,735 --> 00:58:18,376
Where's Tamako?

559
00:58:18,946 --> 00:58:20,399
She's gone to officers' living quarters?

560
00:58:20,673 --> 00:58:21,860
officers' living quarters?

561
00:58:22,392 --> 00:58:24,282
There is a party

562
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:26,556
You don't go?

563
00:58:27,298 --> 00:58:28,509
I feel sick

564
00:58:29,337 --> 00:58:30,563
I don't care

565
00:58:34,306 --> 00:58:35,899
This is Tamako's room

566
00:58:38,954 --> 00:58:41,431
You wanna drink?

567
00:59:05,077 --> 00:59:07,327
Sawamura is here.
May I come in?

568
00:59:08,178 --> 00:59:09,350
Come in

569
00:59:15,110 --> 00:59:16,946
Have a seat

570
00:59:25,832 --> 00:59:30,363
I have a favor of you

571
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:39,959
Omiya went out tonight.
I told him not to see Tamako but I can't trust him

572
00:59:40,858 --> 00:59:43,053
Can you check him?

573
00:59:44,959 --> 00:59:46,990
It's easy

574
00:59:47,015 --> 00:59:47,842
just check

575
00:59:49,022 --> 00:59:53,037
it'll be after 11pm if you go now

576
00:59:54,303 --> 00:59:56,756
so You can stay there tonight

577
00:59:57,334 --> 00:59:59,420
Thank you very much

578
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:02,256
But be sure to come back by morning

579
01:00:03,467 --> 01:00:06,772
Don't tell to other solders

580
01:00:07,623 --> 01:00:08,397
I know

581
01:00:11,673 --> 01:00:12,274
Go

582
01:00:13,548 --> 01:00:15,196
I'm going

583
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:02,126
Hold on,Sawamura

584
01:01:11,236 --> 01:01:11,806
What can I do for you?

585
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:19,064
I know you have jade

586
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:24,814
you buried them in the ground

587
01:01:27,281 --> 01:01:29,711
do you think i don't know that?

588
01:01:33,086 --> 01:01:33,976
How did you get them?

589
01:01:35,628 --> 01:01:36,534
Did you steel?

590
01:01:37,847 --> 01:01:38,964
No

591
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:42,636
you cheated and got it

592
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:44,651
Someone gave me

593
01:01:45,862 --> 01:01:47,776
do you want to go to jail again?

594
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:55,769
If you don't want to go to jail again give it to me.

595
01:02:01,447 --> 01:02:04,259
Follow me and I will not tell anyone else.

596
01:02:26,338 --> 01:02:28,424
It's a gunshot.
enemy?

597
01:02:30,034 --> 01:02:30,901
I'm going

598
01:02:54,035 --> 01:02:56,340
Team leader

599
01:03:44,388 --> 01:03:45,099
Team leader

600
01:03:47,028 --> 01:03:47,661
What?

601
01:03:48,513 --> 01:03:50,528
There was a gunshot.

602
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,614
I shot Sawamura

603
01:03:54,646 --> 01:03:56,083
Take his corpse to the observation post.

604
01:04:27,678 --> 01:04:33,178
when i came here late last night

605
01:04:33,818 --> 01:04:35,389
I found out Sawamura went out

606
01:04:36,576 --> 01:04:40,107
When I asked him where he was going, he ran away.

607
01:04:42,201 --> 01:04:44,350
He tried to escape

608
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:50,498
So I shot Sawamura

609
01:04:52,551 --> 01:04:58,863
As you know, if you escape, you'll be shot.

610
01:05:03,016 --> 01:05:08,453
This is the front line of the battlefield

611
01:05:11,305 --> 01:05:15,399
i didn't want to kill him but i had no choice

612
01:05:16,453 --> 01:05:17,891
this is a military rule

613
01:05:19,607 --> 01:05:20,287
Arita

614
01:05:22,005 --> 01:05:22,505
Yes

615
01:05:27,357 --> 01:05:29,263
you were with him in prison

616
01:05:30,834 --> 01:05:31,482
Yes

617
01:05:32,334 --> 01:05:34,638
you deliver his body to the second team

618
01:05:38,963 --> 01:05:44,400
I shot him dead according to military regulations.

619
01:05:47,721 --> 01:05:49,604
He has wife

620
01:05:52,377 --> 01:05:57,260
Treat him as a dead man, not a fugitive.

621
01:05:59,729 --> 01:06:02,573
I will write a letter to the captain, so bring it with you.

622
01:06:03,182 --> 01:06:03,596
Yes

623
01:06:13,924 --> 01:06:18,072
Mr.private first class solider

624
01:06:21,366 --> 01:06:22,585
What's wrong?

625
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:25,624
Sawamura was killed

626
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,024
I deliver his body to the second team

627
01:06:43,554 --> 01:06:44,554
Why he killed

628
01:06:44,976 --> 01:06:47,320
He tried to escape.
So leader shot Sawamura

629
01:06:48,007 --> 01:06:48,351
When?

630
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:49,695
last night

631
01:06:52,523 --> 01:06:57,343
i don't think he escaped

632
01:06:58,708 --> 01:06:59,380
What do you think?

633
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:01,513
It's strange

634
01:07:02,591 --> 01:07:03,825
I'm going too

635
01:07:04,981 --> 01:07:05,981
You have to go back

636
01:07:07,294 --> 01:07:08,442
He looked after me

637
01:07:14,806 --> 01:07:18,415
This is really stupid.

638
01:07:20,714 --> 01:07:24,753
We escaped a lot, but we weren't killed.

639
01:07:25,925 --> 01:07:28,699
Only stupid things happen here

640
01:07:30,613 --> 01:07:34,386
I feel sorry for him

641
01:07:36,034 --> 01:07:40,597
I am so sorry he is gone.

642
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:44,124
he has jade...

643
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:45,382
he has jade...?

644
01:07:48,257 --> 01:07:50,382
He'd saved them

645
01:07:51,538 --> 01:07:52,600
Is it jewelry?

646
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:58,546
he put it in a small bag.
He said he would sell it and go back to Japan.

647
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:05,511
I checked his belongings and found nothing of them

648
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:12,347
he can't run away without them

649
01:08:16,602 --> 01:08:17,962
The leader took them

650
01:08:19,485 --> 01:08:22,446
He may have intended it from the beginning

651
01:08:23,852 --> 01:08:26,555
he killed him as a fugitive

652
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:30,618
Hold on

653
01:08:31,618 --> 01:08:35,087
He is not worth pursuing.

654
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:36,688
Damn it

655
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,813
We need the proof

656
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:41,478
Be careful

657
01:08:44,407 --> 01:08:45,750
Omiya

658
01:09:05,002 --> 01:09:07,736
I feel like drinking today

659
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,056
I treat you nice

660
01:09:09,564 --> 01:09:10,674
I can't get drunk

661
01:09:12,752 --> 01:09:13,916
Because of Sawamura?

662
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:15,611
No

663
01:09:18,034 --> 01:09:19,886
I feel depressed when I see you

664
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:22,355
Why?

665
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,784
Do I look gloomy?

666
01:09:24,870 --> 01:09:27,573
Seeing you makes me want to go back to Japan

667
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:30,650
he gets honest when he gets drunk

668
01:09:32,267 --> 01:09:34,415
How about you?

669
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:38,361
i get merry when i get drunk

670
01:09:39,814 --> 01:09:41,228
You're not

671
01:09:42,814 --> 01:09:44,048
You can't get drunk too

672
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:47,025
It's his wake today, so it can't be helped.

673
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:51,353
I know you can stay here tonight

674
01:09:51,744 --> 01:09:53,908
Let's have drink together

675
01:09:54,869 --> 01:09:59,626
You don't miss Japan?

676
01:10:02,344 --> 01:10:03,789
I don’t

677
01:10:07,258 --> 01:10:10,367
You're lair

678
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:15,610
Your true heart says you want to go back to Japan

679
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:20,446
I know all people here miss Japan

680
01:10:22,337 --> 01:10:24,485
No one wanna be here

681
01:10:24,587 --> 01:10:26,501
There is no place where I go back

682
01:10:26,743 --> 01:10:31,594
you have a hometown

683
01:10:32,739 --> 01:10:34,888
Till childhood

684
01:10:35,411 --> 01:10:39,434
Did you have a bobbed hair when you were a child?

685
01:10:40,544 --> 01:10:41,380
Yes

686
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:43,083
You looked cute, didn't you?

687
01:10:45,255 --> 01:10:48,653
You guys were cute with shaved heads too.

688
01:10:49,116 --> 01:10:51,248
I'm still cute

689
01:10:53,655 --> 01:10:56,694
Do you see anyone here?

690
01:10:57,756 --> 01:10:59,303
Why you ask me?

691
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:01,676
You get drunk?

692
01:11:02,794 --> 01:11:08,544
If so, I would like to let you get married and return to Japan.

693
01:11:09,372 --> 01:11:14,340
I only love you guys

694
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:17,442
You are nice

695
01:11:21,656 --> 01:11:23,578
which do you like him or me?

696
01:11:25,836 --> 01:11:26,640
both

697
01:11:28,984 --> 01:11:31,804
You are cheeky

698
01:11:34,624 --> 01:11:37,937
But I don't wanna go to Japan

699
01:11:41,522 --> 01:11:45,920
Sasaki leader told me he wanted to go back with you

700
01:11:47,428 --> 01:11:48,616
No way

701
01:11:51,085 --> 01:11:51,842
damn it

702
01:11:55,022 --> 01:11:57,217
Sawamuwa wanted to go to Japan

703
01:11:59,981 --> 01:12:01,637
So he collected Jade

704
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:03,356
jade?

705
01:12:05,012 --> 01:12:06,043
You know?

706
01:12:06,184 --> 01:12:11,316
Sasaki leader told me There is a soldier who collects jade.

707
01:12:12,152 --> 01:12:13,550
He's Sawamura?

708
01:12:17,777 --> 01:12:21,566
Sasaki leader knew about that

709
01:12:29,164 --> 01:12:30,382
Hey

710
01:12:32,094 --> 01:12:32,867
hey!

711
01:12:37,398 --> 01:12:39,226
He's in the toilet

712
01:12:40,297 --> 01:12:41,289
You help me

713
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,603
How's it?

714
01:12:52,782 --> 01:12:53,446
keep going

715
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,446
I see

716
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:02,970
I'll massage you

717
01:13:05,153 --> 01:13:08,153
I used to be a masseuse

718
01:13:10,208 --> 01:13:10,942
Do it

719
01:13:27,134 --> 01:13:33,181
I found a store where you can buy alcohol cheaply.

720
01:13:34,126 --> 01:13:37,056
If you let me go out, I will buy it

721
01:13:38,134 --> 01:13:39,071
I don't drink

722
01:13:39,353 --> 01:13:40,509
Really?

723
01:13:41,368 --> 01:13:42,704
You only like women

724
01:13:47,338 --> 01:13:49,862
You are so play boy

725
01:13:52,878 --> 01:13:54,401
I know

726
01:13:57,237 --> 01:13:57,940
What's this?

727
01:13:58,151 --> 01:13:59,440
this is a talisman

728
01:13:59,925 --> 01:14:00,800
What for?

729
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:04,550
it's for the military.
Go back!

730
01:14:13,968 --> 01:14:14,898
Mr.private first class solider

731
01:14:16,218 --> 01:14:16,929
Good

732
01:14:31,424 --> 01:14:34,276
He has the jade

733
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:35,885
I see

734
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:38,479
he has it hanging around his neck

735
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:39,932
You sure?

736
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:43,112
I'll get it tonight

737
01:14:43,659 --> 01:14:44,292
tonight?

738
01:14:46,867 --> 01:14:48,164
at bed time

739
01:14:49,102 --> 01:14:50,078
You'll go alone?

740
01:14:51,547 --> 01:14:54,055
Earlier is better.
let's take it while he sleeps

741
01:14:55,328 --> 01:14:56,641
Ok Let's do it

742
01:14:57,678 --> 01:15:00,365
wake you up at 3am

743
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:24,924
Let's take a turn

744
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:26,728
Thanks

745
01:15:27,166 --> 01:15:27,830
Have you heard anything from me?

746
01:15:28,596 --> 01:15:29,244
Nothing

747
01:15:30,557 --> 01:15:32,041
Soviet soldiers are also sleeping

748
01:15:33,078 --> 01:15:34,375
It's 3 am now

749
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,238
The enemy has attacked!

750
01:16:19,793 --> 01:16:24,051
August 9, 1945 3:00 am

751
01:16:25,043 --> 01:16:27,590
The Soviet Union suddenly launched an attack on Japan.

752
01:16:28,559 --> 01:16:31,332
Leader has escaped!

753
01:16:37,410 --> 01:16:40,019
Let's catch him

754
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:41,597
Omiya

755
01:16:55,054 --> 01:16:56,390
Where he's gone?

756
01:16:57,499 --> 01:16:59,296
I think he's gone for Tamako

757
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:19,704
Wake up,Tamako

758
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:22,134
I'm off today

759
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:23,909
What the hell?

760
01:17:24,049 --> 01:17:26,768
The Soviet Union suddenly launched an attack

761
01:17:26,793 --> 01:17:27,799
Run away!

762
01:17:28,189 --> 01:17:30,650
You'll be killed

763
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,166
Where are we going?

764
01:17:34,447 --> 01:17:35,908
Let me go

765
01:17:39,559 --> 01:17:40,621
You stupid!

766
01:17:56,386 --> 01:17:57,011
I beat you

767
01:17:57,113 --> 01:17:58,793
Don't hit him yet

768
01:17:59,589 --> 01:18:02,191
you will go to jail again

769
01:18:02,652 --> 01:18:04,863
what are you saying?

770
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:08,267
I don't afraid anything

771
01:18:37,465 --> 01:18:38,903
You has them as I thought

772
01:18:39,512 --> 01:18:41,965
He killed Sawamura for this jade

773
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:46,715
He killed a solider?

774
01:18:48,153 --> 01:18:51,473
Why he killed?

775
01:18:55,646 --> 01:18:56,825
Mr.private first class solider

776
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:09,110
Even if he survived, he would end up being killed by the Soviet army.

777
01:19:21,071 --> 01:19:23,641
Please calm down

778
01:19:25,711 --> 01:19:29,149
The train is not coming because the tracks are destroyed

779
01:19:30,829 --> 01:19:33,188
Restoration is undecided

780
01:19:34,761 --> 01:19:37,831
the truck is about to leave

781
01:19:44,390 --> 01:19:45,476
I'm tired

782
01:19:46,718 --> 01:19:48,062
what are you saying?

783
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:50,280
i don't want to go back to japan

784
01:19:53,976 --> 01:19:57,523
he wants you to go back to japan

785
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:08,887
Please show me your boarding pass

786
01:20:09,317 --> 01:20:09,825
What's that?

787
01:20:10,059 --> 01:20:10,880
you can't ride without it

788
01:20:11,106 --> 01:20:11,723
Why?

789
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:12,989
the general public is the last

790
01:20:13,637 --> 01:20:15,645
Who they are?

791
01:20:15,817 --> 01:20:16,817
they are a military family

792
01:20:18,130 --> 01:20:19,567
she is also from a military family

793
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,278
Tell my boss about it

794
01:20:30,437 --> 01:20:31,562
Please let her get in the truck

795
01:20:32,804 --> 01:20:33,499
Your family?

796
01:20:33,687 --> 01:20:35,710
She's my wife

797
01:20:36,423 --> 01:20:37,767
Solider family is the last

798
01:20:38,376 --> 01:20:39,103
Why?

799
01:20:39,829 --> 01:20:41,055
The officer's family is ahead

800
01:20:41,126 --> 01:20:42,642
That's

801
01:20:45,681 --> 01:20:46,580
Give him that

802
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:53,994
This is jade

803
01:20:55,494 --> 01:20:55,986
Really?

804
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:57,611
I'll give you

805
01:21:04,286 --> 01:21:05,044
Thank you very much

806
01:21:06,013 --> 01:21:06,591
Let's go

807
01:21:20,615 --> 01:21:22,997
Thanks,Arita

808
01:21:23,497 --> 01:21:24,786
Thanks to the Jade

809
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:27,530
I still have 4

810
01:21:28,397 --> 01:21:29,498
use this in case of emergency

811
01:21:30,217 --> 01:21:31,577
Take this too

812
01:21:39,087 --> 01:21:39,946
What's wrong?

813
01:21:42,212 --> 01:21:44,180
You're so kind

814
01:21:46,884 --> 01:21:49,415
Don't cry.
Stay as you are

815
01:21:51,094 --> 01:21:53,329
We wanted to play with three people

816
01:21:54,016 --> 01:21:57,438
i will never forget you

817
01:21:58,805 --> 01:22:02,610
If you're alive, maybe we'll meet again

818
01:22:04,918 --> 01:22:07,129
please survive too

819
01:22:11,067 --> 01:22:12,051
Get out

820
01:22:21,548 --> 01:22:22,306
What the hell?

821
01:22:23,525 --> 01:22:25,650
We're officers

822
01:22:25,932 --> 01:22:29,408
It is cowardly for soldiers to flee before women and children.

823
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:31,236
this is for war

824
01:22:32,010 --> 01:22:32,955
Get off!

825
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:48,483
Get off!

826
01:22:52,756 --> 01:22:54,514
I will kill you if you don't get off

827
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:02,357
Line up

828
01:23:03,547 --> 01:23:07,023
take their armbands

829
01:23:14,913 --> 01:23:19,116
you guys don't pretend you're great

830
01:23:40,179 --> 01:23:42,937
Everyone! Get in the truck!

831
01:23:55,391 --> 01:23:56,305
driver

832
01:24:02,744 --> 01:24:04,017
Omiya

833
01:24:47,205 --> 01:24:48,588
Oh shit. I left him there

834
01:24:48,744 --> 01:24:50,229
It's too late

835
01:24:51,248 --> 01:24:53,459
Please go with me

836
01:24:54,029 --> 01:24:54,779
But..

837
01:24:54,943 --> 01:24:57,646
do you like him more than me?

838
01:25:01,735 --> 01:25:02,641
Omiya!

839
01:25:16,954 --> 01:25:18,407
Mr.private first class solider!

840
01:25:34,494 --> 01:25:41,540
THE END

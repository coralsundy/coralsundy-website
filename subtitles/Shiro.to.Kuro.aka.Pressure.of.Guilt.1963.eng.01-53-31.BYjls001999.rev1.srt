2
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,094
You will kill me?

3
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,735
You can't kill me.

4
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:51,023
You are my mistress.

5
00:01:39,173 --> 00:01:39,660
Ma'am.

6
00:02:27,588 --> 00:02:28,622
Good evening.

7
00:02:29,227 --> 00:02:30,267
It's awfully cold.

8
00:03:22,142 --> 00:03:25,288
Hamano?
Your wife in in trouble.

9
00:03:28,636 --> 00:03:31,329
Please come quickly.
Come quickly!

10
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:57,962
Where's he now?

11
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:00,476
He's on business trip to Kyushu.

12
00:04:00,646 --> 00:04:01,479
Did you tell him?

13
00:04:03,283 --> 00:04:04,097
I telegramed.

14
00:04:05,691 --> 00:04:09,104
Mr. Munekata, president of the Jonan Bar Association.

15
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,077
Right?

16
00:04:12,843 --> 00:04:14,616
Where were you?

17
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:19,630
I was at cooking school at 8:30.

18
00:04:21,665 --> 00:04:22,958
Cooking school.

19
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:27,780
I saw her dead body when I backed.

20
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,124
What time was it?

21
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:34,232
Just before 10pm.

22
00:04:36,135 --> 00:04:38,835
You were out 8:30-10:00.

23
00:04:43,753 --> 00:04:47,120
Before you left, did you notice anything unusual?

24
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:52,232
For example, a stranger visited her.
Or someone wandering around?

25
00:04:52,521 --> 00:04:58,628
I just saw Hamano before I left.

26
00:04:59,702 --> 00:05:00,215
Hamano?

27
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:01,775
Hey.

28
00:05:03,377 --> 00:05:08,243
Mr.Munekata took care of me.

29
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,473
I'm Lawyer Hamano who was working with him.

30
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:16,813
He's Munekata's co-worker.

31
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:21,050
Ok come in.

32
00:05:26,194 --> 00:05:30,174
So you lived with them for about three years before you left the office.

33
00:05:32,015 --> 00:05:33,535
Then you know a lot about the family situation, etc.

34
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,850
Did your wife have any enemies?

35
00:05:40,247 --> 00:05:41,720
As far as I know..

36
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:45,520
I understand you arrived here at about 8:20 this evening.

37
00:05:48,907 --> 00:05:49,294
Yes.

38
00:05:49,954 --> 00:05:52,127
What did she sound like then?

39
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:59,701
I heard she was absent because of a cold.
So I went to visit her.

40
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,908
What time did you get home?

41
00:06:09,576 --> 00:06:10,323
8...

42
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:14,843
I'd be very grateful if you could tell me the exact time.

43
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,793
I can't tell you every minute.
That's about right.

44
00:06:31,547 --> 00:06:32,194
Manager!

45
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,064
We arrested!

46
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:34,784
What?

47
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:35,964
We arrested the criminal!

48
00:06:53,329 --> 00:07:03,631
<i>Shiro to Kuro / Pressure of Guilt (1963)</i>

49
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:39,788
Oh Munekata's wife was killed..

50
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,796
Come on,Dad.

51
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,829
Can't you get up 10 or 20 minutes earlier?
Can't you at least read the paper?

52
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,880
Here's your meal.

53
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,990
The wife I know was murdered.

54
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,550
Who?

55
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,634
MUNEKATA, abolitionist of the death penalty

56
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,300
He's the president of the Jonan Bar Association.

57
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:15,891
I saw the news on TV.

58
00:09:17,285 --> 00:09:19,765
When are you going to have your surgery?

59
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,584
Hemorrhoid surgery.

60
00:09:24,321 --> 00:09:25,801
I'm too busy.

61
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,747
That's what you're afraid of.

62
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:32,789
You are big guy but You are coward.

63
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:34,302
I'm going.

64
00:09:34,508 --> 00:09:36,908
Watch out the traffic.

65
00:09:42,844 --> 00:09:44,317
Are you going to the office?

66
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:56,085
Good morning.

67
00:09:57,968 --> 00:10:00,508
Mr. Terauchi from MITI called me last night.

68
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:01,235
You decided?

69
00:10:01,412 --> 00:10:04,579
March 3rd, 6:00 p.m. at the Hotel Tokyo.
Fee is 1000yen.

70
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:09,679
You are stingy.
We can go to Atami and Hakone for our Alumni Association.

71
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:11,743
Atami and Hakone are boring.

72
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:15,320
It's Saturday, and I'm going out with the director.

73
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:25,913
What's the hell about the director.
You'll just have a business meeting.

74
00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:28,969
Well, he's the Construction Chief.
That's good.

75
00:10:32,876 --> 00:10:34,876
Stay inside.

76
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:37,136
Move inside.

77
00:10:39,226 --> 00:10:40,719
Move inside.

78
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:41,786
I'm getting off next.

79
00:10:43,307 --> 00:10:45,207
Next stop,Kasumigaseki.

80
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:04,554
Good morning.

81
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:09,720
Good morning.

82
00:11:18,904 --> 00:11:20,144
Good morning.

83
00:11:29,318 --> 00:11:30,245
Good morning.

84
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:33,458
Good morning.

85
00:11:34,464 --> 00:11:37,138
This is beautiful like you.

86
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:38,304
Thank you very much.

87
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,819
Let's go to a movie together sometime.

88
00:11:44,518 --> 00:11:48,331
Movie?
Skating is cool these days.

89
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:50,325
I can't do skating.

90
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:01,435
Well..

91
00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:08,836
The witnesses are Yoshida and Kubota.

92
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,215
Shall we invite them?

93
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,565
Room 313.

94
00:12:16,413 --> 00:12:18,333
He's here.

95
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,895
Managing director is calling you.

96
00:12:26,377 --> 00:12:28,097
How's it going? Have you made up your mind?

97
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:29,015
What?

98
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:31,114
Hemorrhoid surgery.

99
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:34,515
I drink too much.

100
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,482
Don't worry too much about your wife.

101
00:12:37,309 --> 00:12:40,689
I'm a matchmaker myself, so I have a bit of responsibility.

102
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:44,473
By the way, I have something for you.

103
00:12:57,702 --> 00:13:00,942
I heard that Munakata-san's wife was young and beautiful.

104
00:13:01,863 --> 00:13:02,790
That's what the papers said.

105
00:13:13,707 --> 00:13:15,373
It's a very flashy case.

106
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:20,437
But the Metropolitan Police Department did a good job with the speedy arrest.

107
00:13:22,216 --> 00:13:24,763
Is HIRAO in charge of group 6?

108
00:13:25,776 --> 00:13:27,323
Oh you know him.

109
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,387
We are old friends.

110
00:13:31,373 --> 00:13:37,966
He's a little stubborn and hard-headed.
But he's a hard worker.

111
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:05,496
The incident occurred at approximately 9:40 p.m. on January 17, 1963

112
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:09,905
Mrs. YASUE, 37 years old, was strangled to death and robbed of money and goods at the residence of Harumasa MUNAKATA,

113
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:18,871
a lawyer at 2-13, Government 2-chome, Nakameguro, Meguro-ku, Tokyo.

114
00:14:22,471 --> 00:14:24,464
You had no idea how much cash she had?

115
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:27,882
She always carries a handbag...

116
00:14:28,503 --> 00:14:30,376
And the necklace, was it pearl?

117
00:14:30,831 --> 00:14:31,291
Yes.

118
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,563
You remember the color and shape" of the ring and watch, don't you?

119
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:44,648
Numerous fingerprints were collected from the jewelry box and other items.

120
00:14:45,755 --> 00:14:52,028
However, no fingerprints were found on the red waistband used in the murder.

121
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:59,841
The murderer's route of entry and escape was through the front door of the house, which was left unlocked.

122
00:15:13,127 --> 00:15:21,575
The situation at the time of the arrest of the murderer, Detective 43 found a man who was acting suspiciously.

123
00:16:11,542 --> 00:16:12,276
Don't move.

124
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:16,077
Earrings and Rings

125
00:16:18,132 --> 00:16:18,938
Ring.

126
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,023
Necklaces

127
00:16:34,218 --> 00:16:35,825
That's a fancy case.

128
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,048
It's rather easy to deduce.

129
00:16:40,575 --> 00:16:41,102
Okay.

130
00:16:43,438 --> 00:16:46,298
Okay. Let's do it.
Bring Wakita.

131
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,419
You must be Shokichi Wakita.

132
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,386
What's your date of birth?

133
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,336
November 22nd, 1931.

134
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,212
Where is your legal domicile?

135
00:17:13,156 --> 00:17:16,563
Azatomitsu, Koko no Mura, Shimohira-gun, Iwate Prefecture, Japan

136
00:17:17,972 --> 00:17:18,532
Address?

137
00:17:25,872 --> 00:17:26,665
No fixed address.

138
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,365
You have a criminal record.

139
00:17:30,192 --> 00:17:36,066
Six years and nine months in prison, along with one count of theft and robbery.

140
00:17:37,196 --> 00:17:39,943
I guess you could say I've been living in prison since I was 20.

141
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:43,397
By the way.

142
00:17:45,124 --> 00:17:45,777
Mr. Prosecutor.

143
00:17:48,387 --> 00:17:53,520
I've told the police everything I know.
I may have robbed, but I didn't kill her.

144
00:17:54,162 --> 00:17:55,395
That ain't what I did.

145
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:11,886
Thank you very much.

146
00:18:12,726 --> 00:18:13,386
Here you go.

147
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,188
Thank you very much.

148
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,928
When did you come from Kyushu?

149
00:19:03,495 --> 00:19:04,782
First JAL flight this morning.

150
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,806
I never thought I'd leave my wife's funeral twice in my life.

151
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,323
There's a lawlessness in this world.

152
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:20,202
I'd kill him if I saw him in front of me.

153
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:38,623
Then it was 8:30 when you left Asahimachi Daikokuya House, right?

154
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:42,513
I don't have a watch, but that's about right.

155
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,046
How much money did you have then?

156
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:47,343
About 200 yen.

157
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:54,177
You took the Yamanote line from the south exit and arrived at Meguro station around 9:00, right?

158
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,067
That's about right.

159
00:20:19,427 --> 00:20:22,160
I walked around for about half an hour.

160
00:20:40,368 --> 00:20:43,681
Apparently, there was something oddly unpopular about the place.

161
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,982
The door was not locked?

162
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:40,947
She was dead?

163
00:22:41,432 --> 00:22:44,198
Yeah, with a red waistband around her neck.

164
00:22:48,999 --> 00:22:50,826
That's a bit of a surprise.

165
00:22:52,629 --> 00:22:57,669
But I couldn't call 110, so...
So I got to work.

166
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:01,312
She was already dead when you walked in, right?

167
00:23:01,605 --> 00:23:02,292
Oh, yeah.

168
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,279
Bullshit.

169
00:23:09,523 --> 00:23:13,170
A little too childish for the work of a four-time felon, don't you think?

170
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:17,725
That might work in the real world, but it won't work here.

171
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,067
Mr. Hamano.

172
00:24:27,574 --> 00:24:28,287
Mr. Hamano.

173
00:24:38,471 --> 00:24:44,237
So the woman was dead.
With a red waistband around her neck.

174
00:24:45,673 --> 00:24:46,653
She was alive.

175
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:53,609
She was alive?

176
00:24:54,999 --> 00:24:58,412
The woman was sleeping soundly on bed.

177
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,104
Yesterday and the day before, she was dead.

178
00:25:07,183 --> 00:25:08,543
You told me She was alive today.

179
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:13,785
The D.A. won't believe me if she's dead.
I don't blame him.

180
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:26,202
What do you want?

181
00:25:27,972 --> 00:25:29,358
I wanna know what you did.

182
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:32,965
I told you that.

183
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,823
Well, if it's exactly what you did, you're a little naive, aren't you?

184
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,217
Why?

185
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:54,828
How many days has it been since you sat in that chair?

186
00:25:57,221 --> 00:25:58,068
Five days.

187
00:25:58,985 --> 00:26:05,425
You told me The first day and the next, the woman was dead.
But since yesterday, she's been lying alive on the bed.

188
00:26:06,556 --> 00:26:09,669
Who can trust you?

189
00:26:12,344 --> 00:26:16,330
Wakita..if she was died..

190
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,056
Why did you steal there?

191
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:22,604
I told you she was alive.

192
00:26:22,752 --> 00:26:26,172
Why she didn't wake up?

193
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:29,100
She was completely sleeping?

194
00:26:31,344 --> 00:26:36,398


195
00:26:37,237 --> 00:26:40,644
She was dead from the moment you walked in the room.
Or she was sleeping peacefully while you were working, either way, it doesn't make sense.

196
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,300
Then what the hell was going on with the woman when you walked in?

197
00:27:04,097 --> 00:27:04,537
Wakita.

198
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,481
I heard you didn't sleep well.

199
00:27:18,213 --> 00:27:22,720
The D.A. is going to be on me every single day.

200
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:35,309
By the way, you got a new defense attorney.

201
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:37,742
Court-appointed, right?

202
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,912
No.
He's the husband of the wife you killed.

203
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,520
He's a famous abolitionist lawyer in Japan.

204
00:27:55,213 --> 00:27:57,393
There are some strange people in this world.

205
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,147
You arrived at Meguro station at about 9 PM?

206
00:28:08,557 --> 00:28:11,710
You bought cigarettes from a tobacconist, walked out of the shopping district to a residential area.

207
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:16,482
You spent a half an hour going around the residential area looking for a place to break into.

208
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:19,361
You arrived at the Munekatas' house at about 9:30 or 9:40.

209
00:28:21,227 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm gonna need you to be more specific from now on.

210
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:26,210
So the front door was unlocked?

211
00:28:26,343 --> 00:28:29,869
Mr. D.A., how many times do you have to ask me the same thing?

212
00:28:30,113 --> 00:28:31,853
Well, I guess that's as far as anyone's going to go with that.

213
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,205
I'm in bad mood today.

214
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:40,658
I got a letter from my mom in the country yesterday.

215
00:28:42,709 --> 00:28:43,716
She wrote some strange things.

216
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:49,467
She said I should tell the truth and serve my sins gracefully.

217
00:28:51,411 --> 00:28:53,544
She thought I killed her.

218
00:29:16,569 --> 00:29:17,163
D.A.

219
00:29:19,521 --> 00:29:27,200
I don't care if I get the death penalty for a robbery followed by a murder.
I'd be in prison for 10 years for robbery alone.

220
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:38,406
I'm not gonna do ten years in this body, or even five more in prison.

221
00:29:41,707 --> 00:29:46,874
I was thinking about that when I got Mom's letter.
I couldn't sleep last night.

222
00:29:50,467 --> 00:29:51,053
D.A.

223
00:29:53,513 --> 00:29:55,673
I know you don't trust me.

224
00:29:57,863 --> 00:30:04,449
I was born in the middle of nowhere.
There are only three houses among the mountains and fields

225
00:30:06,259 --> 00:30:08,739
It's like a cattle pen, but it's all there.

226
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:24,307
Behind our house is a wood.
That's where my dead dad and brother are buried.

227
00:30:26,413 --> 00:30:27,726
It's very quiet.

228
00:30:29,556 --> 00:30:30,856
It's so peaceful.

229
00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:39,365
Birds come here all the time.
I used to catch them with a net when I was a kid.

230
00:30:44,792 --> 00:30:48,198
I can't wait to get in there and stretch my legs.

231
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:55,752
I don't like being in jail, but it's hard enough having the D.A. chastise me every day.

232
00:30:57,623 --> 00:30:58,777
I don't know what else to do.

233
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:05,926
D.A.

234
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,033
I'm gonna tell you the truth right now.

235
00:31:13,683 --> 00:31:21,163
I'm the one who killed your wife.

236
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:38,989
As I told you above... Masayoshi Wakita, 28, was questioned. He confessed this afternoon that he was responsible for the murder.

237
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:43,017
Next, at the JMA...

238
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,007
I'm so relieved.

239
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:49,813
Because I don't like the idea that we'll never figure out who did it.

240
00:31:50,714 --> 00:31:51,588
Right?

241
00:31:55,132 --> 00:31:55,659
What's wrong?

242
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:20,392
I know exactly how you feel.

243
00:32:21,417 --> 00:32:25,724
She was like family to you... a little too young, a little too beautiful.

244
00:32:26,729 --> 00:32:29,189
She was like a mother to you.

245
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,970
She was killed..

246
00:32:34,229 --> 00:32:36,255
Cheer up.

247
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,019
And the culprit clearly confessed, so it's settled.
The case is now closed.

248
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,684
Thank you very much.

249
00:33:04,917 --> 00:33:06,577
One more sake.

250
00:33:08,202 --> 00:33:08,975
Long time no see.

251
00:33:12,172 --> 00:33:14,432
I've been busy at work.

252
00:33:14,545 --> 00:33:15,865
You are great.

253
00:33:18,739 --> 00:33:20,646
Don't be bossy.

254
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:25,572
Hey, treat me nice.

255
00:33:29,427 --> 00:33:31,007
You know?

256
00:33:34,308 --> 00:33:37,014
Mr. Wakita.
The case was closed easily.

257
00:33:38,301 --> 00:33:39,894
Not so easily.

258
00:33:40,928 --> 00:33:46,221
Everything is dead.
That's what it feels like when a weight is lifted off my shoulders.

259
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,854
hey, what are you doing?

260
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,096
Long time no see.

261
00:35:12,028 --> 00:35:13,008
Hi. Hi.

262
00:35:14,885 --> 00:35:16,351
Hi, I'm sorry it took me so long to get here last night.

263
00:35:16,673 --> 00:35:19,466
I'm sorry to ask so late at night.

264
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:21,559
Have a seat.

265
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:37,490
I heard Wakita confessed.

266
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,231
So you are here.

267
00:35:45,206 --> 00:35:48,252
If that's the case, we'll We're formally charging him with robbery-homicide.

268
00:35:48,707 --> 00:35:50,467
We'll have him formally charged with robbery-homicide in a couple of days.

269
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:55,448
Wakita's confession... is it credible?

270
00:35:56,161 --> 00:35:56,795
credible?

271
00:35:59,301 --> 00:36:02,408
This case will never move.

272
00:36:04,105 --> 00:36:07,745
I'm the one who wants to know.

273
00:36:08,503 --> 00:36:12,097
What kind of expert testimony and evidence will you use in your defense?

274
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,562
No matter what happens, he'll get the death penalty.

275
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,497
I'm Munakata, and I've been retained to represent you.

276
00:36:51,907 --> 00:36:54,320
This is Hamano, who is helping me with your case.

277
00:37:00,557 --> 00:37:05,910
I'm going to go ahead and decline, but I'm not aware that I've been asked to represent you yet.

278
00:37:07,093 --> 00:37:13,593
I've been calling for the abolition of the death penalty for 40 years.

279
00:37:14,113 --> 00:37:20,313
I have my reasons.
First, killing is unacceptable from a humanitarian point of view.

280
00:37:21,894 --> 00:37:28,401
Second, trials are often wrong.
It's a human thing to do.

281
00:37:29,795 --> 00:37:35,595
There are cases in which a wrong trial takes place, and it is only after the execution that we find out about it.

282
00:37:36,433 --> 00:37:41,600
Therefore, the state sometimes commits murder by mistake.

283
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,270
I see.

284
00:37:48,522 --> 00:37:52,428
You say you're willing to cleanly forgive me for killing your wife.

285
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:58,009
Isn't that what you're saying?

286
00:38:00,155 --> 00:38:07,918
To be honest with you, I hate you.
I hate you.

287
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:16,020
But I need to be able to truly forgive you.

288
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:21,089
Because  if not, I've been lying to all kinds of people for 40 years.

289
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:29,926
I get it.
You want to work for yourself.

290
00:38:30,323 --> 00:38:32,750
Ok go ahead.

291
00:38:41,477 --> 00:38:48,624
As for the upcoming case, the fact that you got in one day of someone else's life and stole their stuff can't be moved.

292
00:38:49,987 --> 00:38:53,160
They have all the physical evidence they need.

293
00:38:53,686 --> 00:38:59,719
But for the murder, there's no physical evidence.

294
00:39:01,513 --> 00:39:04,253
It's kind of circumstantial.

295
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:09,399
They have your own confession that you killed her.

296
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:18,306
We will do our very best to make your guilt as light as possible.

297
00:39:19,288 --> 00:39:27,636
So don't hide anything from us, just be honest and tell us the truth.

298
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,574
Did you in fact kill someone?

299
00:39:33,604 --> 00:39:45,915
Or did you confess to such a fact, but only under the guiding or intimidating interrogation of a police officer or prosecutor?

300
00:39:48,147 --> 00:39:53,507
Or was there something else going on that you had to tell me?

301
00:39:55,186 --> 00:39:57,420
There's nothing going on.

302
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:00,843
You killed her?

303
00:40:02,095 --> 00:40:02,775
Yes.

304
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:04,549
Are you sure?

305
00:40:06,797 --> 00:40:07,970
Cut it out.

306
00:40:08,767 --> 00:40:10,187
You're just like the prosecutor.

307
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:14,686
He's like you killed!

308
00:40:16,087 --> 00:40:20,413
When you're interrogated so persistently, even if I didn't do it.
I can't help it.

309
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:22,402
You know?

310
00:40:22,949 --> 00:40:23,803
So.

311
00:40:24,991 --> 00:40:26,124
The D.A..

312
00:40:26,317 --> 00:40:28,371
I did it.

313
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,390
I told you.

314
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,164
It doesn't matter.

315
00:40:37,404 --> 00:40:38,224
I did it.

316
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,777
I did it.

317
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:44,483
I did it.

318
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,430
I did it.

319
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:04,723
I read it.

320
00:41:05,197 --> 00:41:06,410
Thanks.

321
00:41:07,424 --> 00:41:10,124
It's a lot easier for a trial prosecutor when the investigating prosecutor does all this.

322
00:41:11,172 --> 00:41:14,018
In this case, the case itself is clear.

323
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:19,826
It's a skill to express it in the right sentences.

324
00:41:21,174 --> 00:41:23,508
You messed up a lot at first.

325
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,692
It's better to get used to it than to learn it.
It's been 10 years since I work here.

326
00:41:28,231 --> 00:41:29,431
Bonus please!

327
00:41:29,744 --> 00:41:31,138
The 10-year player's?

328
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:51,735
The case of the defendant, Wakita, for robbery and murder is now before the court.

329
00:41:53,618 --> 00:42:00,371
Defendant Wakita, please stand.

330
00:42:05,196 --> 00:42:23,618
At approximately 9:30 or 9:40 p.m. on the same day, you broke into the Munekata residence at 1213, 2-chome, Nakameguro, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, with the intent to commit a burglary, and ransacked the house for money and entered Mrs. Munekata's bedroom.

331
00:42:24,183 --> 00:42:29,017
When Mrs. Yasue 37 years old blamed you for the murder,you immediately had the urge to kill her.

332
00:42:29,482 --> 00:42:32,729
You tied her up with a red waistband her found on the spot.

333
00:42:33,063 --> 00:42:36,423
You killed by asphyxiation to death.

334
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,800
You stole the omega watch, market value 60,000 yen

335
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,305
Pearl necklace with sapphire ring with a market value of 150,000 yen

336
00:42:46,806 --> 00:42:51,972
Pearl ring with diamonds, market value ¥20,000, earrings with diamonds, market value ¥70,000

337
00:42:52,664 --> 00:42:57,064
and 48,000 yen in cash in a handbag.

338
00:42:58,266 --> 00:43:00,926
Penalty: Article 240 of the Penal Code

339
00:43:05,326 --> 00:43:08,026
First of all, this case is a kind of indiscriminate murder.

340
00:43:08,988 --> 00:43:11,641
This is a senseless murder.

341
00:43:13,027 --> 00:43:15,574
Killing a person simply because she was seen.

342
00:43:16,888 --> 00:43:21,974
It is as easy to take a precious human life as if you were twisting it out of an insect.

343
00:43:22,784 --> 00:43:28,710
And while committing the crime, the defendant shows no remorse.

344
00:43:32,507 --> 00:43:37,540
I see.
Defendant Wakita has four prior convictions.

345
00:43:39,168 --> 00:43:46,041
Prosecutors say that a person with a criminal record like this would commit a crime like this with impunity.

346
00:43:46,470 --> 00:43:55,475
However, if the maximum sentence is imposed simply because a person has a criminal record,

347
00:43:56,583 --> 00:44:00,450
there will remain a major humanitarian problem.

348
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:04,025
Even ex-convicts have human rights.

349
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:46,327
That's enough.

350
00:44:48,747 --> 00:44:49,893
You're so horny.

351
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,243
You're out of your mind.
It's like you've changed.

352
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:13,621
Ever since that incident... and not just you.
Munakata-san is too.

353
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:20,981
Munakata-san is the worst.

354
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:29,048
He's defending a trial like that, and the people involved will always remember the bad things.

355
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:35,351
Unless there's another culprit.

356
00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:41,803
No matter how much effort you and Munakata-san put in, Wakita won't be saved.

357
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:52,329
Or maybe you can help Wakita with your defense skills.

358
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,987
You have the confidence to lighten his sentence?

359
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:59,386
I don't need you telling me how to do my job.

360
00:46:05,606 --> 00:46:07,726
It's time for you to get ready.

361
00:46:17,631 --> 00:46:21,131
Are you going home?

362
00:46:23,262 --> 00:46:25,049
One more bar!

363
00:46:29,193 --> 00:46:31,159
Get out of my way!

364
00:46:33,555 --> 00:46:34,895
Hamano.

365
00:46:40,094 --> 00:46:45,674
Do You Know the Minister of Construction?

366
00:46:47,353 --> 00:46:48,046
Let's go.

367
00:46:48,446 --> 00:46:49,392
I'm off to home.

368
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:50,406
I'm off to home.

369
00:46:50,919 --> 00:46:53,673
You are bad.

370
00:47:06,528 --> 00:47:07,508
Welcome.

371
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,382
Welcome.

372
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:21,698
Please sit Minister of Construction.

373
00:47:22,678 --> 00:47:23,991
What's the hell?

374
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,081
What do you drink?

375
00:47:28,735 --> 00:47:31,195
Let's save money

376
00:47:31,799 --> 00:47:33,225
Suntory Old.

377
00:47:33,598 --> 00:47:34,125
And you?

378
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,538
Water with whiskey.

379
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:38,518
Brandy fro Miyamoto.

380
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:42,746
It's unusual you came here.

381
00:47:42,988 --> 00:47:44,988
He's minister.
He's just constructor.

382
00:47:45,925 --> 00:47:46,698
And you?

383
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:48,512
I won't tell about my job.

384
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:52,485
He's scary.

385
00:47:53,323 --> 00:47:59,243
He would change his mind for money.

386
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:00,840
He's nasty.

387
00:48:00,865 --> 00:48:02,571
Are you police or something?

388
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:07,724
No no.
Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office

389
00:48:10,413 --> 00:48:14,433
I'm Miyamoto of the Miyamoto Gumi

390
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:25,277
President.
The world today is afraid of ordinary people.

391
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:32,808
Just the other day... you saw it in the newspaper, didn't you?
The murder of a beautiful lawyer's wife.

392
00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:37,263
He worked on that case and put one of his own on death row.

393
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:42,058
What's wrong?

394
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:47,275
You work on that case with Mr. Munakata, don't you?

395
00:48:51,044 --> 00:48:54,690
This is Hamano, the lawyer.
From the Jonan Bar Association.

396
00:48:58,891 --> 00:49:00,238
I see.

397
00:49:01,058 --> 00:49:02,704
So that case..

398
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:08,933
Excuse me, are you single, Mr. Hamano?

399
00:49:09,779 --> 00:49:14,632
If so, you'd better watch out for this guy.
He's even playing matchmaker.

400
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:24,348
Hamano's our general counsel, and I invited him to a party today.

401
00:49:25,577 --> 00:49:31,530
He is very supportive of our company.
I introduced him a woman.

402
00:49:32,117 --> 00:49:34,524
First of all, congratulations.

403
00:49:35,201 --> 00:49:41,708
No, no, unfortunately.
Just at the last minute, the other party suddenly starts acting strangely.

404
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:44,755
So he's still single.

405
00:49:45,452 --> 00:49:48,126
Are you into him?

406
00:49:48,452 --> 00:49:49,559
Really?

407
00:49:51,638 --> 00:49:56,204
I heard this time the murderer didn't want to confess.

408
00:49:56,941 --> 00:50:01,888
I'm sorry to hear that.

409
00:50:02,076 --> 00:50:03,436
It could be.

410
00:50:07,086 --> 00:50:11,406
The details of this case are clear.

411
00:50:11,713 --> 00:50:14,180
The only question is whether or not he'll confess.

412
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,014
I guess that's the way it is.

413
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:27,270
Mr. Munakata and you are worse off this time.

414
00:50:27,888 --> 00:50:32,202
It's hard to defend even in layman's terms.

415
00:50:35,051 --> 00:50:37,645
No, no, not really.

416
00:50:38,565 --> 00:50:41,545
Lawyers have ideas.

417
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:52,378
for example... If you can't move the crime, there's a lot you can do.

418
00:50:54,078 --> 00:50:55,198
I see.

419
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:06,079
Do you have physical evidence that he killed his wife?

420
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:14,735
I was told the only question is whether he confessed or not.

421
00:51:17,163 --> 00:51:21,137
Physical evidence is more important than confession, first and foremost.

422
00:51:25,238 --> 00:51:25,938
Hamano.

423
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:34,326
As for Mr. Takahara and I,

424
00:51:36,102 --> 00:51:41,129
we've done all the work we can do at the trial.

425
00:51:43,949 --> 00:51:45,809
You know that?

426
00:51:51,203 --> 00:51:52,143
You think so?

427
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:59,742
As an investigative prosecutor, you did all you could.

428
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,959
Stop talking it.

429
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:08,286
You've believed from the start that Wakita was the real culprit?

430
00:52:11,874 --> 00:52:16,940
There's plenty of physical evidence against Wakita as a robber.

431
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,226
But there is no evidence as a murder.

432
00:52:23,116 --> 00:52:31,726
You decided from the beginning that he was a murderer.

433
00:52:32,992 --> 00:52:35,159
You forced him to confess.

434
00:52:35,752 --> 00:52:38,819
Is that the attitude of a prosecutor in pursuit of the truth?

435
00:52:38,893 --> 00:52:43,893
Do you think there's real murder?

436
00:52:48,617 --> 00:52:53,103
You think you know that?

437
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:02,171
Stop talking it.

438
00:53:03,176 --> 00:53:06,243
Let's have fun.

439
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:08,802
Bring alcohols.

440
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:16,619
Why don't you think about your body a little bit?

441
00:53:18,122 --> 00:53:20,322
I don't care if it hurts or bleeds.

442
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:24,147
Who you were  with?

443
00:53:24,314 --> 00:53:25,634
It's none of your business.

444
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:35,753
He's really cheeky.

445
00:53:36,851 --> 00:53:37,958
What's wrong?

446
00:53:38,238 --> 00:53:39,211
It's none of your business.

447
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:45,187
Water.

448
00:53:56,849 --> 00:54:00,662
We don't see any questions, and of course we wouldn't ask for a supplemental investigation.

449
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,177
The case is clear.

450
00:54:02,503 --> 00:54:07,176
Could you be a little more objective?

451
00:54:07,501 --> 00:54:08,388
What?

452
00:54:09,034 --> 00:54:10,247
The robbery is fine.

453
00:54:11,436 --> 00:54:16,522
But for the murder, there are too many preconceived notions that Wakita is the murderer.

454
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:19,489
I don't think everything is fine.

455
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:26,490
What's the matter, Ochiai?
Are you saying then that there is someone else besides Wakita who is the real culprit?

456
00:54:29,107 --> 00:54:30,573
I don't mean that.

457
00:54:35,661 --> 00:54:37,287
Why are you coming back to this now?

458
00:54:37,982 --> 00:54:39,642
The first investigation was the matter.

459
00:54:40,252 --> 00:54:44,279
The problem is that we've been investigating everything on the assumption that Wakita committed the murder.

460
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:49,927
Yano!
I'd like you to stop making a mess of things now.

461
00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:52,641
There's no end to the questions we can ask.

462
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:54,410
I know how you feel.

463
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:57,284
There's something that's been bothering me.

464
00:54:58,216 --> 00:54:59,563
Why are you coming back to this now?

465
00:55:01,393 --> 00:55:07,640
Speaking of trendy mystery novels, there are other culprits.

466
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:11,772
There are two.
Hamano and his mistress.

467
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:20,884
This mystery novel would be if this Wakita guy didn't appear at all from the beginning, though.

468
00:55:30,856 --> 00:55:32,623
Hamano and his mistress.

469
00:55:38,364 --> 00:55:44,451
Come to think of it, why did Hamano go out of his way to visit people's homes?

470
00:55:45,526 --> 00:55:46,219
In the middle of the night.

471
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:52,419
He kept saying there was no physical evidence of the murder.

472
00:55:53,292 --> 00:55:56,785
Maybe he knows something special that no one else knows.

473
00:55:58,752 --> 00:55:59,332
Ochiai.

474
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:17,864
He might say something about that special circumstance at trial.

475
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:24,272
If that happens, we're in big trouble.

476
00:56:27,066 --> 00:56:34,053
Let's start all over again with a clean slate.
But it's too late now to do that.

477
00:56:36,088 --> 00:56:37,041
But...

478
00:56:40,676 --> 00:56:42,396
You look serious.

479
00:56:43,261 --> 00:56:45,141
I've got some thinking to do.

480
00:56:45,966 --> 00:56:49,379
You can't just think about it.
You have to act.

481
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:54,200
You can't just think this way and that way.

482
00:56:56,471 --> 00:56:59,671
You got that sponsor, too.

483
00:57:06,251 --> 00:57:06,804
Who?

484
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:11,323
He's Akemi's husband.

485
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:12,372
He's Akemi's husband?

486
00:57:12,591 --> 00:57:16,458
Don't be disappointed.
How old do you think she is?

487
00:57:16,652 --> 00:57:18,239
She's 35.

488
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:19,883
Light.

489
00:57:21,966 --> 00:57:26,832
he can't survive on her own.
That's why she have to cheat on him.

490
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:28,900
You know?

491
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:30,693
I see.

492
00:57:32,072 --> 00:57:34,159
So good luck with that.

493
00:57:37,737 --> 00:57:40,550
We can't take a deposition against a lawyer.

494
00:57:41,903 --> 00:57:43,990
Unless we have a warrant for our arrest.

495
00:57:46,498 --> 00:57:51,825
I wonder what would happen if we took that statement instead of the report then.

496
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,239
Is it the same as this?

497
00:57:54,645 --> 00:57:56,705
It's too late.

498
00:57:57,431 --> 00:57:59,951
Why?
It's not like it was a year or two ago.

499
00:58:01,527 --> 00:58:03,227
But...

500
00:58:03,334 --> 00:58:04,600
Nothing you can't remember, right?

501
00:58:08,069 --> 00:58:09,589
At that time..

502
00:58:12,736 --> 00:58:13,909
Let me see.

503
00:58:18,648 --> 00:58:18,981
Oh.

504
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:25,256
Let me see.

505
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:29,305
Yeah, when I asked him what time he got home.

506
00:58:29,465 --> 00:58:29,845
What?

507
00:58:30,158 --> 00:58:31,098
I was a little concerned.

508
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:36,384
But then we caught the guy and I forgot about it.

509
00:58:39,815 --> 00:58:41,648
I'm sure he was just thinking about it.

510
00:58:43,858 --> 00:58:45,385
Yes his attitude..

511
00:58:47,111 --> 00:58:49,858
That was right after the incident, wasn't it?

512
00:58:56,387 --> 00:59:00,800
But I wasn't concerned about that.

513
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,712
We'll do a supplemental investigation.

514
00:59:10,476 --> 00:59:13,390
I think this case is all clear.

515
00:59:14,396 --> 00:59:15,070
But..

516
00:59:15,323 --> 00:59:18,596
But if you're not convinced yourself, go for it.

517
00:59:21,681 --> 00:59:26,994
But I doubt that the supplementary investigation will turn up a completely unexpected culprit.

518
00:59:28,928 --> 00:59:32,315
Wakita's trial for robbery and murder is proceeding apace.

519
00:59:32,789 --> 00:59:42,448
If another culprit turns up, it would be a stain on both the police and the police agency.

520
00:59:43,382 --> 00:59:46,196
On that point, I'm sure Wakita is the culprit.

521
00:59:46,886 --> 00:59:53,872
This supplemental investigation will clarify some of the ambiguities and uncertainties, and we hope to be convinced by the current indictment.

522
00:59:54,610 --> 00:59:56,443
That's how we see it.

523
00:59:56,710 --> 00:59:58,823
Go for it.

524
01:00:00,473 --> 01:00:02,460
Have you made up your mind yet?

525
01:00:04,077 --> 01:00:05,390
Hemorrhoid surgery.

526
01:00:06,711 --> 01:00:10,145
Tokyo has the best facilities.

527
01:00:12,848 --> 01:00:16,195
I hear the next scheduled transfer is quite significant.

528
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:24,602
I hear you're going to be the chief of detectives in Hiroshima.

529
01:00:26,796 --> 01:00:33,130
It's quite a bold move.
Good luck with your last job here.

530
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,233
Yes.

531
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:43,663
First of all, there's the death of the wife.

532
01:00:44,832 --> 01:00:48,792
I'm sure someone killed her.
Then who killed her?

533
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:54,073
There was no motive for her murder?

534
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:58,004
It is also possible to hold a grudge against another person due to borrowing money.

535
01:00:59,014 --> 01:01:02,601
Let's do a background check on her.

536
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:09,048
Your report says she remarried.

537
01:01:09,979 --> 01:01:16,213
She was widowed from her previous husband, and she remarried in 1954 to a Munakata.

538
01:01:18,878 --> 01:01:22,158
What was the reason for the marriage?

539
01:01:25,636 --> 01:01:28,403
She's the daughter of a very wealthy family.

540
01:01:29,081 --> 01:01:36,288
He worked on her father's property rights issue, and that was the beginning of their relationship.

541
01:01:37,084 --> 01:01:37,997
I see.

542
01:01:45,652 --> 01:01:47,972
Munakata must be quite old by now?

543
01:01:48,503 --> 01:01:49,909
He's 63?

544
01:01:51,004 --> 01:01:53,151
She was 37..

545
01:01:54,774 --> 01:02:01,294
She's been married once before.
It's not inconceivable that she's had other relationships.

546
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:05,123
You think so?

547
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:09,749
I see.

548
01:02:13,797 --> 01:02:15,210
Come to think of it.

549
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:16,943
Come to think of it?

550
01:02:18,629 --> 01:02:19,456
Nothing.

551
01:02:21,457 --> 01:02:23,043
Of course it's possible.

552
01:02:26,915 --> 01:02:27,888
Let's think about Hamano next.

553
01:02:29,523 --> 01:02:32,456
His attitude is strange.
He knows something.

554
01:02:33,628 --> 01:02:39,635
So to find out what he knows.
There's no way to start from scratch by looking at his behavior and condition before..

555
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:48,455
and after the crime, his relationship with Munakata, and more.

556
01:03:02,447 --> 01:03:03,567
What are you thinking about?

557
01:03:06,356 --> 01:03:07,096
Nothing.

558
01:03:09,283 --> 01:03:11,596
You've been looking a little better lately.

559
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,290
It's all about time.

560
01:03:29,617 --> 01:03:36,197
Every bad thing will fade and disappear with time.

561
01:03:41,162 --> 01:03:43,848
The best thing you can do is get this trial over with.

562
01:04:04,070 --> 01:04:10,970
I asked around about the Mrs. at various stores.

563
01:04:11,338 --> 01:04:12,758
But there were not strange things.

564
01:04:14,292 --> 01:04:19,585
I believed she only love his husband.

565
01:04:23,297 --> 01:04:30,197
Let's see about the Hamano.
What happened to his marriage proposal that broke down with the matchmaker, the president of Miyamoto Construction??

566
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:36,515
All we know is that she's the daughter of the manager of Nitto Kasei in Marunouchi.

567
01:04:36,845 --> 01:04:38,118
That's all we need to know.

568
01:04:38,924 --> 01:04:43,430
But you see, there are a total of 23 department heads at Nitto Kasei.

569
01:04:44,357 --> 01:04:50,797
According to the family register.
12 daughters of marriageable age.

570
01:04:52,572 --> 01:04:55,379
12 daughters of marriageable age.

571
01:04:56,565 --> 01:04:59,918
So you're going to have 12 or 20 people check each and every one of them.

572
01:05:01,884 --> 01:05:04,937
That's a lot of work for us.
We are not a detective.

573
01:05:06,723 --> 01:05:11,743
We are busy, and the chief's is not into about the case.

574
01:05:13,594 --> 01:05:17,247
Ok.
We'll handle this case.

575
01:05:30,038 --> 01:05:34,071
Excuse me, but didn't you have a marriage proposal last year?

576
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:36,451
With Hamano.

577
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:37,551
No.

578
01:05:38,035 --> 01:05:38,975
Thank you very much.

579
01:06:01,245 --> 01:06:06,199
In other words, why did Mr. Hamano and this marriage proposal suddenly break off? That's all there is to it.

580
01:06:09,109 --> 01:06:14,589
I understand why you don't want to talk about it.
It's not something that would cause you any trouble.

581
01:06:20,097 --> 01:06:21,723
Oh my god.

582
01:06:23,087 --> 01:06:26,267
As I said before, it was just a small matter.

583
01:06:27,677 --> 01:06:31,570
We didn't want you to come all the way to the Metropolitan Police Department for something like this.

584
01:06:36,378 --> 01:06:37,638
I got a letter.

585
01:06:40,094 --> 01:06:40,954
You got a letter?

586
01:06:41,434 --> 01:06:42,461
From Mr. Hamano?

587
01:06:43,491 --> 01:06:47,385
No.
From someone I don't know at all.

588
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:58,527
I couldn't bear to see the person who was about to marry Mr. Ichiro Hamano, so I took the liberty of writing to you.

589
01:06:59,546 --> 01:07:09,142
I don't know what kind of publicity Mr. Hamano, the matchmaker or the person himself, is talking about, but I know Mr. Hamano's past.

590
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:20,792
He has had a girlfriend since he was a student, and the relationship continues to this day, making it very difficult to resolve.

591
01:07:21,292 --> 01:07:27,951
I am sorry to hear of your unhappiness at the thought of marrying such a man.

592
01:07:28,629 --> 01:07:30,963
Please accept my sincere apologies.

593
01:07:31,498 --> 01:07:35,458
I will not mention my name for various reasons.

594
01:07:38,063 --> 01:07:40,830
The name is totally fictitious.
I also checked the address.

595
01:07:41,330 --> 01:07:42,750
Postmark's in Nihonbashi.

596
01:07:44,768 --> 01:07:46,581
Someone's interfering with Hamano's marriage.

597
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:50,108
Why would anyone want to interfere?

598
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:55,294
This letter would've been better if it was Mrs. Munakata.

599
01:07:57,431 --> 01:07:58,344
It's impossible.

600
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:02,610
It's easy work for us if so.

601
01:08:02,896 --> 01:08:05,576
It could happen.

602
01:08:08,478 --> 01:08:09,471
Look at this.

603
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:12,877
What's this?

604
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:17,763
Mrs. Munekata sent this manuscript to Weekly Woman magazine.

605
01:08:18,397 --> 01:08:23,224
It's a continuation from a little over a year ago.
It's a kind of travel guide.

606
01:08:24,024 --> 01:08:25,230
My home town.

607
01:08:26,817 --> 01:08:30,604
I was hoping you could do a handwriting analysis for me.

608
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,747
This would be great clue.

609
01:08:35,807 --> 01:08:37,500
Yeah.

610
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:44,203
This character "marriage" is an attempt to force the handwriting to look different. She's trying to make it different.

611
01:08:47,559 --> 01:08:51,813
The stroke order is exactly the same.

612
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:55,459
Are you sure it's the same person?

613
01:08:55,825 --> 01:08:57,212
There's no doubt about it.

614
01:09:04,142 --> 01:09:05,642
Unexpected things often happen.

615
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:13,611
Unexpected things often happen....but

616
01:09:16,516 --> 01:09:17,943
I'm surprised.

617
01:09:19,489 --> 01:09:22,135
But now we have a pretty good idea of what happened.

618
01:09:22,562 --> 01:09:23,669
Thanks.

619
01:09:26,224 --> 01:09:30,191
I'm sure she's doing something to harass Muramatsu's daughter as well.

620
01:09:32,283 --> 01:09:39,169
This is a completely unexpected turn of events.
I think we've reached a certain point in the investigation.

621
01:09:44,408 --> 01:09:46,262
It's going to be tricky.

622
01:09:47,849 --> 01:09:50,496
We have to be very careful.

623
01:09:52,021 --> 01:09:58,581
If it turns out later that she's not guilty  at all, it'll mean that the prosecutor's office has created a hell of a scandal.

624
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:01,838
I know.

625
01:10:02,807 --> 01:10:06,260
And moreover.

626
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:08,786
I don't think that's possible.

627
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:15,158
If she is the real culprit...
What does that mean?

628
01:10:19,502 --> 01:10:22,082
It would be a stain on the D.A.'s office.

629
01:10:23,005 --> 01:10:28,532
I'm telling you this because it's between you and me.
But it's also a personal matter for you.

630
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:33,401
You're gonna lose a lifetime.

631
01:10:39,058 --> 01:10:43,185
How many times have you confessed to Wakita's murder?

632
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:45,471
8th.

633
01:10:46,332 --> 01:10:49,538
The newspaper would say this.

634
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:59,984
Prosecutor's coercive interrogation of Wakita with no physical evidence
Whether he's guilty or not, We made him say so.

635
01:11:00,334 --> 01:11:02,354
But I still suspect him.

636
01:11:02,845 --> 01:11:05,418
The trial's on 14th, less than a week from now.

637
01:11:06,001 --> 01:11:12,641
Yeah. Well, we can't delay the investigation.
Get in touch with the D.A. and see what we can come up with as soon as possible.

638
01:11:16,382 --> 01:11:21,842
There're a lot.
Do you know how many inns and hotels there are in Sendagaya?

639
01:11:23,783 --> 01:11:27,883
And besides, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Gotanda...
I'm so frustrated.

640
01:11:32,936 --> 01:11:33,982
Well, let's do something about it!

641
01:11:37,432 --> 01:11:40,999
What about Muramatsu Yuki?

642
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:45,973
No, no, no, that can wait.
We'll have to corroborate the evidence against Mrs. and Hamano.

643
01:11:48,046 --> 01:11:48,659
I'm counting on you.

644
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:53,538
At this rate, it's going to take a time.

645
01:11:53,594 --> 01:11:55,220
We need more times.

646
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,733
Because the day after tomorrow is the final argument.

647
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,362
But please.

648
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,561
I extended the investigation once at your request the other day.

649
01:12:03,613 --> 01:12:05,220
The trial director agrees with me.

650
01:12:06,025 --> 01:12:11,012
I think this supplemental investigation is going to end up being a waste of your time and effort.

651
01:12:12,604 --> 01:12:15,410
I hope that's the case, somehow.

652
01:12:39,371 --> 01:12:47,123
Excuse me but.
I was wondering if you had received a letter similar to this one?

653
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:48,694
Not at all.

654
01:12:49,338 --> 01:12:50,198
Really?

655
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:55,273
Who wrote this terrible letter?

656
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:57,914
I was surprised.

657
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:02,910
I'm asking you again...
Have you ever received one of these before?

658
01:13:03,077 --> 01:13:04,557
Not at all.

659
01:13:07,286 --> 01:13:09,406
Anything else?

660
01:13:09,859 --> 01:13:11,072
I'm sorry.

661
01:13:12,106 --> 01:13:16,767
And, , as I asked you to do at the beginning, don not tell anyone.

662
01:13:17,405 --> 01:13:18,759
That's not going to happen.

663
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:23,691
I know this is just a harassing slander.

664
01:13:24,692 --> 01:13:28,839
If this were true, even our marriage would be in a bit of trouble.

665
01:13:31,068 --> 01:13:35,968
There is nothing untrue about this.
We can imagine who wrote it.

666
01:13:36,861 --> 01:13:39,455
I feel sorry for Hamano.

667
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,195
Can you vouch for me?

668
01:13:42,409 --> 01:13:43,616
Of course.

669
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:48,739
Then I won't tell anyone.
It would make both of us uncomfortable.

670
01:13:51,125 --> 01:13:52,292
Excuse me.

671
01:13:53,425 --> 01:13:54,332
Thanks

672
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:12,674
It is clear from the above evidence that

673
01:14:13,309 --> 01:14:18,286
its brutality, its cumulative criminality, and its negative impact on society.

674
01:14:19,161 --> 01:14:34,809
Based on the above three guidelines, I sentence the defendant in this case, Masayoshi Wakita, to death.

675
01:15:16,090 --> 01:15:17,817
Thanks for coming.

676
01:15:20,687 --> 01:15:24,265
Where shall we talk?

677
01:15:27,711 --> 01:15:29,937
I'll take you somewhere.

678
01:15:57,104 --> 01:15:59,502
I'm sorry, sir, but I'll have this cleaned up in no time.

679
01:16:01,174 --> 01:16:02,182
It's ok like that.

680
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:09,041
I've got a business meeting alone with him for the next two hours.

681
01:16:09,252 --> 01:16:10,759
Can I get you something to drink?

682
01:16:11,080 --> 01:16:12,845
After we're done talking.

683
01:16:12,978 --> 01:16:17,736
Yes, sir.
If you need me, please press the bell.

684
01:16:30,374 --> 01:16:33,460
Wakita's case is finally down to just the verdict.

685
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:35,343
Yes, it is.

686
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:43,265
As I told you on the phone.
I have my own opinion about the case.

687
01:16:43,757 --> 01:16:48,139
I've explained them to you. I'd like to hear your opinion.

688
01:16:49,101 --> 01:16:50,358
Go ahead.

689
01:16:53,515 --> 01:16:58,187
You know Fujiya Ryokan on Kamidori in Shibuya, right?

690
01:17:00,108 --> 01:17:05,522
Since last February, you have been going there two or three times a month.

691
01:17:07,444 --> 01:17:10,460
Mrs. Munakata, who passed away, accompanied you there.

692
01:17:12,116 --> 01:17:14,554
This is based on the testimony of the Fujiya Ryokan's maid.

693
01:17:16,890 --> 01:17:22,515
Then there is TOKIWA HOUSE near Sendagaya station.
You know this one too.

694
01:17:24,304 --> 01:17:30,210
Three or four years ago, you often visited there with her, but not since last year.

695
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,069
This is based on the testimony of the Tokiwa house's maid.

696
01:17:35,444 --> 01:17:45,147
Taken together, there was a physical relationship between you and Mrs. Munakata for several years.

697
01:17:47,014 --> 01:17:48,225
I hope you acknowledge this fact.

698
01:17:48,522 --> 01:17:49,248
Ochiai.

699
01:17:52,670 --> 01:17:54,350
Here's not police.

700
01:17:59,217 --> 01:18:02,365
Yes, this is not the prosecutor's office or the police.

701
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,225
This is a private discussion between us.

702
01:18:05,858 --> 01:18:10,295
But isn't this a bit much for a private discussion?

703
01:18:13,342 --> 01:18:18,529
Then I'll have a warrant prepared for your arrest, and we'll discuss it in my office, taking notes.
Is that better?

704
01:18:25,070 --> 01:18:26,789
Then I have your permission to continue.

705
01:18:30,438 --> 01:18:36,391
Since last fall, you've been in talks to marry a woman named Fusako Ooi.

706
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:41,859
Mrs. Munakata's defamatory letter unilaterally broke off your marriage.

707
01:18:43,367 --> 01:18:46,820
I have Mrs. Munakata's letter from that time.

708
01:18:49,477 --> 01:19:00,188
Not only Fusako Ooi, but a few years ago there was an incident similar to this with Yoshiko Kondo, with whom you had been dating since you were a student.

709
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:02,984
I have no doubt about this either.

710
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:12,945
Next, please tell me specifically about your actions on January 17, the day of the incident.

711
01:19:27,214 --> 01:19:29,683
You left your apartment at approximately 8:00 a.m.

712
01:19:30,675 --> 01:19:36,910
From 10:00 a.m., you attended the 4th trial of your case at the Tokyo District Court, Courtroom No. 7.

713
01:19:37,605 --> 01:19:40,245
It ended at 11:30 a.m.

714
01:19:42,096 --> 01:19:51,557
Now, would you please recall what you were doing between 11:30 and 8:20 at night when you went to the Munakata home?

715
01:20:03,562 --> 01:20:05,671
It was about three months ago.

716
01:20:07,038 --> 01:20:11,304
However, this was the day of the murder of Mrs. Munakata, a very serious incident.

717
01:20:12,632 --> 01:20:17,773
Naturally, you have many memories of it, and I am sure it will not be too difficult for you to recall it.

718
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:32,983
If it is difficult for you to say so, let me say it for you.

719
01:20:34,647 --> 01:20:40,061
You met with Mr. Yuki Muramatsu that afternoon or evening.

720
01:20:45,158 --> 01:20:45,962
Hello?

721
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,665
We had a long meeting after the trial.

722
01:20:54,908 --> 01:20:56,064
What's wrong?

723
01:21:10,001 --> 01:21:11,657
Read this.

724
01:21:36,380 --> 01:21:37,294
Who's her?

725
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:44,709
Do you know her?

726
01:21:47,935 --> 01:21:51,560
Why are you silent?

727
01:21:59,823 --> 01:22:03,737
Ms. Muramatsu is denying everything.

728
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:12,612
But if she would come to the Prosecutor's Office and sit at my desk.
I'm sure we can clear this up.

729
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,181
Am I wrong?

730
01:22:17,775 --> 01:22:23,556
What did you do when Yuki-san showed you Mrs. Munekata's letter, and you felt intense disappointment and anger?

731
01:22:24,713 --> 01:22:27,814
Anyway, you arrive at the Munakata house at 8:20 p.m.

732
01:22:30,564 --> 01:22:36,181
The maid left to reserve food about 10 minutes later at 8:30 p.m.

733
01:22:38,588 --> 01:22:43,478
So it was just you and Mrs. Munakata alone in the Munakata house.

734
01:22:46,024 --> 01:22:49,196
What went on in the Munakata house?

735
01:22:55,391 --> 01:22:59,594
I have proof of everything up to this point.

736
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:07,266
But I can honestly say that there is nothing certain about the future.

737
01:23:10,788 --> 01:23:16,147
And no matter what kind of investigation we do in the future, it will probably turn up nothing.

738
01:23:17,718 --> 01:23:22,788
It's just my eternal conjecture that this is what happened.

739
01:23:26,315 --> 01:23:32,252
When the maid left, you scolded her vehemently.

740
01:23:34,244 --> 01:23:42,291
She objected.
Naturally, a fierce struggle ensued between the two of you, during which you lost your temper.

741
01:23:42,526 --> 01:23:47,010
You wrapped your wife's neck with the red waistband and killed her.

742
01:23:49,651 --> 01:23:54,401
And a little after 9:10, you left.

743
01:23:57,791 --> 01:23:58,440
Here's what I'm thinking.

744
01:24:01,996 --> 01:24:06,145
I'd like to know your opinion whether I'm wrong or not.

745
01:24:09,387 --> 01:24:17,691
One word is all I ask.
I'd like to know if I'm missing the point, or if it's more accurate than I thought.

746
01:24:23,158 --> 01:24:24,088
What do you think?

747
01:24:32,768 --> 01:24:36,581
My relationship with her is complicated.

748
01:24:39,151 --> 01:24:41,948
But I didn't kill her.

749
01:24:52,469 --> 01:25:01,308
I see.
That's enough.

750
01:25:05,043 --> 01:25:12,386
I still believe that the culprit is Wakita.

751
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:18,715
I'm sorry for asking so many rude questions.

752
01:25:32,871 --> 01:25:34,153
But...

753
01:25:35,918 --> 01:25:38,926
I have one more question, just to be sure.

754
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:49,712
About this case...
You acted in a way that aroused certain suspicions in me and Mr. Hirao.

755
01:25:50,509 --> 01:25:52,806
This is an undeniable fact.

756
01:25:54,306 --> 01:26:03,368
Actually, not only Hirao-kun and I, but there is one other person who suspects you.

757
01:26:06,197 --> 01:26:07,931
That's Muramatsu Yuki-san.

758
01:26:10,762 --> 01:26:18,629
When I met Ms. Muramatsu I frankly showed her the letter Mrs. Muramatsu had sent to Ms. Fusako Ooi.

759
01:26:20,473 --> 01:26:24,113
However, Ms. Muramatsu was not that surprised.

760
01:26:25,317 --> 01:26:26,520
I was astonished.

761
01:26:28,153 --> 01:26:31,254
It says terrible things about the man she's  going to marry.

762
01:26:32,278 --> 01:26:35,645
However, Ms. Muramatsu was not that surprised.

763
01:26:37,773 --> 01:26:53,460
However, she didn't show much of an emotional response to it.
This means, of course, that she has seen this same letter before.

764
01:26:56,132 --> 01:27:01,976
Perhaps Ms. Muramatsu thought that the owner of this letter could be none other than Mrs. Munakata.

765
01:27:03,187 --> 01:27:06,594
I suspect that she made such an assumption right after the incident.

766
01:27:10,387 --> 01:27:14,223
Think back carefully.

767
01:27:16,043 --> 01:27:21,043
What has Ms. Muramatsu said to you since the incident?

768
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,199
I don't know how the word she used.

769
01:27:27,371 --> 01:27:36,871
But the meaning is a necessary question that perhaps you are not the culprit.

770
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:47,304
At other times, for example, even if you are the culprit, someone else has already been clearly identified as the culprit.

771
01:27:48,046 --> 01:27:55,156
Don't dwell on it.
I think that's what she meant.

772
01:27:58,863 --> 01:28:00,777
She's beautiful and clever.

773
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,488
No, too clever.

774
01:28:07,535 --> 01:28:14,957
Anyway, I, Hirao-kun, Muramatsu-san, and myself had our own reasons for suspecting you.

775
01:28:16,855 --> 01:28:21,222
Why did you act in a way that arouses the suspicions of these three people?

776
01:28:23,379 --> 01:28:30,332
It's just a feeling of regret from your special relationship with the ladies, that's all.

777
01:28:31,465 --> 01:28:45,894
Or is there some other reason?
If there was, what would it be? I'd like you to explain yourself.

778
01:28:52,863 --> 01:29:05,425
Normally, whatever special relationship you had with her, she's dead, and that's okay.

779
01:29:07,402 --> 01:29:13,668
I'm talking about a hypothetical.

780
01:29:15,613 --> 01:29:20,832
Even if you had killed her, we already know who else would have done it.

781
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:26,434
It is natural for humans today to hide it.

782
01:29:29,606 --> 01:29:33,910
but you couldn't do it.

783
01:29:35,949 --> 01:29:46,035
This is not just a matter of guilt, but I still think it's a matter of human conscience.

784
01:29:49,135 --> 01:29:52,073
Your conscience made you do it.

785
01:29:54,955 --> 01:30:01,245
Please swear on your conscience again, please say it one more time.

786
01:30:03,682 --> 01:30:10,564
You've been troubled by your special relationship with her, and you've done things that have aroused suspicion in others.

787
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:17,557
But you had nothing to do with the murder, only with the killing.

788
01:30:20,151 --> 01:30:23,284
I won't ask you again.
Just one word ok.

789
01:30:26,807 --> 01:30:35,276
I don't care what your motives are. I would never think of you as a murderer, no matter what the motive.

790
01:30:36,041 --> 01:30:37,596
I can't believe it.

791
01:30:38,909 --> 01:30:44,268
And if I'm wrong about this...

792
01:30:45,557 --> 01:30:53,041
Wakita cannot be given the death penalty even if he has a criminal record.

793
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:55,020
Ochiai.

794
01:30:57,106 --> 01:31:03,730
Wakita wasn't the one who killed her.

795
01:31:04,426 --> 01:31:08,043
I'm the one who killed her.

796
01:31:29,699 --> 01:31:31,433
It's too late.

797
01:31:33,129 --> 01:31:35,879
It's all about the aftermath.

798
01:31:38,246 --> 01:31:43,840
I'll take responsibility for the accusations and accusations against the DA's office.

799
01:31:45,896 --> 01:31:51,677
But as for you personally, you'll have to think about that yourself from now on.

800
01:31:59,543 --> 01:32:03,347
The pursuit of truth is a difficult thing.

801
01:32:42,972 --> 01:32:48,441
Frankly speaking, I think there is a problem with the attitude of the prosecutor in charge.

802
01:32:48,996 --> 01:33:06,417
I think that once a prosecutor's office makes a decision, they tend to have a mentality that they are going to stick to that decision forever.

803
01:33:07,558 --> 01:33:16,659
But I think the problem lies in the strength of the spirit of pursuit of the truth.

804
01:33:17,043 --> 01:33:22,949
I think this Prosecutor Ochiai's attitude is admirable in that respect.

805
01:33:29,682 --> 01:33:33,565
You've always had a penchant for strange things, even as a student.

806
01:33:34,089 --> 01:33:38,815
Oxtails.
If you ask Kikuya, he'll bring you some.

807
01:33:41,206 --> 01:33:43,854
You have to eat something.

808
01:34:01,013 --> 01:34:04,396
You never know what you're going to get when you open it.

809
01:34:05,544 --> 01:34:10,849
I thought I was in for a hell of a lot of pain and terrible criticism.
I was like PR for the D.A.'s office.

810
01:34:12,076 --> 01:34:18,107
The world has changed, hasn't it?
The pursuit of truth is more important than the fear of making a mistake on the job.

811
01:34:19,068 --> 01:34:24,341
My ideas are out of date.
Maybe I was a little too clever.

812
01:34:24,412 --> 01:34:25,357
No way.

813
01:34:26,779 --> 01:34:38,497
us to appear on their Saturday show, "Visit This Person".

814
01:34:38,607 --> 01:34:40,373
I see.

815
01:34:41,826 --> 01:34:43,130
What's the motive?

816
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:46,560
You've done a supplemental investigation.

817
01:34:48,763 --> 01:34:54,209
First of all, the time of Mrs.'s death, which means the time of the crime.

818
01:34:54,904 --> 01:35:01,138
The real murderer had a guilty conscience and was ready to confess.

819
01:35:01,873 --> 01:35:04,396
I think Hamano is very admirable.

820
01:35:04,552 --> 01:35:07,740
All he had to do was say he didn't know anything.
All would be fine.

821
01:35:08,037 --> 01:35:16,091
Yeah.
Wakita is just like that. He's saying he did it on his own.

822
01:35:33,289 --> 01:35:35,968
Good Morning.

823
01:35:40,601 --> 01:35:41,468
Good Morning.

824
01:35:42,866 --> 01:35:43,765
Good Morning.

825
01:35:57,767 --> 01:35:59,017
Good Morning.

826
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:03,434
Good Morning.

827
01:36:03,879 --> 01:36:04,668
Good Morning.

828
01:36:05,075 --> 01:36:06,246
This is awesome.

829
01:36:06,840 --> 01:36:08,489
I saw you on TV.

830
01:36:08,614 --> 01:36:09,934
You did?

831
01:36:12,395 --> 01:36:17,762
My wife was impressed by how open and friendly you were.

832
01:36:18,606 --> 01:36:21,036
You were like a celebrity.

833
01:36:22,879 --> 01:36:31,512
You know, on TV, everyone wears makeup.
I hope it wasn't too weird.

834
01:36:31,801 --> 01:36:33,278
It was so great.

835
01:36:40,510 --> 01:36:41,197
Come in.

836
01:36:46,854 --> 01:36:48,182
This is express mail.

837
01:36:55,109 --> 01:36:59,960
Takigami, Monbetsu-gun, Hokkaido
Koichi Ishikawa

838
01:37:01,523 --> 01:37:03,070
I don't know him.

839
01:37:03,742 --> 01:37:05,062
Koichi Ishikawa..

840
01:37:08,335 --> 01:37:16,757
I would like to express my deepest respect for the work you are doing day and night in pursuit of the truth.

841
01:37:17,367 --> 01:37:20,140
Today I saw you on TV.

842
01:37:21,015 --> 01:37:25,195
I guess everyone watches TV, I'm afraid I can't do anything bad

843
01:37:26,781 --> 01:37:33,640
Seeing you on TV, I have the utmost respect for your hard work and efforts.

844
01:37:34,398 --> 01:37:37,960
By the way, I used to be a great admirer of Mr. Munakata......

845
01:38:57,457 --> 01:38:59,121
Are you Koichi Ishikawa?

846
01:38:59,926 --> 01:39:02,762
I'm Ochiai from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Thank you for coming all the way from afar.

847
01:39:05,051 --> 01:39:09,793
You said in your letter that you had a relationship with Munekata.

848
01:39:10,864 --> 01:39:17,465
Four or five years ago my brother was involved with him in a fraud case.

849
01:39:17,887 --> 01:39:21,215
He helped us a lot.

850
01:39:22,051 --> 01:39:28,075
Since then, every time I come to Tokyo, I visit him with a gift to thank him for his kindness.

851
01:39:29,145 --> 01:39:29,645
So?

852
01:39:30,036 --> 01:39:33,762
So I arrived in Tokyo on January 15th.

853
01:39:34,379 --> 01:39:37,598
I was also on a business trip for my company
I had a lot of things to do.

854
01:39:38,606 --> 01:39:41,442
I couln't visit him.

855
01:39:42,746 --> 01:39:47,215
I called him before I left just to say hello.

856
01:39:48,317 --> 01:39:50,223
You did that from the inn?

857
01:39:50,934 --> 01:39:51,575
Yes.

858
01:39:52,692 --> 01:39:53,450
What inn is it called?

859
01:39:53,871 --> 01:39:54,965
Yamashiro inn.

860
01:39:56,840 --> 01:39:58,567
You first called at 9:00.?

861
01:39:58,942 --> 01:40:00,661
That's right.
Would you excuse me for a moment?

862
01:40:01,082 --> 01:40:02,887
That's the correct time?

863
01:40:03,371 --> 01:40:06,145
Customer number 10 is calling.

864
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:08,496
And the phone was busy?

865
01:40:08,715 --> 01:40:13,278
I tried every minute or two, but it was busy.

866
01:40:15,231 --> 01:40:21,996
It was so strange.
I thought maybe their phone was malfunctioning, so I called the station.

867
01:40:22,661 --> 01:40:24,020
What time did you call the telephone station?

868
01:40:24,786 --> 01:40:26,786
Let me see.

869
01:40:28,528 --> 01:40:33,473
At that time, you said that the only way to get to the train was from there, 20 minutes away.

870
01:40:34,106 --> 01:40:38,301
Yeah, it wasn't closer to 9:30.

871
01:40:38,879 --> 01:40:39,817
What did the telephone station say?

872
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:42,543
I'll look into it. Please wait a moment.

873
01:40:44,434 --> 01:40:47,981
It wasn't more than two or three minutes.

874
01:40:48,536 --> 01:40:52,309
I noted that the receiver was off the other end of the line.

875
01:40:53,293 --> 01:40:55,692
The receiver was off the other end of the line?

876
01:40:59,082 --> 01:41:01,684
So I wonder who picked up the phone on the other end.

877
01:41:04,317 --> 01:41:06,239
So you called again?

878
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:19,292
I tried calling.
But this time, instead of being busy, I get a call signal, but no one answers the phone.

879
01:41:24,894 --> 01:41:28,613
If the receiver is disconnected, we'll send a signal.

880
01:41:40,830 --> 01:41:41,822
Look at this.

881
01:41:54,671 --> 01:41:58,921
That's where the other person answer.
We give him a warning.

882
01:41:59,772 --> 01:42:05,913
So in the case of 4611, when the signal was given, someone on the other end answered, right?

883
01:42:06,108 --> 01:42:07,014
Yes.

884
01:42:08,647 --> 01:42:10,248
What did it sound like?

885
01:42:10,787 --> 01:42:11,545
It was a woman.

886
01:42:12,264 --> 01:42:12,975
It was a woman?

887
01:42:14,115 --> 01:42:16,717
Did the woman say anything?

888
01:42:17,092 --> 01:42:18,889
Just a word.

889
01:42:19,405 --> 01:42:20,076
What did she say?

890
01:42:20,912 --> 01:42:21,709
 I'm sorry.

891
01:42:28,593 --> 01:42:36,195
Between 9:26 and 9:28.
The woman responded to your attention.

892
01:42:38,692 --> 01:42:40,263
That's Mrs. Munekata, isn't it?

893
01:42:47,903 --> 01:42:48,583
Here?

894
01:42:49,356 --> 01:42:49,825
Yes.

895
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:52,763
I see.
What time did you see Mr. Hamano?

896
01:42:53,231 --> 01:42:54,638
About 9:10.

897
01:42:55,114 --> 01:42:57,161
How do you remember the time so precisely?

898
01:42:57,739 --> 01:43:03,911
Because I came home in a hurry to watch the 9:15 oriental featherweight title on TV.

899
01:43:05,730 --> 01:43:11,504
When I put my car in the back storage and came out of the store, the news was still on the previous program, not a commercial.

900
01:43:13,528 --> 01:43:19,317
It's absolutely impossible for something once completely dead to have come up for air.

901
01:43:20,544 --> 01:43:24,973
But people often mistake the fainting state for death.

902
01:43:25,841 --> 01:43:28,028
At first glance, they look almost dead.

903
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,231
Does it last for 20 or 30 minutes?

904
01:43:32,567 --> 01:43:36,216
Normally, it would be more like 30 or 40 minutes.

905
01:43:36,638 --> 01:43:41,497
So Mrs. Munakata was in a coma until 9:27, 8:00.

906
01:43:43,638 --> 01:43:45,809
So she was alive, at least until then.

907
01:43:56,614 --> 01:44:00,919
From Meguro to his apartment in Sugamo.

908
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:03,286
Then the maid found Mrs. Munekata's corpse at about 10:05.

909
01:44:03,311 --> 01:44:05,161
I get it.
I get it.

910
01:44:05,749 --> 01:44:11,960
That's why.
I don't know why the lawyer said all those strange things, but it's just gibberish.

911
01:44:13,795 --> 01:44:15,168
I understand now.

912
01:44:18,263 --> 01:44:21,729
But that lawyer's an idiot.

913
01:44:21,975 --> 01:44:25,669
I told him I did it myself, so he should keep quiet.

914
01:44:25,962 --> 01:44:27,075
It's none of your business.

915
01:44:30,260 --> 01:44:30,800
Wakita!

916
01:44:35,139 --> 01:44:38,392
I'm the only one who could do it.

917
01:44:39,711 --> 01:44:42,738
If I talked about the phone call... I'd get yelled at for being an idiot.

918
01:44:43,835 --> 01:44:44,742
You!

919
01:44:51,403 --> 01:44:54,689
Listen,
That room was the only bright one.

920
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:59,213
I pushed the door open.

921
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:18,932
I was crazy about it. I was jumping at her, but...

922
01:45:20,131 --> 01:45:26,504
I got a phone call that I didn't expect.
And I jumped on her.

923
01:45:29,721 --> 01:45:34,528
I don't know about the first she said "I'm sorry" on the phone.

924
01:45:35,209 --> 01:45:38,749
I came in after she put the receiver back on the phone.

925
01:45:47,847 --> 01:45:52,854
I've done a lot of rough stuff in my day.
But this is the first time I've killed someone.

926
01:47:09,932 --> 01:47:10,799
Are you in pain?

927
01:47:20,455 --> 01:47:23,915
But I'm glad you did.
Doctor cut off your hemorrhoids while you are here.

928
01:47:24,623 --> 01:47:29,370
You were always complaining about your hemorrhoids hurting every day.

929
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:37,100
Cheer up.
It's just that when they looked into it, they found one new fact after another.

930
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:39,757
It's not your fault.

931
01:47:41,007 --> 01:47:44,234
You don't have to worry about your transfer.

932
01:47:45,872 --> 01:47:51,365
No one thinks you're the kind of person who'll make it to the attorney general's office.

933
01:48:03,753 --> 01:48:04,360
You.

934
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:07,473
Hamano.

935
01:48:13,206 --> 01:48:14,153
Come in.

936
01:48:21,867 --> 01:48:22,873
Come in.

937
01:48:28,587 --> 01:48:30,381
This is something small.

938
01:48:33,481 --> 01:48:35,301
This is from him.

939
01:48:38,569 --> 01:48:39,529
I'll get out.

940
01:48:42,462 --> 01:48:43,582
Come in.

941
01:48:44,330 --> 01:48:46,143
I have to go squeeze some apples.

942
01:48:47,130 --> 01:48:48,036
I'll be right out.

943
01:48:48,190 --> 01:48:49,243
Don't worry.

944
01:48:54,163 --> 01:48:55,363
Have a seat.

945
01:49:10,970 --> 01:49:13,236
When did you make bail?

946
01:49:13,816 --> 01:49:14,483
13th.

947
01:49:17,397 --> 01:49:18,384
The day before yesterday.

948
01:49:48,810 --> 01:49:51,103
What are you going to do now?

949
01:49:54,826 --> 01:49:57,546
I'm going back to my home.

950
01:50:06,036 --> 01:50:07,376
Are you in pain?

951
01:50:23,034 --> 01:50:26,194
How is Mr. Munakata?

952
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:37,353
I heard he went home from the hospital and he's getting better.

953
01:50:45,588 --> 01:50:51,248
I've heard a little bit about you.
Are you suddenly transferred to Kushiro this time?

954
01:50:55,831 --> 01:50:58,018
It's too far from Tokyo.

955
01:51:06,284 --> 01:51:07,971
How's Yuki Muramatsu?

956
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:10,032
Did you see her after that?

957
01:51:11,414 --> 01:51:14,680
No.
She left for France.

958
01:51:16,402 --> 01:51:17,182
France?

959
01:51:25,625 --> 01:51:27,639
She's a fine young lady, isn't she?

960
01:51:37,467 --> 01:51:42,787
I bet she thought to herself as she flew out of Haneda like that.

961
01:51:44,607 --> 01:51:48,121
There are two stupid men in Japan.

962
01:51:54,544 --> 01:51:55,684
Ochiai.

963
01:51:56,984 --> 01:52:00,038
I see.
You and I are both idiots.

964
01:52:02,071 --> 01:52:06,497
But you know what, I'm fine with stupid.

965
01:52:26,834 --> 01:52:27,701
Ochiai.

966
01:52:31,794 --> 01:52:32,767
Take care.

967
01:52:37,291 --> 01:52:38,517
Take care of yourself too.

968
01:53:04,928 --> 01:53:11,047
Lawyer Hamano commits suicide at a inn in Kofu.

969
01:53:15,177 --> 01:53:29,353
THE END

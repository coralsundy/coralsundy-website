00:00:12,516 --> 00:00:22,195
BURY ME DEEP

3
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:22,352
Hello?

4
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,992
What?

5
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,109
Where are you coming from?

6
00:01:24,383 --> 00:01:25,297
I come from Tokyo

7
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:28,156
You sound like a country person.

8
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,914
I was in Kyushu on vacation

9
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,508
After all, Tokyo people are no good in the countryside.

10
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,469
I was supposed to be on vacation for half a month, but I cut it short after a week and came back.

11
00:01:35,494 --> 00:01:37,092
I see

12
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:41,311
I want to take a hot spring in Kyushu as long as I have money

13
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:44,600
People in Tokyo miss the lights and noise of this city

14
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:46,264
Have you changed in Tokyo?

15
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,788
Stocks crashed

16
00:01:48,116 --> 00:01:50,459
There were many suicides

17
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:53,123
That's a life

18
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:57,358
Life is more fun with such events!

19
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:40,733
Who are you?

20
00:02:46,084 --> 00:02:46,725
Hey

21
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,584
Why you are here?

22
00:02:52,897 --> 00:02:53,983
Oh

23
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,467
Welcome back home

24
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:00,022
You back home late

25
00:03:00,256 --> 00:03:01,803
No, I back home early

26
00:03:09,178 --> 00:03:12,280
So tell me who you are

27
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,170
Don't pretend you don't know

28
00:03:14,733 --> 00:03:16,491
Do you want to drink?

29
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,053
Unfortunately I hate brandy

30
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,045
I only drink scotch

31
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:25,905
I have no idea

32
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:27,975
I think something is wrong

33
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:30,123
You are Nakabe,aren't you?

34
00:03:30,936 --> 00:03:32,428
Yes I am

35
00:03:32,997 --> 00:03:34,395
So I'm right

36
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:38,998
I don't know what you are doing

37
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,061
I am a lawyer

38
00:03:41,147 --> 00:03:43,233
That's scary job

39
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:46,717
You have a plan for what you're going to do.

40
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:51,576
Let's be with me tonight

41
00:03:53,881 --> 00:03:55,350
Let's be with me tonight

42
00:03:55,545 --> 00:03:57,248
I have no idea

43
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:00,045
You know what

44
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:01,381
You smell good

45
00:04:01,406 --> 00:04:02,732
What kind of perfume do you use?

46
00:04:02,795 --> 00:04:05,193
It ’s a Parisian perfume called Disaster

47
00:04:06,022 --> 00:04:08,350
It ’s a disaster in Japanese.

48
00:04:08,608 --> 00:04:11,045
That's a disaster for which I am grateful.

49
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:12,655
I'm worried about what will happen after this

50
00:04:14,436 --> 00:04:15,608
He's coming

51
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:20,475
We can show off him

52
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:26,319
Excuse me but I came to collect rent

53
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:29,467
I'm sorry to bother you

54
00:04:29,522 --> 00:04:30,655
I'll come tomorrow

55
00:04:33,202 --> 00:04:36,248
He was the superintendent.

56
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,139
Let's start

57
00:04:41,444 --> 00:04:42,592
For what?

58
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:44,451
Good things

59
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:58,834
Oh!

60
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,514
Are you OK?

61
00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:01,935
Take me

62
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,202
I want you to go home now

63
00:05:06,092 --> 00:05:07,483
Put on your cloth

64
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,413
Hey!

65
00:05:11,803 --> 00:05:14,491
You can't sleep here

66
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:15,678
Hey!

67
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,428
Give me some water

68
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,413
Water?

69
00:05:22,913 --> 00:05:24,616
Give me some water

70
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:30,694
Here is your water

71
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,210
Don't sleep

72
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:43,460
Wake up!

73
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,913
Wake up!

74
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:47,389
Oh my god

75
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,296
Tell me where do you live?

76
00:06:00,577 --> 00:06:03,624
Tokyo apartment room 7

77
00:06:04,218 --> 00:06:05,538
This is where I am now

78
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:10,093
She's up to some mischief.

79
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:27,811
Hello?
I'm Nakabe in Tokyo apartment

80
00:06:27,968 --> 00:06:29,327
Can you send me a cab?

81
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:30,765
How long does it take?

82
00:06:31,499 --> 00:06:32,624
3 mins, I see, thanks

83
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,882
Put on cloth

84
00:06:50,015 --> 00:06:55,257
We are here as promised to take pictures of your love scenes.

85
00:06:55,335 --> 00:06:56,179
What?

86
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,030
Who did this mischief?

87
00:06:58,108 --> 00:07:02,999
We detectives do not leak personal information

88
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:07,483
There is a beautiful woman here and we will take her picture

89
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:09,569
No one here. go home!

90
00:07:09,647 --> 00:07:10,866
Don't make fun of me

91
00:07:11,374 --> 00:07:14,061
I'm here for work

92
00:07:14,086 --> 00:07:15,999
No one here. go home!

93
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:20,053
Damn it, they come here to take a photo. that's bullshit

94
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:29,491
I’m sorry to have kept you waiting

95
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:31,436
What's wrong?

96
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,155
She's drunker

97
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:37,210
Those customers are unwelcome

98
00:07:37,374 --> 00:07:40,741
If she doesn't wake up, take her to the police

99
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:42,991
This is the money

100
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,483
Leave it to you

101
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,100
Oh my god

102
00:08:18,007 --> 00:08:18,936
Where is Michi

103
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,452
I sent her by cab

104
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:23,663
Don't tell a lie.
She is hiding somewhere

105
00:08:28,718 --> 00:08:30,468
Who are you by the way?

106
00:08:31,468 --> 00:08:33,538
Hey, I'm a lawyer

107
00:08:34,913 --> 00:08:37,780
I will sue you for illegal invasion

108
00:08:41,718 --> 00:08:45,827
It smells of her perfume.
Where is her?

109
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,655
She's my girl.
Don't play with her anymore!

110
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:56,515
Who is he?

111
00:08:58,499 --> 00:09:01,319
Today is a very strange night

112
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:03,569
This is what Tokyo is

113
00:09:09,999 --> 00:09:11,999
Tokyo is too exciting

114
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:17,632
I wonder I can go to sleep

115
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:28,757
It was a disaster

116
00:09:38,374 --> 00:09:39,757
It was a disaster

117
00:09:40,874 --> 00:09:43,522
Is it English or French?

118
00:09:45,179 --> 00:09:46,616
It was a disaster

119
00:09:57,772 --> 00:09:59,030
Hey, wake up!

120
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,038
Hey, wake up!

121
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,569
Who are you guys?

122
00:10:11,046 --> 00:10:12,960
I'm Inspector Takeda of the Metropolitan Police Department

123
00:10:15,186 --> 00:10:15,991
Police?

124
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:18,405
Did something happen?

125
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:22,740
Look, Is the man?

126
00:10:23,233 --> 00:10:24,702
Yes he is

127
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,741
What's wrong?

128
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,460
Oh you are the...

129
00:10:31,257 --> 00:10:32,218
What's wrong?

130
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:37,702
I took sleeping pills.
Did you get up?

131
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:39,483
No...

132
00:10:39,508 --> 00:10:41,397
She's still sleeping

133
00:10:41,749 --> 00:10:44,061
It means you died in the car

134
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:45,007
Eh?

135
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:48,804
What did you make her drink?

136
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:51,608
I didn't.
She was drunk

137
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:52,257
What?

138
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,874
That

139
00:10:56,007 --> 00:10:57,077
This alcohol

140
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:58,788
She was drinking this

141
00:10:59,671 --> 00:11:00,936
Is this yours?

142
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,054
She brought this in

143
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,390
Please come to the police station anyway

144
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:11,960
I don't understand what you say.
She was drinking alone in the apartment

145
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:14,218
She obviously came to your room

146
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:18,577
It is incongruous that you do not know it.

147
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:21,085
I still have a headache because of sleeping pills

148
00:11:21,515 --> 00:11:23,475
Yes that's right.
That's incongruous

149
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:25,429
I have no idea

150
00:11:25,515 --> 00:11:27,311
Why she came in your room?

151
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,233
I'm sure Mr. Akutagawa forgot to lock it.

152
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,311
Mr. Akutagawa?

153
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,679
He has been a friend of mine since childhood

154
00:11:36,788 --> 00:11:42,827
He is a sergeant in a trading company called Akutagawa Bussan.

155
00:11:44,124 --> 00:11:46,632
I lent him the key and rented the room

156
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:48,374
For love affair?

157
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:52,843
He was discussing divorce with his wife

158
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:58,116
He stayed at a friend's house or hotel instead of going home

159
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:00,905
So She was his lover?

160
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,718
I think so

161
00:12:03,743 --> 00:12:05,897
As a result of the inspection, this was included in that brandy

162
00:12:06,382 --> 00:12:08,233
There was a chloran

163
00:12:08,858 --> 00:12:12,132
This is a medicine that makes you sleepy and faint

164
00:12:13,725 --> 00:12:15,741
Are you sure that Brandy is not yours?

165
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:21,757
I am not a brandy drinker. I have never bought one.

166
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,452
Why was it in your room?

167
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:26,538
You make me say the same thing over and over again

168
00:12:26,702 --> 00:12:28,788
She brought it in or something

169
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,890
It's your job to find out

170
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,436
Detective man and cameraman Then a strange man came in

171
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:39,390
Do you remember them?

172
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:40,952
Yes I do

173
00:12:41,202 --> 00:12:45,015
If they really came here to take pictures, there must be a reason.

174
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:48,178
We should investigate Akutagawa first

175
00:12:49,124 --> 00:12:50,545
Will you help us?

176
00:12:57,929 --> 00:12:58,913
Please come in

177
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,382
Welcome Nakabe-san
You come earlier

178
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:22,061
I came back to Tokyo last night

179
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:24,491
He is Inspector Takeda of the Metropolitan Police Department

180
00:13:24,647 --> 00:13:25,647
Nice to meet you

181
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,866
Please have a seat

182
00:13:30,327 --> 00:13:31,819
Is something happened?

183
00:13:31,952 --> 00:13:36,507
A woman died in my apartment last night

184
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:38,608
Oh

185
00:13:38,968 --> 00:13:40,483
I don't know her at all

186
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:42,694
Why she was his room?

187
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:46,561
We don't know well.
I thought she was a friend of your husband

188
00:13:46,999 --> 00:13:50,929
He used my room while I was away

189
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,194
That is what I came to ask you about.

190
00:13:54,569 --> 00:13:55,350
Where is your husband?

191
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:57,600
He's been away for a while

192
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:58,327
Why?

193
00:13:59,124 --> 00:14:00,632
That's a very rude question

194
00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:04,905
It's Ok.
We were talking about divorce

195
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:09,421
What is the cause of your divorce?
He has mistress?

196
00:14:10,085 --> 00:14:11,007
Stop saying it

197
00:14:11,319 --> 00:14:12,975
Do you know a woman called Michi

198
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:19,749
I don't know her.
He's lonely and like women, but he doesn't have a mistress

199
00:14:19,952 --> 00:14:22,140
Do you know where he is now?

200
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:23,632
I have no idea

201
00:14:25,663 --> 00:14:28,929
I'm sorry to hear that it's very rude.
We are leaving now

202
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,679
Are you leaving now?

203
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,647
We'll see you soon

204
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,608
I didn't sleep last night

205
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,304
You can't sleep today

206
00:14:39,468 --> 00:14:41,186
There are many newspaper reporters in front of your apartment

207
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,171
There are many newspaper reporters

208
00:14:43,218 --> 00:14:45,702
So you can stay here

209
00:14:45,983 --> 00:14:49,241
I have a lot to discuss with him.

210
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,530
Thank you

211
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,046
Can I stay here?

212
00:14:52,071 --> 00:14:52,679
Yes

213
00:14:53,163 --> 00:14:55,686
But Please help me find Mr. Akutagawa

214
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:56,460
OK

215
00:14:56,694 --> 00:14:57,515
Sorry to disturb you

216
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,194
Take care

217
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:00,210
See you

218
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,928
Why does he play with women when he has such a beautiful wife?

219
00:15:08,093 --> 00:15:10,858
Marital relationships are difficult

220
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,249
So don't you get married

221
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,218
I just don't have a marriage partner

222
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:15,515
I will pick you up at 5 o'clock

223
00:15:36,765 --> 00:15:39,272
I've been waiting for you

224
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:41,468
I heard that the distribution of property is over

225
00:15:42,749 --> 00:15:46,038
I received this house and shares totaling 20 million yen.

226
00:15:47,476 --> 00:15:54,304
He is thinking of me and blames himself for the divorce.

227
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,421
He is a very honest and weak man

228
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:02,218
You are too strong compared to him

229
00:16:03,648 --> 00:16:05,882
That's probably the cause of your divorce

230
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:10,148
I think of myself as a weak woman

231
00:16:11,406 --> 00:16:13,820
I can't live without someone's support

232
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:19,163
You are very nicely raised

233
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,968
You are very educated

234
00:16:24,374 --> 00:16:29,632
You acted fine to make him stronger

235
00:16:32,804 --> 00:16:34,538
You were perfect wife

236
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,828
He was weak husband

237
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,531
In the result

238
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:45,687
You just made his inferiority complex harder.

239
00:16:48,859 --> 00:16:51,804
Why didn't you consult with us?

240
00:16:53,445 --> 00:16:56,640
If you talked to us, we wouldn't have to divorce.

241
00:16:57,382 --> 00:16:58,242
Chizu-san

242
00:16:59,546 --> 00:17:03,992
I would gladly consult if you really loved him

243
00:17:05,202 --> 00:17:07,515
I didn't love him from the beginning

244
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:11,343
I just wanted his money

245
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:17,038
I was able to be with him

246
00:17:18,576 --> 00:17:20,357
You are strong

247
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:26,421
On the contrary he loved you.
So he couldn't live with you

248
00:17:28,702 --> 00:17:31,023
You can live with him together even if you don't love him

249
00:17:32,749 --> 00:17:35,077
He loves you so he divorces

250
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:37,867
You and he have completely different personalities

251
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:43,898
I don't want to be the one to arbitrate between you guys.

252
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,312
Are your lawyers doing it right?

253
00:17:49,695 --> 00:17:50,992
Yes. He's doing well

254
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:58,695
What are you going to do after divorcing?

255
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,171
I haven't decided yet

256
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:05,788
I'm living alone now

257
00:18:06,968 --> 00:18:10,874
I need someone who support me

258
00:18:26,406 --> 00:18:29,608
Wife, your meal is ready

259
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:32,195
I see.
Please come

260
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,132
This is Akutagawa's

261
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:55,257
Thank you

262
00:18:55,898 --> 00:18:58,796
We will prepare your bath, so please come in when you are ready.

263
00:18:58,874 --> 00:18:59,507
Thank you

264
00:18:59,999 --> 00:19:02,335
Please make yourself at home

265
00:19:44,546 --> 00:19:46,913
Oh, you are awake

266
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:49,648
I couldn't sleep

267
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:50,882
Why?

268
00:19:52,288 --> 00:19:56,632
I was thinking of you and Akutagawa

269
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:00,601
Nakabe-san

270
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,499
Am I bad woman?

271
00:20:04,648 --> 00:20:05,351
Why?

272
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:10,445
I'm scared of myself

273
00:20:11,968 --> 00:20:15,140
Please help me,Nakabe-san

274
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:17,515
Chizu-san

275
00:20:19,202 --> 00:20:23,373
Time will heal your hearts and minds.

276
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:26,734
You need to wait

277
00:20:28,413 --> 00:20:33,179
There are times in life when you have to be patient.

278
00:20:42,054 --> 00:20:43,132
May I help you?

279
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,171
Mr.Takeda is waiting for Nakabe-san

280
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:49,444
I'll be there soon

281
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:57,772
Welcome

282
00:20:57,797 --> 00:20:58,655
Welcome

283
00:20:58,772 --> 00:20:59,640
Where is Akutagawa?

284
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:00,983
He's in back

285
00:21:01,069 --> 00:21:04,476
It's good timing,Nakabe-san

286
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:06,405
We're in trouble

287
00:21:08,327 --> 00:21:09,788
Welcome

288
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,265
Welcome

289
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,468
Welcome

290
00:21:12,608 --> 00:21:13,593
Akutagawa

291
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:16,851
Hey, Akutagawa!

292
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:22,944
He was terribly drunk from last night.
He fell asleep here.

293
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:26,046
We're in trouble

294
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,124
Can you take him out?

295
00:21:28,149 --> 00:21:29,506
Madam, come here

296
00:21:29,718 --> 00:21:30,921
I'm leave it to you

297
00:21:32,694 --> 00:21:34,405
Hey, Akutagawa!

298
00:21:35,718 --> 00:21:36,757
Hey, Akutagawa!

299
00:21:37,554 --> 00:21:38,765
Who're you?

300
00:21:39,561 --> 00:21:41,757
Oh Nakabe

301
00:21:42,983 --> 00:21:44,640
I thought you were in Kyushu

302
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:47,390
I was bored so I've come back earlier

303
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:50,421
I understand you've been
drinking since last night.

304
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:53,202
No way, I've just started to drink

305
00:21:53,546 --> 00:21:55,499
Give me brandy!

306
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:58,686
Oh, I have an appointment.
What time is it now?

307
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:02,921
I have an appointment with nice woman

308
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,788
At your room

309
00:22:05,382 --> 00:22:07,694
Can you stay at hotel for me?

310
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:10,476
Wait. What her name?

311
00:22:10,616 --> 00:22:15,202
I have no idea.
I won't know until I see her.

312
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,921
You are so drunk that you have gotten the days wrong by a day.

313
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:24,921
Don't say bullshit.
I've made an appointment on 31st May

314
00:22:25,476 --> 00:22:27,077
But Today is 1st of June

315
00:22:28,194 --> 00:22:31,202
She was died

316
00:22:31,569 --> 00:22:32,155
Eh?

317
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,944
She was poisoned.

318
00:22:34,327 --> 00:22:38,343
She was died as soon as She left my room.
So I was suspected by police

319
00:22:38,843 --> 00:22:42,444
Please explain to me why you have appointment with the woman

320
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:44,921
He is Takeda police

321
00:22:45,593 --> 00:22:48,702
I have no idea.
Ask Tamai lawyer

322
00:22:49,147 --> 00:22:50,171
What's wrong with Tamai lawyer?

323
00:22:50,265 --> 00:22:57,655
In short,We ended up divorcing, but relatives blamed
Chizu.

324
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,546
They say all is her fault

325
00:23:01,311 --> 00:23:04,476
So I made a plan

326
00:23:05,757 --> 00:23:09,397
I cheat systematically.
I get my picture taken.

327
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:15,757
I am photographed by a weekly magazine having sex with a woman

328
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:18,913
So they stop blaming her.

329
00:23:19,491 --> 00:23:20,835
Chizu is also hurtled

330
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:27,054
It means, I am so bad man, Chizu is nice wife.
So we can divorce easily

331
00:23:28,772 --> 00:23:31,468
Do you think this is good idea?

332
00:23:32,241 --> 00:23:34,163
Did you ask the plan to Tamai lawyer?

333
00:23:34,327 --> 00:23:39,452
That's right. I asked him to send a woman who can play with me

334
00:23:40,616 --> 00:23:42,498
Then camera man comes

335
00:23:42,616 --> 00:23:44,796
The door was open.
Did you unlock on purpose?

336
00:23:44,976 --> 00:23:47,022
Yes I intended

337
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:49,882
Did you know there was poison in the brandy?

338
00:23:50,022 --> 00:23:51,897
I have no idea at all

339
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:55,874
Please trust me

340
00:24:00,045 --> 00:24:01,967
The key is Tamai lawyer

341
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,483
I want you to see her dead body

342
00:24:05,702 --> 00:24:08,976
Do you know her?
We don't know her identity yet

343
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:11,483
I have no idea

344
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:19,897
Manager.
He's Tamai lawyer

345
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:21,929
I'm Takeda

346
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:24,788
That's a problem

347
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:27,499
I was surprised to read the news

348
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:31,155
Is she the woman whom you sent Nakabe's room?

349
00:24:31,249 --> 00:24:32,960
Yes She is

350
00:24:33,226 --> 00:24:35,226
She's called Michi Oka strip dancer

351
00:24:35,452 --> 00:24:36,866
What do you have something to do with her?

352
00:24:37,132 --> 00:24:41,694
She was a key witness in a case I was working on.

353
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:49,382
Did you ask the witness in another case
to be the woman in Mr. Akutagawa's play?

354
00:24:49,407 --> 00:24:51,671
Yes, She took this work for 100000yen

355
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:56,421
So I wrote an address memo and give it to her

356
00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:00,647
Tokyo apartment 2F room 7.
That's my room

357
00:25:01,061 --> 00:25:02,866
I got suspected because of you

358
00:25:02,952 --> 00:25:08,226
You are Nakabe,right?
I've heard about you from Chizu

359
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:12,467
Did you know there was poison in the brandy?

360
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:13,991
I have no idea

361
00:25:14,335 --> 00:25:16,491
What is your other case?

362
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:20,507
This is the issue of Mr. Tokumaru's estate's auto accident.

363
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:23,163
Please explain to us in detail

364
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,272
It was 15th Nov, half year ago

365
00:25:28,334 --> 00:25:35,076
54 years Old Tokumaru returned with a woman
called Keiko matsumoto who is 25 years old bar hostess

366
00:25:36,366 --> 00:25:37,561
Let's go

367
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,827
Please go together

368
00:25:41,272 --> 00:25:42,491
Thanks

369
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:55,593
Then, half an hour later, a terrible accident
happened.

370
00:25:56,311 --> 00:25:58,280
He may have fallen asleep at the wheel.

371
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:03,226
Michi oka found the car.
She was the first witness

372
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:13,062
Both the driver and Tokumaru died instantly.

373
00:26:13,796 --> 00:26:16,601
Only his wife Keiko was alive at the moment

374
00:26:17,648 --> 00:26:21,491
Michi asked a nearby person to call the police

375
00:26:22,593 --> 00:26:25,358
Keiko died when the ambulance came

376
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:34,015
Michi OKa is the only witness who can prove that Tokumaru-san died before Keiko-san.

377
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:35,007
That's right

378
00:26:35,944 --> 00:26:39,702
Mr. Tokumaru had a formal will

379
00:26:40,921 --> 00:26:45,999
If Tokumaru dies first, 80% of his property will belong to his wife.

380
00:26:46,718 --> 00:26:49,444
The remaining 20% will belong to his niece, Megumi Tokumaru.

381
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:56,132
If Keiko dies first, 80% of heritage will belong to Megumi Tokumaru.

382
00:26:56,788 --> 00:26:59,562
The remaining 20% will be donated to social work

383
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,241
How much is his legacy?

384
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,616
It's about 200 million yen

385
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,546
It's about 200 million yen?

386
00:27:05,187 --> 00:27:08,476
That's a lot of money.
Enough amount to motivate a crime

387
00:27:09,257 --> 00:27:13,640
For now, Tokumaru died first, so the property belongs to Keiko.

388
00:27:14,476 --> 00:27:17,710
However, Keiko also died, so his property belongs to her close relatives.

389
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:20,507
Who is the her close relatives?

390
00:27:21,296 --> 00:27:23,976
Keiko's older brother Hideo Matsumoto.

391
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:28,101
Who asked for this case?

392
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,319
From the Matsuoto

393
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:31,944
I see

394
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:37,452
You proceeded to negotiate with Mr. Mitchie to make his testimony legally valid.

395
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,366
That's right

396
00:27:39,476 --> 00:27:41,921
The other passenger who got in the car with them also died?

397
00:27:42,812 --> 00:27:44,827
He is missing now

398
00:27:45,233 --> 00:27:46,092
He is missing now?

399
00:27:47,569 --> 00:27:52,648
According to Michi, he was thrown out of the car when the accident happened.

400
00:27:53,366 --> 00:27:55,991
He wasn't there when she called and came back to the scene

401
00:27:56,835 --> 00:27:58,265
That's strange

402
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:02,593
You lost one of your important witnesses in this case, right?

403
00:28:02,804 --> 00:28:03,523
That's right

404
00:28:03,726 --> 00:28:07,155
If this case is related to an inheritance

405
00:28:07,507 --> 00:28:12,874
Megumi Tokumaru has a motive to kill Michi

406
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:16,265
A man named Hideo Matsumoto is also related to inheritance.

407
00:28:17,452 --> 00:28:20,179
And you are related too,Tamai

408
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,350
Why do you think so?

409
00:28:22,593 --> 00:28:24,710
You've already collected the testimony you need, right?

410
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:28,554
If you had decided to give some rebate to MICHI

411
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,608
It ’s better to kill her

412
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:31,483
You!

413
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:33,991
Don't say bullshit

414
00:28:35,358 --> 00:28:36,874
Please stop selfish reasoning

415
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:40,405
So you are saying I am innocent.

416
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,554
maybe

417
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,179
Thanks

418
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,452
This is a disaster

419
00:28:46,477 --> 00:28:47,273
disaster?

420
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,116
It is called disaster in English

421
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:08,218
Hello? I'm Nakabe

422
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:11,092
Who are you?

423
00:29:11,118 --> 00:29:14,030
Mind your own business.
You talked about Michi?

424
00:29:14,866 --> 00:29:17,194
Yes I did

425
00:29:17,219 --> 00:29:20,038
Listen.
You should be careful

426
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:26,937
If you talk about strange things, you will be killed.

427
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:31,405
Unfortunately I am lawyer.
I'm used to being threatened.

428
00:29:32,148 --> 00:29:33,015
You should be careful

429
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:36,546
Be careful before it's too late

430
00:29:37,874 --> 00:29:38,585
Wait!

431
00:29:42,421 --> 00:29:43,273
Who was he?

432
00:29:46,312 --> 00:29:47,632
Tokumaru side?

433
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:50,843
Or Matsumoto?

434
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,929
Hello? I'm Nakabe

435
00:29:59,827 --> 00:30:01,155
Oh chizu

436
00:30:02,944 --> 00:30:05,757
I was innocent I'm sorry to worry

437
00:30:05,874 --> 00:30:07,882
That's good to hear

438
00:30:08,429 --> 00:30:11,577
I was very worried about you

439
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:15,062
Have you found the culprit yet?

440
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,835
Eh? Akutagawa and Tamai?

441
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:22,905
Oh no...

442
00:30:23,546 --> 00:30:27,585
They are so stupid

443
00:30:28,437 --> 00:30:33,952
But The killer may have used the madness to confuse the case.

444
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:35,468
That's scary

445
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:38,851
I am also responsible

446
00:30:40,616 --> 00:30:44,186
I'm scared and painful every day

447
00:30:44,694 --> 00:30:46,273
I can't stand anymore

448
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:51,351
Chizu-san

449
00:30:53,413 --> 00:30:56,757
Please rest without thinking tonight

450
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:03,116
Time will heal you

451
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,991
Time will heal you

452
00:31:10,194 --> 00:31:10,999
See you

453
00:31:12,296 --> 00:31:13,327
Good night

454
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,890
There was poison in this brandy

455
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:28,882
Manager

456
00:31:29,468 --> 00:31:30,858
Thanks for your work

457
00:31:31,124 --> 00:31:34,101
He was there when I went near the Michi's apartment

458
00:31:34,538 --> 00:31:37,710
He looks just like the guy who went to your apartment

459
00:31:37,735 --> 00:31:39,218
You killed her!

460
00:31:39,937 --> 00:31:41,077
Sit down

461
00:31:41,304 --> 00:31:42,835
I'm sure he is

462
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,968
I see

463
00:31:44,968 --> 00:31:46,593
Is he michi's man?

464
00:31:46,618 --> 00:31:48,351
He was her gigolo

465
00:31:48,577 --> 00:31:53,780
He tried to get some money from her handbag while she was taking a bath and found a piece of paper with your address on it.

466
00:31:54,554 --> 00:31:56,210
Oh that memo

467
00:31:57,444 --> 00:32:00,780
He misunderstood and went to your house

468
00:32:01,538 --> 00:32:03,780
He may have been jealous and poisoned Brandy

469
00:32:03,805 --> 00:32:04,944
I don't know!

470
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,866
I loved her

471
00:32:08,225 --> 00:32:09,468
It's impossible I killed her

472
00:32:09,493 --> 00:32:10,523
How did you get that diamond ring?

473
00:32:10,788 --> 00:32:12,390
She gave it to me

474
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:13,976
Don't tell a lie!
You stole it!

475
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:18,741
Let him rest a little.
It ’s better not to talk too much in front of a lawyer.

476
00:32:30,858 --> 00:32:32,507
Was there anything in her room?

477
00:32:32,757 --> 00:32:36,280
500,000 yen was deposited in her bankbook last November 20th

478
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:37,640
November 20th?

479
00:32:37,851 --> 00:32:41,249
She started working at a nightclub called Manhattan from that day

480
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:43,733
It's a lot of money for a contract

481
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,608
Manager

482
00:32:49,343 --> 00:32:49,976
I found it

483
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:50,562
Good

484
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:56,226
This ring is said to have been sent to his wife by Mr. Tokumaru, who died in a car accident.

485
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,898
Oh this is Tokumaru's

486
00:32:59,515 --> 00:33:00,655
Yoshikawa has this

487
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:05,624
It ’s a 3 carat diamond.

488
00:33:06,077 --> 00:33:08,249
Why did Michi have this?

489
00:33:08,616 --> 00:33:13,335
This is Keiko's belongings, so it belongs to her brother, Hideo Matsumoto.

490
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:16,593
Michi had deal something?

491
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:18,921
She might have wanted the ring instead of giving a favorable testimony

492
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:22,507
Or she may have stolen this ring at the scene of the accident

493
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:28,140
In any case,Michi has something to do with the issue of inheritance of Tokumaru's heritage.

494
00:33:29,069 --> 00:33:31,015
You are in danger if you are involved in this case

495
00:33:31,905 --> 00:33:34,624
I had a threatening phone call last night

496
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,108
He thought michi said something to me

497
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:43,053
I would like to see the face of the person I made the threatening call to.

498
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:56,007
Excuse me

499
00:33:58,265 --> 00:34:02,210
I'm sorry to interrupt you but is there Megumi Tokumaru?

500
00:34:04,233 --> 00:34:05,233
It's me

501
00:34:12,155 --> 00:34:15,827
I quickly realized that you were Michi's lawyer

502
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,515
I saw it in the newspaper

503
00:34:17,601 --> 00:34:18,898
I see

504
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:21,765
So You knew her

505
00:34:21,819 --> 00:34:24,718
Yes I met her for the first time on the morning of the day she died

506
00:34:25,451 --> 00:34:25,951
Where?

507
00:34:26,077 --> 00:34:27,280
At my apartment

508
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:34,491
I asked her to visit me.
She said my uncle died first but wanted to ask if it was true

509
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:35,671
What she said?

510
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:40,358
She said she would be willing to change her testimony if I gave her half of my inheritance.

511
00:34:42,593 --> 00:34:45,468
Who do you talk to about this issue?

512
00:34:45,749 --> 00:34:50,343
My uncle has died.
I have no relatives

513
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,257
How about Hideo Matsumoto?

514
00:34:52,554 --> 00:34:55,398
I only met him a couple of times.
I hate him

515
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:58,515
Can you introduce me to a good lawyer?

516
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:07,842
I need a good, inexpensive, honest and kind lawyer

517
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:11,460
There is no such lawyer

518
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:14,030
Lawyers are all realistic

519
00:35:14,382 --> 00:35:17,265
We want a high paid job

520
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:21,421
Finally I want to ask you another one

521
00:35:22,554 --> 00:35:25,249
Did you give her any presents?

522
00:35:25,648 --> 00:35:28,179
For example, a ring or brandy

523
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:32,366
Is it a poisoned Brandy?
You think I killed her?

524
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:37,390
Because she is the only witness against you.

525
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:40,405
There was enough ...

526
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:41,663
motive for the murder?

527
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:47,226
It's true that I don't hesitate to kill people for money

528
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:51,515
Because my uncle is gone and no one is supporting me.

529
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:55,671
I understand.
Thank you

530
00:36:00,382 --> 00:36:03,718
If you need the lawyer I'll introduce you

531
00:36:24,726 --> 00:36:25,476
Hello?

532
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:31,460
Hello?

533
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:33,015
Who?

534
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:36,733
What?

535
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:38,702
I am a person from insurance company

536
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:39,655
insurance company?

537
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:42,905
Ikebo!

538
00:36:42,983 --> 00:36:47,507
An insurance company person is here.
It seems that Grandpa Kumai had life insurance.

539
00:36:48,022 --> 00:36:49,694
If all goes well, money will come in again.

540
00:36:55,476 --> 00:36:56,686
Which company?

541
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,413
I'm from Showa insurance company

542
00:36:59,272 --> 00:37:00,210
How much is life insurance?

543
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,257
5 million

544
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:03,866
Are you police,right?

545
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:07,483
I won't be fooled.
I contacted various insurance companies

546
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,780
The old man didn't have any insurance with any insurance company.

547
00:37:11,311 --> 00:37:13,022
Don't pretend to be the police

548
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,607
So let me ask you plainly.

549
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:18,616
Why did you give Michi a diamond ring?

550
00:37:18,641 --> 00:37:20,366
I have been asked by police about it many times

551
00:37:20,391 --> 00:37:21,663
I need to ask you again

552
00:37:22,936 --> 00:37:24,733
How much did Michi ask you for a rebate?

553
00:37:25,054 --> 00:37:27,804
A lawyer said 20%

554
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:31,999
In addition, I was asked for a diamond ring that my sister was wearing at the time of the accident.

555
00:37:33,671 --> 00:37:35,796
So did he write the conditions?

556
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:39,835
But when that document is ready, Mr. Michie is in the way.

557
00:37:41,132 --> 00:37:42,554
You have a motive for murder

558
00:37:42,579 --> 00:37:45,311
No way.
I don't do that

559
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,827
I won't do anything dangerous like murdering

560
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:50,429
Michi was talking to Tokumaru's niece

561
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:53,780
So This would make anyone want to kill her.

562
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,397
Really?
She talks to Tokumaru's niece?

563
00:37:58,788 --> 00:38:00,210
I'll hit her if she's alive

564
00:38:02,007 --> 00:38:04,694
OK that's enough

565
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:07,436
Unfortunately I'm not police

566
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:10,851
I'm a lawyer named Nakabe

567
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:12,382
See you

568
00:38:25,905 --> 00:38:26,827
Who's he?

569
00:38:58,851 --> 00:39:03,358
Welcome back.
I told the superintendent of the apartment building that I am your sister and he unlocked the door.

570
00:39:05,421 --> 00:39:06,890
This is for you

571
00:39:07,851 --> 00:39:10,663
The newspaper said you like whiskey

572
00:39:10,897 --> 00:39:14,147
You look different

573
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:18,069
It doesn't contain poison, right?

574
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:21,749
Because I am very careful about unauthorized entry of women.

575
00:39:21,774 --> 00:39:22,718
Don't worry

576
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,366
I'm here to ask you something

577
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,929
Will you be my lawyer?

578
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:33,561
I'm not the romantic lawyer you want

579
00:39:34,304 --> 00:39:35,046
It's ok

580
00:39:36,132 --> 00:39:40,022
I will give you the money I was going to give to Michi-san.

581
00:39:42,101 --> 00:39:45,155
In short,Is it 50% of the heritage you receive?

582
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,585
And if that wasn't enough, I can give you all of it.

583
00:39:49,632 --> 00:39:50,671
What do you mean?

584
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:54,663
I want to marry you

585
00:39:56,147 --> 00:39:58,835
Because I am alone

586
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,171
I need someone who support me

587
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:04,890
I was crashed on you when I met you first time

588
00:40:08,358 --> 00:40:09,358
Look

589
00:40:10,624 --> 00:40:11,874
Do you think I am cute?

590
00:40:13,304 --> 00:40:16,233
I would be more beautiful if I spent more money.

591
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:20,194
The more money a woman spends, the more beautiful she becomes

592
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:25,188
I think it's good but I need to think about it

593
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:27,804
I will wait until you feel like it

594
00:40:28,655 --> 00:40:31,421
But you can be my lawyer, right?

595
00:40:32,351 --> 00:40:34,186
Ok I will

596
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,671
I'm glad

597
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,327
This is my address

598
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,030
Thanks

599
00:40:40,311 --> 00:40:41,249
You know what

600
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,811
I have another request for you

601
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:47,007
What?

602
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:51,476
Will you kiss me one time?

603
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,272
As a sign of the contract

604
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:56,100
I don't feel safe.

605
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:56,983
Eh?

606
00:40:59,101 --> 00:41:00,913
So please

607
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:13,781
Ready?

608
00:41:36,421 --> 00:41:38,108
Love is wonderful

609
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:43,226
So please

610
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:27,421
Don't move

611
00:42:27,804 --> 00:42:28,601
Hold up!

612
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:33,609
Who are you?

613
00:42:34,007 --> 00:42:34,796
It's me

614
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:38,484
Do you remember my face?

615
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:42,164
Sakae's Matsukichi?

616
00:42:42,453 --> 00:42:43,429
That's right

617
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:48,898
You took a fraud case 3 years ago and collected bullshit
testimony.

618
00:42:49,562 --> 00:42:51,273
I was in jail.

619
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,265
Who asked you this?

620
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:54,867
No one asked me

621
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:59,272
I'm just here to get back at you.

622
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:00,164
Don't tell a lie!

623
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:04,210
I'm sure someone asked you.
He gave you the pistol and drugs

624
00:43:04,765 --> 00:43:05,570
What?

625
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,742
I can see it in your eyes and your wrists.

626
00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:10,765
You have the wrong person to hold a grudge
against.

627
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:14,171
You got out of jail, but who gave you the drugs?

628
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:14,984
Shut up!

629
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:20,249
It's not your business

630
00:43:26,468 --> 00:43:27,546
 Say it!

631
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:28,648
Who asked you?

632
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,218
You will go back to jail for illegal possession of firearms and breaking and entering, if you don't tell me.

633
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,468
Forgive me.
I'll say it

634
00:43:35,718 --> 00:43:38,022
I was asked by Goda.
The boss of Goda company

635
00:43:38,233 --> 00:43:39,257
Goda company?

636
00:43:39,983 --> 00:43:42,007
Why he targets me?

637
00:43:42,218 --> 00:43:46,022
I have no idea.
Please forgive me

638
00:43:46,187 --> 00:43:48,647
Don't tell him otherwise I'll be killed

639
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:50,968
Damn it

640
00:43:51,124 --> 00:43:54,108
Drugs are no longer effective.

641
00:43:54,952 --> 00:43:56,679
I need to take a drug!

642
00:44:08,983 --> 00:44:09,788
Hello?

643
00:44:11,874 --> 00:44:12,788
Oh Chizu-san

644
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:17,929
I have not found out it yet

645
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,788
The issue of Mr. Tokumaru's legacy certainly has something to do with
it.

646
00:44:22,631 --> 00:44:24,710
I met with both sides of the inheritance rights holders
today.

647
00:44:24,858 --> 00:44:27,374
Don't involved in that so much

648
00:44:28,038 --> 00:44:29,624
Someone might try to kill you

649
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:32,272
Eh? Someone just tried to attack you by pistol?

650
00:44:32,593 --> 00:44:34,147
Are you safe now?

651
00:44:36,585 --> 00:44:37,812
That's scary

652
00:44:38,921 --> 00:44:40,546
Please Nakabe-san

653
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,647
Stay out of this case.

654
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:47,351
Because I'm anxious every day and it's hard for
me.

655
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:50,257
I'll be mad

656
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:54,022
So Let's have dinner tomorrow

657
00:44:54,991 --> 00:44:57,476
Listen to music and relax!

658
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,866
Don't worry about me

659
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:03,952
Good night

660
00:45:13,265 --> 00:45:14,921
The boss of Goda company

661
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:18,585
Goda?
Did you find out?

662
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:21,155
It's easy for me

663
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:22,263
What kind of guy is he?

664
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:23,608
He's modern gang

665
00:45:23,882 --> 00:45:26,585
He was arrested for extortion several years ago.

666
00:45:26,913 --> 00:45:28,749
He was sentenced to 10 years in prison.

667
00:45:29,202 --> 00:45:36,585
He got sick in prison and was paroled on the grounds of illness.

668
00:45:37,624 --> 00:45:43,491
He owns Mitchi's strip bar, but I don't think he had anything to do with the case.

669
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:46,413
Or you got any news?

670
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,499
Don't think too much.
Thank you!

671
00:45:50,202 --> 00:45:51,405
I got good information

672
00:45:53,022 --> 00:45:55,335
He owns Mitchi's strip bar

673
00:45:56,194 --> 00:45:58,851
The Goda sent Sakai to kill me

674
00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:01,702
There's something

675
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,647
Welcome back

676
00:46:04,093 --> 00:46:05,476
I went there

677
00:46:05,851 --> 00:46:06,663
How was it?

678
00:46:06,749 --> 00:46:09,124
I checked passenger manifests at the airline.

679
00:46:09,249 --> 00:46:11,421
There are only 10 passengers

680
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:14,296
Exclude Tokumaru and Keiko, there were 8 passengers

681
00:46:14,577 --> 00:46:15,655
They are couple

682
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:16,515
They are Parent and child

683
00:46:16,851 --> 00:46:19,866
Other 4 passengers, he and he are Catholic
priests

684
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:20,944
Catholic nun

685
00:46:21,171 --> 00:46:22,335
Ichiro Sanada

686
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,851
The person is left

687
00:46:24,202 --> 00:46:26,585
I could find out his address

688
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:27,671
Fake name?

689
00:46:27,733 --> 00:46:28,671
Maybe

690
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:30,155
I see

691
00:46:31,905 --> 00:46:35,038
OK, I'll go to Manhatten bar tonight

692
00:46:35,108 --> 00:46:36,444
Are you Ok to go there alone?

693
00:46:36,538 --> 00:46:38,624
We can go together

694
00:46:38,897 --> 00:46:40,929
No way, I have a date with a woman

695
00:46:41,437 --> 00:46:42,897
I have a date with a woman

696
00:46:49,257 --> 00:46:50,117
Cheers

697
00:46:53,054 --> 00:46:54,953
For what?

698
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,203
For your happiness

699
00:46:57,812 --> 00:47:00,179
Do I have happiness?

700
00:47:00,539 --> 00:47:02,117
People all think so

701
00:47:02,937 --> 00:47:07,171
Either people in a hurry every day and people unhappy, or people have a dream and people happy.

702
00:47:08,281 --> 00:47:09,843
I am the latter.

703
00:47:10,515 --> 00:47:11,882
Will you dance with me?

704
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:38,695
I'm waiting for you

705
00:47:45,062 --> 00:47:46,023
Whiskey

706
00:47:48,757 --> 00:47:51,265
Excuse me because my friend came

707
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,796
Thanks for last night

708
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,616
Where can I meet with Goda?

709
00:48:06,641 --> 00:48:08,351
I don't know

710
00:48:08,376 --> 00:48:10,640
If you lie, you'll be in jail again

711
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:11,937
Tell me

712
00:48:18,468 --> 00:48:20,375
Do you want to see him so much?

713
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:23,444
I'll ask him.
Wait here

714
00:48:27,492 --> 00:48:28,882
Who's the guy?

715
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:32,109
He's Goda's subordinate

716
00:48:36,132 --> 00:48:37,429
Welcome

717
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:48,765
Oh long time no see

718
00:48:49,164 --> 00:48:51,320
I asked her out

719
00:48:51,492 --> 00:48:53,944
I thought she should relieve stress

720
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:55,404
That's kind of you

721
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:56,928
Let's drink together

722
00:48:56,953 --> 00:48:58,529
Bring brandy

723
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:02,201
She is the best celebrity in Japan

724
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:03,240
Clam down

725
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,451
You look good couple

726
00:49:05,529 --> 00:49:09,865
The upcoming incident has convinced all my relatives to divorce.

727
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:14,021
You are free to have a date

728
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:17,771
But Please be careful about beautiful women

729
00:49:18,943 --> 00:49:22,076
I should have been more careful

730
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:24,349
I am the loser of life

731
00:49:26,896 --> 00:49:28,372
Let's dance with someone

732
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:31,896
I'll dance

733
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:36,685
Let's dance

734
00:49:42,467 --> 00:49:43,240
Chizu-san

735
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:44,771
I'll go home

736
00:49:46,396 --> 00:49:48,037
Our boss is waiting for you

737
00:49:48,451 --> 00:49:49,967
Can you call me later?

738
00:49:56,506 --> 00:49:57,505
Where's he?

739
00:50:02,498 --> 00:50:07,583
I suggest you back off this case.

740
00:50:07,803 --> 00:50:08,756
You wrote this?

741
00:50:08,781 --> 00:50:09,459
No

742
00:50:14,295 --> 00:50:15,740
I've brought him

743
00:50:19,459 --> 00:50:20,709
Come in

744
00:50:21,178 --> 00:50:23,396
First of all, I'm sick

745
00:50:23,553 --> 00:50:27,810
The country worried me and gave me home care

746
00:50:27,889 --> 00:50:30,725
I see.
Here's your house?

747
00:50:31,014 --> 00:50:34,951
Yes I'm living here

748
00:50:35,404 --> 00:50:38,123
This room is registered properly

749
00:50:39,014 --> 00:50:40,748
So What can I do for you?

750
00:50:41,139 --> 00:50:45,584
Your voice looks exactly like the threatening phone I received earlier

751
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:46,865
I have no idea

752
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:51,076
So what’s this?

753
00:50:52,162 --> 00:50:54,350
You drugged Mr. Sakai and tried to kill me.

754
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:58,803
And you wrote this

755
00:51:00,631 --> 00:51:02,764
I have no idea

756
00:51:03,881 --> 00:51:05,842
It's bad for your health if you make a loud voice

757
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:10,350
When did Mitchi-san start dancing at that bar?

758
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:13,404
You are not the police, so why should I talk to you?

759
00:51:13,693 --> 00:51:15,912
I don't force to answer

760
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:19,756
I know the date, 20th Nov

761
00:51:20,592 --> 00:51:22,717
Was she your lover?

762
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:27,396
No way,
She just wanted my money

763
00:51:28,029 --> 00:51:31,818
You didn't kill her, right?

764
00:51:32,107 --> 00:51:32,779
Of course

765
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:35,115
Why do you get involved in this case?

766
00:51:35,178 --> 00:51:41,225
This case involves a heritage issue.
Mr. Tokumaru's daughter has asked me to represent her.

767
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:46,521
Listen, I'm sure you have something to do with this case

768
00:51:47,107 --> 00:51:50,045
Your subordinate met Hideo Matsumoto yesterday

769
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,100
What?

770
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:55,435
If he wants to get his commission, he has to get a little more than his daughter's share.

771
00:51:56,045 --> 00:51:57,975
It was necessary to overturn her testimony

772
00:51:58,021 --> 00:52:02,748
Shut up!
I'm sick so leave me alone

773
00:52:03,803 --> 00:52:06,458
How much you need to get back this issue?

774
00:52:08,537 --> 00:52:13,576
If you try to kill me I will tell the police about this pistol

775
00:52:14,178 --> 00:52:15,850
Take care of your health

776
00:52:19,912 --> 00:52:21,256
Damn it

777
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,154
That dude

778
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:27,904
Need cab?

779
00:52:28,123 --> 00:52:29,107
I don't need

780
00:52:31,286 --> 00:52:32,692
Welcome

781
00:52:46,568 --> 00:52:47,857
Wait!

782
00:52:55,006 --> 00:52:56,287
Are you OK?

783
00:53:14,006 --> 00:53:14,771
Stop

784
00:53:14,951 --> 00:53:16,178
My room is there

785
00:53:18,842 --> 00:53:21,912
Oh Nakabe-san
There is big problem again

786
00:53:22,295 --> 00:53:22,959
Again?

787
00:53:23,350 --> 00:53:24,857
Around here?

788
00:53:25,146 --> 00:53:26,951
It's a close distance

789
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:29,240
Can I get fingerprints?

790
00:53:29,404 --> 00:53:30,842
I can't find it

791
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:32,912
Oh Nakabe

792
00:53:33,303 --> 00:53:34,107
What's wrong?

793
00:53:44,872 --> 00:53:46,216
Akutagawa!

794
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:49,396
I thought you were killed

795
00:53:50,725 --> 00:53:51,709
Look

796
00:53:55,873 --> 00:53:58,842
The criminal was looking at his shadow

797
00:53:59,896 --> 00:54:01,178
He tried to kill me?

798
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:03,583
maybe.
2 shots in close distance

799
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:05,701
It seems that he wrapped the pistol in a blanket and shot it

800
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:10,334
The sound of the shower was so noisy that the neighbor didn't understand it.

801
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:18,404
Damn it. who killed him

802
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:20,357
Do you have an alibi?

803
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:21,490
Eh?

804
00:54:23,967 --> 00:54:26,232
You are also one of the suspects

805
00:54:26,678 --> 00:54:28,162
I hear you are dating with the wife

806
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,428
No way

807
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,264
Why should I kill my best friend since I was a kid

808
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,475
The police will prove my alibi

809
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:45,232
I was at the police station last night after being attacked by a pistol in the town

810
00:54:45,748 --> 00:54:48,350
Oh, who tried to kill you?

811
00:55:11,342 --> 00:55:12,467
I'm sorry

812
00:55:14,608 --> 00:55:15,826
As you know

813
00:55:16,608 --> 00:55:17,975
He died on my behalf

814
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,647
Don't say that

815
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,451
He seemed dead before he died

816
00:55:24,483 --> 00:55:26,889
I made him do that

817
00:55:27,045 --> 00:55:29,819
I'd rather be responsible for it.

818
00:55:31,639 --> 00:55:35,506
I was purposely running away from your problems.

819
00:55:37,389 --> 00:55:40,905
I'm thinking of going on a trip for a while

820
00:55:41,553 --> 00:55:43,139
I'm thinking of going to a quiet place

821
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:47,030
That's good for you

822
00:55:47,561 --> 00:55:48,561
Enjoy yourself

823
00:55:49,795 --> 00:55:50,920
Will you go with me?

824
00:55:54,381 --> 00:55:56,194
I'd love to have you.

825
00:56:01,522 --> 00:56:03,280
Oh you are here

826
00:56:04,655 --> 00:56:07,592
It's been a disaster.

827
00:56:09,217 --> 00:56:13,045
But your divorce problem has been resolved naturally.

828
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:14,772
You are mean

829
00:56:14,797 --> 00:56:16,186
Watch your mouth.

830
00:56:17,037 --> 00:56:18,069
Sorry

831
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:20,209
By the way

832
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:26,849
I understand that you have retained Tokumaru Megumi at all. to represent you in an estate matter.

833
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:28,623
Yes that's true

834
00:56:28,662 --> 00:56:29,537
I see

835
00:56:30,514 --> 00:56:31,201
Wife

836
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:37,819
It is better to solve these problems so each other democratically!

837
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:40,319
A lawyer is a collaborator.

838
00:56:40,881 --> 00:56:44,678
Why was my collaborator attacked so many times?

839
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:47,819
What does this have to do with me?

840
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:51,256
At least you and your client are suspicious

841
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:53,522
I'll sue you if you're rude

842
00:56:53,670 --> 00:56:54,897
Stop it

843
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:59,608
I'm leaving now

844
00:57:00,373 --> 00:57:02,389
Let's talk about your family register problem later

845
00:57:08,342 --> 00:57:10,920
I was sorry to bother you

846
00:57:12,522 --> 00:57:12,983
See you

847
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:19,655
Promise me what I said

848
00:57:20,733 --> 00:57:23,420
Yes, if I'm free

849
00:57:32,795 --> 00:57:34,123
Good morning

850
00:57:34,148 --> 00:57:35,264
Good morning

851
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:36,959
We have a visitor.

852
00:57:37,108 --> 00:57:37,733
Who?

853
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,662
He doesn't say his name

854
00:57:43,428 --> 00:57:43,983
Oh

855
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:49,670
Isn't it supposed that you can't go out except at the hospital at home?

856
00:57:49,740 --> 00:57:51,811
I sneaked out

857
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,983
You have something wrong

858
00:57:55,576 --> 00:58:00,092
Actually I was caught in a trap

859
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,584
Will you be my attorney?

860
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:08,100
What is your mansion's requirement?

861
00:58:08,498 --> 00:58:12,045
I want no part of this issue.

862
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:14,819
I have enough money

863
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:18,615
What makes you so afraid?

864
00:58:20,483 --> 00:58:21,475
I can't say

865
00:58:22,272 --> 00:58:27,170
I can overcome this crisis if you ignore the disadvantages to me

866
00:58:30,428 --> 00:58:31,311
I reject

867
00:58:32,444 --> 00:58:34,061
I'm not such a lawyer

868
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,990
What?

869
00:58:35,194 --> 00:58:36,842
Please get out

870
00:58:39,545 --> 00:58:42,138
You are so nasty

871
00:58:42,365 --> 00:58:43,584
What happened to the bandage?

872
00:58:45,428 --> 00:58:50,295
I just got a little injured.
Don't crush my face

873
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:55,475
Don't tell anyone I visited you

874
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,209
I know

875
00:58:56,615 --> 00:58:59,811
You're on parole, so it's a problem.

876
00:59:00,928 --> 00:59:01,998
Damn it

877
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,209
Oh Goda?

878
00:59:06,787 --> 00:59:08,170
We'll find out now

879
00:59:08,357 --> 00:59:10,107
Goda got injured on his wrist

880
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:16,030
I don't know where Sakai is

881
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:18,694
Yoshikawa lives in Michi's apartment

882
00:59:19,412 --> 00:59:22,428
Gouda's subordinates Kochi is missing

883
00:59:23,592 --> 00:59:26,006
He had a great fight with Goda.

884
00:59:26,209 --> 00:59:28,201
What is the cause?

885
00:59:29,115 --> 00:59:33,389
Find out the cause of his injury anyway.
He may have been injured with a pistol

886
00:59:35,709 --> 00:59:37,334
Kochi had a great fight with Goda.

887
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:41,045
Money or woman

888
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:45,256
Where are you going to?

889
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,569
I'll see Yoshikawa at Michi's apartment

890
00:59:49,155 --> 00:59:50,147
Here it is

891
00:59:53,287 --> 00:59:53,975
Thanks

892
01:00:39,405 --> 01:00:40,170
Don't move

893
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:45,530
No worry

894
01:00:46,436 --> 01:00:49,077
He's just knocked out from the beating I gave
him.

895
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:50,577
Why you've come here?

896
01:00:52,585 --> 01:00:56,866
That's good you are here.
I'm here to ask about you to Yoshikawa

897
01:00:57,538 --> 01:00:58,218
Sit down

898
01:01:00,202 --> 01:01:01,671
What do you want to know about me?

899
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,546
About Michi

900
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:07,264
I recently had a fight with him.

901
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,405
He was just her jigoro

902
01:01:11,132 --> 01:01:14,163
Michi is mine so her property is mine

903
01:01:14,835 --> 01:01:17,335
But All her things were sold.

904
01:01:17,491 --> 01:01:19,139
Are you looking for her diamond ring?

905
01:01:19,772 --> 01:01:22,335
So you are here to get it from Yoshikawa,right?

906
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,811
That's right.
But he said police took the ring

907
01:01:27,381 --> 01:01:28,139
Damn it

908
01:01:28,164 --> 01:01:29,366
Did you fight with Goda?

909
01:01:30,593 --> 01:01:35,030
About Matsumoto's share of property or Micchi?

910
01:01:38,522 --> 01:01:41,662
Goda neither want money nor her body

911
01:01:42,093 --> 01:01:43,421
He was treated by her

912
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:44,593
Why?

913
01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:49,147
I can't say.
I need to go

914
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:55,007
Listen,
Don't tell anyone that I came here

915
01:01:55,593 --> 01:01:57,499
It is easy to kill you

916
01:02:00,764 --> 01:02:01,960
Are you left handed?

917
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:07,038
This pistol is the only legacy my parents left
me.

918
01:02:09,155 --> 01:02:11,428
Get him some water.
He'll be awake

919
01:02:17,053 --> 01:02:18,327
Get well

920
01:02:26,608 --> 01:02:27,811
Welcome back

921
01:02:27,836 --> 01:02:29,202
Oh you

922
01:02:29,227 --> 01:02:31,897
The superintendent thinks I am totally your
sister.

923
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,460
You had a hard time

924
01:02:35,858 --> 01:02:39,076
Two people were killed in this room. Aren't you
afraid?

925
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:41,483
I don't care.
I'll take care of you

926
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:45,514
What's this?

927
01:02:46,248 --> 01:02:50,342
Shinjuku messenger deliverer it

928
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,624
I'm heading to Hakone

929
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:02,358
I'll stay at Tonosawa inn

930
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,944
I'll be waiting for you

931
01:03:06,374 --> 01:03:08,701
Can I guess?
From a wife?

932
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:09,952
No

933
01:03:10,257 --> 01:03:12,061
Your face is telling it

934
01:03:12,483 --> 01:03:16,280
I'm good at reading people's minds.

935
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:19,116
Are you going?

936
01:03:20,803 --> 01:03:22,030
I won't go

937
01:03:24,163 --> 01:03:26,327
I'm good cooking,ain't  I?

938
01:03:29,335 --> 01:03:30,788
It's better to not to go

939
01:03:38,827 --> 01:03:40,171
Excuse me

940
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:43,772
We have your visitor

941
01:03:44,382 --> 01:03:45,311
Come in

942
01:03:55,569 --> 01:03:57,452
Thanks for coming

943
01:03:58,491 --> 01:03:59,022
Yes

944
01:04:04,366 --> 01:04:05,639
I'm glad

945
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:14,733
I've been waiting for this

946
01:04:16,257 --> 01:04:17,608
Chizu-san

947
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:46,069
It's the first time I see your happy face

948
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,124
Really

949
01:04:48,405 --> 01:04:50,905
I need to take care of Akutagawa's property after
I back  to Tokyo

950
01:04:53,241 --> 01:04:55,983
Will you work on our problem?

951
01:04:56,796 --> 01:04:58,694
It's too troublesome

952
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:03,382
The tax office is nagging me and my relatives are
complaining.

953
01:05:03,725 --> 01:05:06,897
I don't want to ask to Tamai, so Please

954
01:05:24,084 --> 01:05:26,858
Can you stay one more night?

955
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:30,217
I need to take care of the case

956
01:05:31,030 --> 01:05:33,491
We'll come back when the case is solved.

957
01:05:33,531 --> 01:05:38,615
I thought you accepted my request to stay out of that case.

958
01:05:39,264 --> 01:05:44,116
I'm trying to work my way to the end.

959
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:51,920
I can't forgive a person who killed Akutagawa

960
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:54,288
Really

961
01:06:06,459 --> 01:06:10,530
I will avenge him.

962
01:06:17,850 --> 01:06:19,772
You are really strong

963
01:06:21,592 --> 01:06:23,834
I feel very scary

964
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:26,678
That's so me

965
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,045
I'll catch 5 pm's train

966
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:32,780
You really go back?

967
01:06:33,647 --> 01:06:34,475
Yes

968
01:06:45,998 --> 01:06:46,616
Hi

969
01:06:47,764 --> 01:06:48,733
Hey!

970
01:06:48,873 --> 01:06:49,952
You are still alive

971
01:06:50,154 --> 01:06:50,678
Hi

972
01:06:51,475 --> 01:06:54,561
Everyone worry you were missing

973
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:56,084
I just got some rest

974
01:06:56,881 --> 01:06:58,725
By the way,Have you found the cause of GODA's hand injury?

975
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:03,459
I checked and it was just a bruise.

976
01:07:06,725 --> 01:07:09,459
Doctors say he has a bad heart.

977
01:07:10,077 --> 01:07:13,295
Doctors say the next time he goes back to prison, he won't make it out
alive.

978
01:07:14,397 --> 01:07:17,287
By the way, The Kochi is left handed?

979
01:07:17,373 --> 01:07:18,459
I have no idea.
Why?

980
01:07:18,491 --> 01:07:21,772
He was at Michi's apartment when I visited there

981
01:07:22,077 --> 01:07:23,217
He used his left hand

982
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:24,998
He's right handed

983
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:27,827
He used to be a boxer.
His right strait punch was popular

984
01:07:29,592 --> 01:07:30,530
Something is strange

985
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:34,053
He got his right hand injured so he used his
left hand

986
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:35,944
I got it!

987
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:39,834
Hello

988
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,256
Matsumoto-san

989
01:07:56,842 --> 01:07:57,702
Hideo!

990
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:02,576
Hideo!

991
01:08:05,944 --> 01:08:06,881
Oh you

992
01:08:07,178 --> 01:08:09,717
If they find out you and I know each other, we're in big trouble.

993
01:08:09,742 --> 01:08:11,280
I didn't want to come here

994
01:08:11,748 --> 01:08:14,139
Kochi is trying to betray me

995
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,927
We don't need the girl

996
01:08:17,342 --> 01:08:18,436
Go upstairs

997
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:20,820
Have a drink

998
01:08:20,937 --> 01:08:22,187
I can't drink

999
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:27,609
Kochi is threatening you, right?

1000
01:08:27,634 --> 01:08:31,007
He said he would announce your relationship with his dead sister

1001
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,898
He is mother fucker

1002
01:08:35,710 --> 01:08:38,789
Don't tell anyone about Keiko and me

1003
01:08:38,814 --> 01:08:40,289
I know

1004
01:08:41,616 --> 01:08:45,936
Tell me your condition if you want to share the legacy

1005
01:08:45,961 --> 01:08:50,289
Shut up!
I don't want Tokumaru's property

1006
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,703
Do you know where is Kochi?

1007
01:08:54,728 --> 01:08:55,382
No

1008
01:08:55,530 --> 01:09:00,491
Tell him I give him money but Get off this case.

1009
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:01,906
OK?

1010
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:10,117
Is he the former husband of Keiko?

1011
01:09:10,156 --> 01:09:12,124
Yes, he was rich boss before

1012
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,765
Why he does not want money?

1013
01:09:13,882 --> 01:09:17,851
I have no idea.
He used to be very money hungry.

1014
01:09:28,734 --> 01:09:30,538
I found out where Sakai is

1015
01:09:30,563 --> 01:09:31,140
Really?

1016
01:09:31,203 --> 01:09:31,976
He's in Kiba

1017
01:09:33,539 --> 01:09:34,460
Hi I'm Takeda

1018
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:36,827
Are you Takeda?
I'm Nakabe

1019
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:44,023
Goda visited Matsumoto's shop
He was the lover of Tokumaru who died.

1020
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:49,101
Kochi seems to have threatened Matsumoto for that.

1021
01:09:50,335 --> 01:09:53,046
But Goda said he doesn't want money

1022
01:09:53,773 --> 01:09:55,921
He is a blackmail professional.
But Why?

1023
01:09:56,007 --> 01:09:58,375
He hates being involved in the case

1024
01:09:59,507 --> 01:10:00,757
I doubt it

1025
01:10:01,843 --> 01:10:03,812
I found out that  Sakai is in kiba

1026
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:06,867
I'll go there.
Where are you?

1027
01:10:08,812 --> 01:10:10,687
Ok let's meet there

1028
01:10:26,078 --> 01:10:26,773
That room

1029
01:10:27,703 --> 01:10:30,531
The contractor of the room seems to be a drug patient

1030
01:10:31,304 --> 01:10:32,523
He's Matsukichi for sure

1031
01:10:34,687 --> 01:10:35,625
help me

1032
01:10:38,085 --> 01:10:39,117
Wait

1033
01:10:40,335 --> 01:10:41,242
Shit!

1034
01:10:43,351 --> 01:10:44,445
Matsukichi!

1035
01:10:45,171 --> 01:10:46,625
Who attacked you?

1036
01:10:48,382 --> 01:10:49,351
Kochi

1037
01:10:51,882 --> 01:10:56,906
He shot you

1038
01:11:00,828 --> 01:11:01,695
Matsukichi!

1039
01:11:04,007 --> 01:11:05,101
He’s dead

1040
01:11:05,656 --> 01:11:06,914
He was beaten and hit his head

1041
01:11:07,656 --> 01:11:08,953
Kochi did it

1042
01:11:09,281 --> 01:11:10,632
He run away

1043
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:12,585
The criminal is Kochi.
Catch him

1044
01:11:16,703 --> 01:11:19,195
Welcome back.
We have a visitor for you

1045
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:21,867
Hi

1046
01:11:23,265 --> 01:11:24,289
Welcome back.

1047
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:25,921
I just came back

1048
01:11:25,946 --> 01:11:27,156
You should have stayed more

1049
01:11:27,757 --> 01:11:30,156
I missed you

1050
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,015
How did the case go?

1051
01:11:34,968 --> 01:11:36,828
Another murder has just happened

1052
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:40,062
Matsuyoshi Sakai was killed

1053
01:11:40,429 --> 01:11:41,578
We know the culprit

1054
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:43,671
That's scary

1055
01:11:43,906 --> 01:11:47,523
I think he will be arrested soon and the case will be resolved

1056
01:11:48,812 --> 01:11:50,671
I have a weird phone call for you.

1057
01:11:50,796 --> 01:11:51,476
From Kochi

1058
01:11:51,632 --> 01:11:52,866
Kochi.
connect me

1059
01:11:55,296 --> 01:11:56,515
Hi, I'm Nakabe

1060
01:11:57,539 --> 01:12:00,187
You can't get away with it, so turn yourself in.

1061
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:01,217
Wait

1062
01:12:03,023 --> 01:12:04,742
I didn't mean to kill him

1063
01:12:05,140 --> 01:12:07,953
I only hit him once

1064
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:11,773
I have a criminal record, so it's a bit of a problem if it's a murder

1065
01:12:11,914 --> 01:12:15,390
If you admit that was a coincidence, I will turn myself in.

1066
01:12:15,523 --> 01:12:17,156
Why you attacked him?

1067
01:12:17,429 --> 01:12:22,070
He saw me tending to an injury to my right hand the night I shot you.

1068
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:24,617
He threatened me because he wanted drug money

1069
01:12:25,179 --> 01:12:26,882
That's why I got so mad.

1070
01:12:27,601 --> 01:12:28,656
Why you shot me?

1071
01:12:29,015 --> 01:12:32,421
Actually, I have a weak spot in Matsumoto about GODA.

1072
01:12:33,976 --> 01:12:36,890
That's a big deal, so I threatened Matsumoto.

1073
01:12:37,531 --> 01:12:38,921
He took me up on my offer.

1074
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:42,484
But you are a lawyer who denies Matsumoto's story

1075
01:12:43,203 --> 01:12:45,851
So I threatened you

1076
01:12:46,062 --> 01:12:47,062
I get it

1077
01:12:47,890 --> 01:12:51,640
If you kill Michi and Akutagawa, you are definitely the death penalty.

1078
01:12:51,765 --> 01:12:54,960
I definitely didn't kill them

1079
01:12:56,367 --> 01:12:58,171
Trust me

1080
01:13:00,164 --> 01:13:03,000
I didn't mean to kill Sakai

1081
01:13:03,185 --> 01:13:04,693
Trust me

1082
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,263
Where are you now?

1083
01:13:06,833 --> 01:13:07,396
What?

1084
01:13:08,771 --> 01:13:12,052
I'll go with you. so wait there

1085
01:13:13,278 --> 01:13:15,982
Matsuki's murderer turns himself in.
I'll go there

1086
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:19,349
He killed Akutagawa too?

1087
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:22,755
He said he didn't but The case will be resolved soon

1088
01:13:26,318 --> 01:13:27,341
Ouch!

1089
01:13:27,366 --> 01:13:28,247
This is a wound shot with a pistol

1090
01:13:28,272 --> 01:13:29,208
It hurts

1091
01:13:29,318 --> 01:13:31,443
What is Goda's secret?

1092
01:13:32,083 --> 01:13:35,849
He is the former husband of KEIKO, who is related to Tokumaru

1093
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,357
Did they formally get married?

1094
01:13:38,654 --> 01:13:39,919
Yes. they were registered

1095
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:43,505
In short,Keiko broke up with Goda and got married

1096
01:13:43,615 --> 01:13:46,951
Did they formally file a marriage registration?

1097
01:13:47,693 --> 01:13:49,638
They submitted the document

1098
01:13:51,037 --> 01:13:52,513
But It was fake document

1099
01:13:52,919 --> 01:13:54,193
What? Fake?

1100
01:13:54,802 --> 01:13:55,482
Why?

1101
01:13:56,834 --> 01:13:58,888
Goda was in a jail for long time

1102
01:14:00,146 --> 01:14:03,130
Keiko was with Tokumaru while Goda was in a jail

1103
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:06,826
Goda refused divorce

1104
01:14:07,576 --> 01:14:09,388
so Keiko asked Matsumoto

1105
01:14:09,724 --> 01:14:11,373
He did something

1106
01:14:12,287 --> 01:14:15,419
Keiko entered into marriage with Tokumaru-san before divorcing Tokumaru

1107
01:14:17,123 --> 01:14:18,099
This is a duplicate marriage.

1108
01:14:18,193 --> 01:14:21,115
No.
Marriage between Tokumaru and Keiko is invalid

1109
01:14:22,505 --> 01:14:23,263
In short

1110
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,943
Matsumoto does not have the right to inherit heritage

1111
01:14:31,013 --> 01:14:33,146
That's why you threatened Matsumoto.

1112
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:35,076
Yes

1113
01:14:36,427 --> 01:14:40,263
Why did Goda get so angry to know that

1114
01:14:41,162 --> 01:14:42,685
Because you were stealing the share?

1115
01:14:43,974 --> 01:14:47,677
He's so angry for another reason

1116
01:14:47,841 --> 01:14:49,201
Do you have any idea?

1117
01:14:50,638 --> 01:14:53,091
He wasn't in the club for a few days after the car accident

1118
01:14:54,154 --> 01:14:56,677
I think he went to Kansai in search of Keiko

1119
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:58,755
He was on parole

1120
01:14:59,458 --> 01:15:01,896
He makes a fool of the police

1121
01:15:02,279 --> 01:15:04,591
Why did he take the risk and go to Kansai?

1122
01:15:06,044 --> 01:15:08,459
There must be some reason

1123
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:12,341
Let's check Goda

1124
01:15:14,779 --> 01:15:16,849
The case will be resolved soon

1125
01:15:20,677 --> 01:15:21,623
What?

1126
01:15:22,162 --> 01:15:24,036
Police is here

1127
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:27,623
Police?

1128
01:15:33,419 --> 01:15:34,568
What's wrong?

1129
01:15:35,685 --> 01:15:36,662
I'm Higuchi

1130
01:15:36,716 --> 01:15:38,716
I'm sick.
Can you come tomorrow?

1131
01:15:38,826 --> 01:15:41,732
We are here for urgent business

1132
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:44,575
You have a marital relationship with Keiko Matsumoto in the family register.

1133
01:15:44,701 --> 01:15:47,334
So what?
I have nothing to do with the case

1134
01:15:47,849 --> 01:15:50,013
Why did you pay Michi 500,000 yen?

1135
01:15:50,396 --> 01:15:51,841
For a contract

1136
01:15:52,044 --> 01:15:53,459
It was too much for contract

1137
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:56,607
You went to Kansai in search of Keiko Matsumoto.

1138
01:15:56,663 --> 01:16:00,022
Don't say bullshit.
I'm sick

1139
01:16:00,459 --> 01:16:02,458
We looked up a hotel in Kansai

1140
01:16:02,888 --> 01:16:05,060
You went to stop their marriage.

1141
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:08,427
Why do you think so?

1142
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:10,755
I finally get it

1143
01:16:11,591 --> 01:16:14,677
You can't leave the hospital or home on your own

1144
01:16:15,662 --> 01:16:18,380
You boarded the plane under the alias Ichiro Sanada.

1145
01:16:19,341 --> 01:16:22,076
The airplane stewardess is the witness

1146
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:25,998
There were only ten passengers, and the girls said they could easily recognize him by his face.

1147
01:16:35,209 --> 01:16:37,201
I loved Keiko

1148
01:16:38,537 --> 01:16:40,287
I know I can't leave here without permission

1149
01:16:41,287 --> 01:16:42,794
And I'm sick

1150
01:16:44,248 --> 01:16:45,904
But I had to go

1151
01:16:47,271 --> 01:16:48,513
Did you meet her?

1152
01:16:48,748 --> 01:16:49,646
Yes

1153
01:16:50,021 --> 01:16:54,451
She told me to wait for a while because she will take as much money as possible from Mr. Tokumaru.

1154
01:16:54,476 --> 01:16:58,138
She introduced Tokumaru that I was her uncle

1155
01:16:58,607 --> 01:17:00,865
So you came back with the three of you

1156
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:05,294
Yes. I'm so sick

1157
01:17:05,568 --> 01:17:07,560
Next time I go to jail, I'll be dead

1158
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:13,607
I wanted to spend the last part of my life in this club I built

1159
01:17:15,302 --> 01:17:18,271
I desperately escaped from the scene of the traffic accident

1160
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:20,802
Your right hand was injured at the time of the car accident

1161
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,224
Yes

1162
01:17:23,005 --> 01:17:27,959
After that Michi came to my club for an interview

1163
01:17:28,857 --> 01:17:31,623
She remembered my face

1164
01:17:32,177 --> 01:17:35,966
She threatened me and demanded an exorbitant contract fee.

1165
01:17:36,826 --> 01:17:37,599
That's all

1166
01:17:37,716 --> 01:17:39,474
Why did you threaten me on the phone?

1167
01:17:39,794 --> 01:17:42,981
Because I thought MICHI told you that I went to Kansai

1168
01:17:44,810 --> 01:17:45,873
That's all

1169
01:17:46,451 --> 01:17:48,857
I did not threaten you with me during this time.

1170
01:17:49,412 --> 01:17:51,537
Now we have a pretty good idea of what the whole case is about.

1171
01:17:52,513 --> 01:17:57,693
If you keep Keiko's duplicate marriage a secret, Hideo Matsumoto will inherit the property.

1172
01:17:59,474 --> 01:18:00,826
You worked for him

1173
01:18:02,005 --> 01:18:07,443
MICHI now knows about it and threatened you about their duplicate marriage.

1174
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:11,076
You gave Michi a poisoned brandy

1175
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:13,474
I didn't do that

1176
01:18:13,826 --> 01:18:18,138
Megumi Tokumaru asked Nakabe Lawyer for the case.

1177
01:18:18,865 --> 01:18:22,310
You accidentally shot and killed Mr. Akutagawa

1178
01:18:22,335 --> 01:18:25,294
I don't know Akutagawa

1179
01:18:25,966 --> 01:18:27,513
Don't say bullshit

1180
01:18:31,005 --> 01:18:34,396
You guys are bullying me

1181
01:18:35,873 --> 01:18:38,490
I don't know at all

1182
01:18:39,060 --> 01:18:41,154
I don't want to go to jail

1183
01:18:48,443 --> 01:18:54,123
You are not working on Ms. Matsumoto's estate issue knowing about Keiko's duplicate marriage?

1184
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:56,888
No way.
I didn't know

1185
01:18:56,913 --> 01:19:00,771
If you did, you would have to go to jail too

1186
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:05,630
Here are two copies of the family register for Keiko

1187
01:19:06,357 --> 01:19:09,841
Marriage between Tokumaru and Keiko Matsumoto is invalid

1188
01:19:10,209 --> 01:19:13,638
You acknowledge that Megumi Tokumaru will be an inheritance of heritage?

1189
01:19:15,099 --> 01:19:17,435
Yes you are right

1190
01:19:19,068 --> 01:19:21,740
I had a terrible time.

1191
01:19:23,943 --> 01:19:24,935
Hello

1192
01:19:25,443 --> 01:19:26,162
Oh

1193
01:19:26,950 --> 01:19:29,161
Let's have a drink together

1194
01:19:29,419 --> 01:19:30,912
She's Megumi Tokumaru

1195
01:19:31,279 --> 01:19:33,771
Tamai worked for nothing so He laments.

1196
01:19:33,796 --> 01:19:37,287
That's too bad.
I can pay him

1197
01:19:38,209 --> 01:19:41,654
That's kind to him

1198
01:19:41,974 --> 01:19:43,857
So Please toast for me

1199
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:47,576
This is Johnnie walker

1200
01:19:48,052 --> 01:19:48,880
I brought this from the apartment

1201
01:19:48,905 --> 01:19:49,560
I see

1202
01:19:50,021 --> 01:19:51,106
Are there cups?

1203
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:52,334
Please

1204
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:55,255
Did GODA confess to the crime?

1205
01:19:55,334 --> 01:19:57,748
He has been denying

1206
01:19:59,209 --> 01:20:03,091
Stewardess admits he is with Tokumaru

1207
01:20:04,537 --> 01:20:09,170
There's one more thing I don't agree with you
on.

1208
01:20:09,195 --> 01:20:12,506
The police will have everything sorted out

1209
01:20:13,255 --> 01:20:18,294
I should have never put on the act like your wife told me
to.

1210
01:20:18,881 --> 01:20:20,318
I feel responsible.

1211
01:20:21,568 --> 01:20:24,529
put on the act? about Michi?

1212
01:20:24,826 --> 01:20:28,811
Akutagawa got drunk and told his wife

1213
01:20:29,186 --> 01:20:31,201
His wife tried to stop me

1214
01:20:31,631 --> 01:20:34,334
But Akutagawa really wanted me to act

1215
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:37,225
Here it is

1216
01:20:41,725 --> 01:20:43,912
Cheers for you

1217
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:49,936
I'll answer

1218
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:53,068
Hello? Nakabe?

1219
01:20:53,397 --> 01:20:55,365
He's here

1220
01:20:56,013 --> 01:20:57,442
From a woman

1221
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:00,568
Hello

1222
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:02,436
Chizu-san

1223
01:21:02,865 --> 01:21:05,248
I just saw a newspaper

1224
01:21:05,725 --> 01:21:08,639
You've solved the case, congratulations.

1225
01:21:08,975 --> 01:21:10,131
I'm glad

1226
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:13,850
I still have my doubts.

1227
01:21:14,693 --> 01:21:16,654
I think Goda tell everything later

1228
01:21:17,139 --> 01:21:18,475
I want to see you

1229
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:19,560
Come to my apartment

1230
01:21:20,795 --> 01:21:22,506
OK then I will visit you

1231
01:21:24,717 --> 01:21:25,647
Hello?

1232
01:21:27,420 --> 01:21:28,607
What's wrong?

1233
01:21:28,826 --> 01:21:29,795
Hello?

1234
01:21:36,326 --> 01:21:37,818
There was a poison in this whiskey

1235
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:41,342
Hello?

1236
01:21:41,537 --> 01:21:42,920
Tamai-san

1237
01:21:42,951 --> 01:21:44,232
Tamai-san

1238
01:21:44,889 --> 01:21:46,240
Hello?

1239
01:21:46,772 --> 01:21:48,506
Tamai was killed.
I'll get back to you

1240
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:50,685
Tamai-san

1241
01:21:51,388 --> 01:21:54,130
Here is West Ginza building.
Please come right now

1242
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:56,373
He's died

1243
01:21:56,522 --> 01:21:57,154
OK

1244
01:21:58,147 --> 01:21:59,100
What happened?

1245
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:02,693
Suddenly in agony he collapsed.

1246
01:22:03,092 --> 01:22:04,295
Who called police?

1247
01:22:12,287 --> 01:22:14,646
When did you bring the whiskey to Nakabe's room?

1248
01:22:15,357 --> 01:22:16,287
3,4days ago

1249
01:22:16,787 --> 01:22:17,662
Where did you buy it?

1250
01:22:17,857 --> 01:22:18,982
At Sanyo department

1251
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,342
You've brought it this morning

1252
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:23,505
Yes, I thought we'll have a drink together

1253
01:22:23,530 --> 01:22:25,186
Was the whiskey cork open?

1254
01:22:25,357 --> 01:22:29,294
The amount of whiskey was the same, but the whiskey cork was
open.

1255
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:31,490
Someone put poison in it at his apartment

1256
01:22:31,515 --> 01:22:32,936
If you didn't

1257
01:22:33,412 --> 01:22:35,272
Do you suspect me?

1258
01:22:35,482 --> 01:22:38,943
You pretend to be his sister, and go to his room
often

1259
01:22:39,365 --> 01:22:41,217
No one can go to his room besides you

1260
01:22:43,373 --> 01:22:44,131
There is

1261
01:22:44,928 --> 01:22:46,053
Who?

1262
01:22:51,561 --> 01:22:55,334
The person who give the key to Akutagawa

1263
01:22:58,397 --> 01:22:59,326
Takeda-san

1264
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:06,537
We have paid too much attention to the Tokumaru couple's inheritance problems.

1265
01:23:07,568 --> 01:23:10,162
The two incidents were related by coincidence.

1266
01:23:11,397 --> 01:23:17,100
The killer used the other case to hide his own case

1267
01:23:17,404 --> 01:23:19,412
Goda didn't kill Michi and Akutagawa?

1268
01:23:21,936 --> 01:23:22,842
This is so scary

1269
01:23:24,522 --> 01:23:25,912
I can't believe this

1270
01:23:27,764 --> 01:23:28,936
I never thought about that

1271
01:23:32,686 --> 01:23:34,170
Where are you going?

1272
01:23:35,670 --> 01:23:39,576
Please leave me alone...

1273
01:23:51,045 --> 01:23:54,209
Nakabe has come

1274
01:24:23,357 --> 01:24:24,772
Welcome

1275
01:24:27,803 --> 01:24:28,865
Welcome

1276
01:24:30,686 --> 01:24:31,967
What happened to Tamai-san

1277
01:24:32,811 --> 01:24:36,779
He was dead soon

1278
01:24:38,981 --> 01:24:43,067
Someone put poison in the whiskey at my room

1279
01:24:43,787 --> 01:24:45,600
Someone tried to kill me

1280
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:47,162
Oh

1281
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:50,623
I'm glad you are safe

1282
01:24:50,648 --> 01:24:51,959
It was close

1283
01:24:52,810 --> 01:24:58,263
I was died if you didn't call me

1284
01:24:58,818 --> 01:25:00,303
That's scary

1285
01:25:02,209 --> 01:25:06,045
You saved my life.

1286
01:25:09,928 --> 01:25:10,756
Chizu-san

1287
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,014
Be honest

1288
01:25:14,912 --> 01:25:15,326
Eh?

1289
01:25:16,662 --> 01:25:17,279
For what?

1290
01:25:18,568 --> 01:25:19,576
Be honest

1291
01:25:20,498 --> 01:25:22,881
I have no idea

1292
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:25,061
What are you talking about?

1293
01:25:28,748 --> 01:25:30,811
Can you return the key?

1294
01:25:32,264 --> 01:25:35,514
The key that Akutagawa had

1295
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,217
You used the key and entered my room to put
poison in the whiskey

1296
01:25:39,623 --> 01:25:41,607
I didn't

1297
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:45,927
I take care of the key but I didn't do it

1298
01:25:47,514 --> 01:25:50,217
Michi was killed by poison

1299
01:25:51,084 --> 01:25:52,756
Akutagawa was killed by mistaking

1300
01:25:53,506 --> 01:25:55,084
We had this idea

1301
01:25:57,747 --> 01:26:05,701
By the way, Tamai told me before he died that you knew that Michi went to my apartment for the act

1302
01:26:07,459 --> 01:26:12,302
I thought those two murders were opposite.

1303
01:26:13,193 --> 01:26:16,185
In short,Michi was killed by mistaking

1304
01:26:17,115 --> 01:26:19,872
Akutagawa was killed on purpose

1305
01:26:21,498 --> 01:26:25,068
Tamai was killed and I tried to find out how the poison comes

1306
01:26:26,045 --> 01:26:29,552
I'm starting to think this reasoning of mine is correct.

1307
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:35,451
I was so scared that my legs trembled for the first time in my life

1308
01:26:36,904 --> 01:26:38,553
That's interesting

1309
01:26:39,506 --> 01:26:42,193
What does this have to do with me?

1310
01:26:44,748 --> 01:26:49,076
It wasn't the brandy she brought

1311
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:55,311
You poisoned his favorite brandy to kill Akutagawa

1312
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:58,153
You put it in my room in advance

1313
01:26:59,068 --> 01:27:01,123
You thought he would drink the brandy whenever he came to the room

1314
01:27:02,568 --> 01:27:06,889
The key to my room remained open from the morning

1315
01:27:07,553 --> 01:27:10,193
Do you think I did it?

1316
01:27:11,475 --> 01:27:12,146
Yes

1317
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:15,271
Why I have to kiss him?

1318
01:27:15,693 --> 01:27:18,029
He admitted the divorce and gave me some money

1319
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:20,834
You really didn't want to divorce

1320
01:27:21,756 --> 01:27:24,412
The stock certificates you received have lost half their value in the recent crash.

1321
01:27:25,396 --> 01:27:30,412
You plotted to get all of his property.

1322
01:27:30,568 --> 01:27:33,654
In short. If you kill him before you divorce

1323
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:34,881
Stop it!

1324
01:27:34,906 --> 01:27:36,678
Don't say that

1325
01:27:36,703 --> 01:27:38,693
You have done this horrible thing

1326
01:27:39,795 --> 01:27:43,146
You pretended to aim at me and shot Akutagawa through the door.

1327
01:27:43,787 --> 01:27:45,756
You pretended that you accidentally shot Akutagawa with a pistol

1328
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:51,498
I didn't do it for money

1329
01:27:59,623 --> 01:28:00,396
But

1330
01:28:01,787 --> 01:28:02,951
You were clever

1331
01:28:05,053 --> 01:28:08,857
You know that Mitchi will be an important reference for the Tokumaru case

1332
01:28:10,779 --> 01:28:12,365
I tried to divert their attention there

1333
01:28:14,771 --> 01:28:18,271
You wrote a threatening note at a nightclub

1334
01:28:20,162 --> 01:28:21,006
And finally

1335
01:28:22,639 --> 01:28:26,521
You were so afraid of me that you poisoned the whiskey.

1336
01:28:28,217 --> 01:28:29,951
You know everything

1337
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:34,662
But there are some differences

1338
01:28:35,498 --> 01:28:36,576
It ’s a woman ’s feeling.

1339
01:28:37,967 --> 01:28:38,990
Will you listen to ?

1340
01:28:42,248 --> 01:28:42,686
Sure

1341
01:28:44,803 --> 01:28:47,248
You think of me as a strong woman

1342
01:28:48,365 --> 01:28:50,037
I'm really a weak woman

1343
01:28:52,217 --> 01:28:55,021
I was raised by the power of money

1344
01:28:56,318 --> 01:28:59,646
I can't live without money

1345
01:29:01,607 --> 01:29:06,029
The stock market crashed and I was very inconsolable.

1346
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,686
I wanted more money

1347
01:29:12,186 --> 01:29:15,756
But Michi was dead

1348
01:29:16,154 --> 01:29:17,748
I regret

1349
01:29:18,561 --> 01:29:22,381
Indeed, I used the inheritance issue to try to somehow fool them.

1350
01:29:25,303 --> 01:29:30,217
But I went home after being bullied by Akutagawa at the club

1351
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:33,771
I thought I was very pathetic

1352
01:29:35,748 --> 01:29:38,732
So I wanted to hear your voice

1353
01:29:39,068 --> 01:29:42,811
But I heard Akutagawa's voice and heard something terrible again

1354
01:29:45,154 --> 01:29:51,779
I thought I could get money with you if I killed Akutagawa

1355
01:29:54,084 --> 01:29:56,014
I'm really bad woman

1356
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,357
I killed him

1357
01:30:04,217 --> 01:30:05,857
I suddenly felt scared

1358
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:09,881
I'm scared of you

1359
01:30:11,342 --> 01:30:14,154
I thought so when I heard from you in Hakone

1360
01:30:17,068 --> 01:30:22,803
I went back to Tokyo and poisoned whiskey in your office

1361
01:30:24,670 --> 01:30:28,271
Then I was very upset

1362
01:30:29,092 --> 01:30:32,342
I just called because I didn't want you to drink the whiskey

1363
01:30:35,842 --> 01:30:40,037
Can you understand my feelings?

1364
01:30:42,975 --> 01:30:47,521
Are you going to call the police on me?

1365
01:30:48,373 --> 01:30:49,451
Tell me

1366
01:30:52,014 --> 01:30:54,521
I thought this would happen someday

1367
01:30:55,428 --> 01:30:56,662
I also have a pill

1368
01:30:58,404 --> 01:31:03,521
Wish I could have spent even one pleasant day with you.

1369
01:31:06,092 --> 01:31:07,248
Please

1370
01:31:07,982 --> 01:31:09,475
Please sleep with me

1371
01:31:11,842 --> 01:31:12,982
This is the last request

1372
01:31:14,162 --> 01:31:15,756
Please sleep with me

1373
01:31:17,818 --> 01:31:21,459
Can't you because I'm a bad girl?

1374
01:31:23,076 --> 01:31:24,428
Nakabe-san

1375
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:27,318
This is the last farewell.
Hug me

1376
01:31:28,670 --> 01:31:30,084
I need to say good bye

1377
01:31:31,678 --> 01:31:32,725
Please

1378
01:31:41,146 --> 01:31:42,623
You are a strong person

1379
01:31:44,936 --> 01:31:46,404
You are a strong person

1380
01:31:53,248 --> 01:31:54,279
good bye

1381
01:31:56,170 --> 01:31:57,326
Be happy

1382
01:32:34,045 --> 01:32:34,865
Chizu-san

1383
01:32:35,904 --> 01:32:36,717
Chizu-san

1384
01:32:45,584 --> 01:32:46,303
Chizu-san

1385
01:33:00,771 --> 01:33:01,436
Chizu-san

1386
01:33:02,943 --> 01:33:03,779
Nakabe-san

1387
01:33:05,404 --> 01:33:06,967
I am

1388
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:10,771
Bad woman

1389
01:33:13,279 --> 01:33:20,326
Bury bad women like me deep in the earth.

1390
01:33:23,686 --> 01:33:29,459
People's blame and your hatred too

1391
01:33:30,748 --> 01:33:35,467
Bury them in the ground, too.

1392
01:33:38,451 --> 01:33:39,912
Bury them

1393
01:33:43,701 --> 01:33:44,701
Chizu-san

1394
01:33:49,888 --> 01:33:54,114
You were weak woman

1395
01:33:56,315 --> 01:34:01,831
You were weak woman

1396
01:34:16,472 --> 01:34:25,580
THE END

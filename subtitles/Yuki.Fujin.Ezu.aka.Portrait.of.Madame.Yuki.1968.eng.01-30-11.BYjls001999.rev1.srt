2
00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:27,693
Snow in Shinano.

3
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,969
Just like the name,

4
00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:37,818
She looks like she was beautifully born out of the snow.

5
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:52,426
<i>Yuki Fujin Ezu / Portrait of Madame Yuki / A Picture of Madame Yuki
(Produced in 1968 / Released in 1975)</i>

6
00:01:13,194 --> 00:01:19,447
Madam Yuki was born in this village.

7
00:02:06,343 --> 00:02:08,822
1949

8
00:02:15,173 --> 00:02:18,121
That was last year,

9
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:23,399
Yuki's father,Elders of the House of Lords

10
00:02:24,673 --> 00:02:28,728
and he was our village boss long ago

11
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:37,408
It was on the day that Shakushi Shinano Chozaemon passed away

12
00:02:41,173 --> 00:02:48,492
Hamako is living in a villa by the lake

13
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:52,639
Thanks to my help, on the day of the funeral,

14
00:02:53,662 --> 00:03:00,614
I went to help out at Gohontei at Shinanoike.

15
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:09,763
This was the first of Hamako's apprenticeship.

16
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,470
Excuse me.

17
00:03:50,076 --> 00:03:51,262
it's Hama.

18
00:03:55,294 --> 00:03:56,100
Oh you.

19
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,286
Thank you in advance.

20
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,150
Where should I put those flowers?

21
00:04:02,814 --> 00:04:03,787
Just leave them there.

22
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:04,749
I get it.

23
00:04:25,434 --> 00:04:26,854
How's okin?

24
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,762
She told me to say hello to you.

25
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:38,285
The lake is still frozen?

26
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,338
But the mountains are pure white

27
00:04:42,978 --> 00:04:43,771
mountains?

28
00:04:47,286 --> 00:04:49,291
I heard you didn't have your mom.

29
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:55,577
She died last year.
She was good friends with Okin

30
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:59,226
My father died in the Philippines because of war.

31
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:06,054
so I'm glad I had a good person come here.

32
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,630
Sorry, I can't do anything.

33
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,724
Excuse me.

34
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,499
I'm Tsuya.

35
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,117
Please come in.

36
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,239
Ohin.

37
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:24,063
She was so nice person.

38
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:32,679
It's dark.

39
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:40,220
She was looking so healthy when I met her the other day

40
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,124
What are you doing? Get out.

41
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:44,411
Yes.

42
00:05:49,693 --> 00:05:51,367
I’m sorry.

43
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,285
How lonely you are.

44
00:05:56,643 --> 00:05:57,583
Thanks.

45
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:00,204
Gotoshi has not arrived yet?

46
00:06:03,216 --> 00:06:05,103
I telegramed.

47
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:08,459
I know it's far Kyoto from Tokyo.

48
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:11,047
But, it was three days ago.

49
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:15,875
Who is going to take care of the funeral

50
00:06:17,622 --> 00:06:19,462
I just met Osumi there

51
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:21,466
Is Yuki here?

52
00:06:22,088 --> 00:06:22,602
She's here.

53
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:42,488
The wake guests are here.

54
00:06:43,522 --> 00:06:44,435
I see.

55
00:06:45,979 --> 00:06:49,104
By the way, about funeral

56
00:06:51,768 --> 00:06:53,968
I'm sure you must be tired.

57
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,500
If Yuki's mother were alive,

58
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:00,579
She was nice person

59
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,747
I wanted to take orders from her.

60
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:10,880
But she passed away 20 years ago.

61
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:18,607
From the age of 16, I have been taking care of you

62
00:07:19,146 --> 00:07:20,396
I have mentioned them in order of age

63
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,226
Time is not an issue.

64
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,426
Just by being by your side, you can't do your job as a woman

65
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
You are just a maid.

66
00:07:33,065 --> 00:07:34,336
What's the hell?

67
00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:35,475
I’m sorry.

68
00:07:36,576 --> 00:07:44,364
Who on earth is the person who did something strange with other guys?

69
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,606
Did I do that?

70
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,018
Don't pretend you don't know.

71
00:07:48,571 --> 00:07:50,484
I know everything

72
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,088
What?

73
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:52,202
What?

74
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,266
Please excuse me for playing quietly

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,494
I’m sorry.

76
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,458
Let's go over there.

77
00:08:01,652 --> 00:08:02,699
It's fine

78
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,726
I'd be humiliated in front of the Buddha.
I can't keep quiet.

79
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,638
We all have the same idea.

80
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,710
The dead lord left a difficult problem.

81
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,958
The daimyo's blood is tainted

82
00:08:33,616 --> 00:08:35,155
It was like a zoo.

83
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,839
Thank you for taking care of us.

84
00:08:41,864 --> 00:08:43,406
Not at all

85
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,649
I'm sorry for him.

86
00:08:50,502 --> 00:08:52,589
I'm Yamazaki from antique store.

87
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:03,933
Please give me Okra's treasure

88
00:09:04,557 --> 00:09:06,317
I'll give you all the high-end stuff.

89
00:09:21,785 --> 00:09:23,212
Yogoretachi...

90
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,059
Chudanna is leaving.

91
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,686
Chudanna is leaving.

92
00:10:02,141 --> 00:10:02,850
Chichiya!

93
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:07,026
Welcome back

94
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,648
You...

95
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:10,944
everyone is here.

96
00:10:11,098 --> 00:10:11,978
Who are you?

97
00:10:12,371 --> 00:10:13,831
I'm Yamazaki from antique store.

98
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,903
You're Matsutomo.

99
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm sorry for him.

100
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:20,753
I'll give you old antique.

101
00:10:22,138 --> 00:10:23,615
Please make a big sale.

102
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,097
Thank you.

103
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,491
Welcome back.

104
00:10:36,612 --> 00:10:37,452
Who's her?

105
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,160
She the new maid from Shinshu.

106
00:10:41,214 --> 00:10:42,514
my name is Hana.

107
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,089
How old was your father?

108
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,440
He was 73.

109
00:10:52,406 --> 00:10:54,406
He lived long.

110
00:11:23,513 --> 00:11:26,513
Did you know that Osumi was dating  with Tsuchiya?

111
00:11:27,294 --> 00:11:28,820
No.

112
00:11:32,423 --> 00:11:34,263
You're ignorance

113
00:11:37,548 --> 00:11:39,241
Beside this house,

114
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,024
mansion in Yokohama

115
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:44,817
And Some in Asakusa.

116
00:11:45,697 --> 00:11:47,024
All was taken by Tsuchiya.

117
00:11:50,765 --> 00:11:55,235
After I got the telegram, I started researching banking.

118
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,186
Property taxes and other things left us penniless

119
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:03,799
This mansion has also been seized, so nothing of the Shinano family's assets will be left

120
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,937
Our father is also a bit absent-minded, +he's an old-fashioned lord

121
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,729
He was like a bucket of water.

122
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,432
Don't talk badly about him.
Tonight is the wake.

123
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,819
You think it's really my fault

124
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,922
So I'm a paper with a dowry

125
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:32,096
Hey.

126
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:41,094
I am not taken care of.

127
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:46,679
What's the hell?

128
00:12:51,614 --> 00:12:53,615
No money is the same as no head

129
00:12:54,466 --> 00:12:56,556
I'm not gonna do anything. I'm gonna die

130
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,726
The person named Kikunaka is here.

131
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:04,601
The cheap writer?

132
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:10,785
Hi.

133
00:13:11,465 --> 00:13:12,398
Sorry I'm late.

134
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,950
Hey, Shinano family is no good either.

135
00:13:16,635 --> 00:13:17,308
What do you think?

136
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,810
Why don't you write a novel about us?

137
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:24,355
Excuse me.

138
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,466
They found our relationship.

139
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,915
It's all over for us, the Shinano family too.

140
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:45,736
 It feels like a dream

141
00:13:46,549 --> 00:13:50,127
Lords are victims of war, too.

142
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:55,441
You got fat?

143
00:13:56,449 --> 00:13:59,449
MacArthur came.
We had no family or civilians

144
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,076
Christ's Fall and the Fall of the World

145
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:12,915
Excuse me

146
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,668
I received the news.
Thanks.

147
00:14:23,925 --> 00:14:24,605
Not at all.

148
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:32,174
Apparently the lord has passed away

149
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:39,111
Who will clean up Mr. Goto's mess from now on?

150
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,361
He said making a lotion or building tourist hotel.

151
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:49,436
And then he falls for some worthless woman again

152
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:56,629
These days, he's been spending a lot of time with that
girl in Kyoto and he hardly ever come back to Tokyo

153
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:12,203
Well, shall I worship?

154
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,956
I'm so tired

155
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,300
Look, that novelist teacher is a pretty good guy

156
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,207
It seems that Mrs. Yuki is also interested in him.

157
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:49,141
But he has a wife and kid.

158
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:50,395
It's time to go.

159
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:54,367
Yes, I forgot to bring the paper.

160
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,974
I'll go now

161
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,187
, Hama-chan

162
00:17:02,169 --> 00:17:07,505
He's little strange, so be careful.

163
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,684
At times like that, at times like that,

164
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,965
you put force into your abdomen under your navel.

165
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,339
you say it so well.

166
00:17:30,274 --> 00:17:31,254
Excuse me.

167
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:42,963
I've brought some water.

168
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,055
Please come in.

169
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:52,861
I'll leave it here

170
00:17:53,101 --> 00:17:53,868
Bring it here.

171
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:01,852
Bring it here.

172
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:11,828
Hey.

173
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,513
Hey, Take care of her clothes.

174
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,625
Fold them.

175
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:26,875
Fold them.

176
00:18:28,084 --> 00:18:28,750
Yes.

177
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,050
Mrs. Yuki...

178
00:20:27,532 --> 00:20:29,899
35000!

179
00:20:30,825 --> 00:20:32,805
36000!

180
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:36,402
38000! anyone wanna bid?

181
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,582
ok 38000yen.

182
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,726
Next is the 86th Makie Children's Dance

183
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:46,750
50000!50000!50000!

184
00:20:47,774 --> 00:20:50,348
60000! 70000!

185
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:52,907
75000!

186
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,882
75000! anyone wanna bid?

187
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:13,609
He turned the Shinano family's villa into an inn business.

188
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:24,476
We find that hard to believe.

189
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:29,523
Hotel Shinano...

190
00:21:40,306 --> 00:21:42,292
Hello?
This is Hotel Shinano.

191
00:21:43,438 --> 00:21:45,870
Oh master..This is Kin.

192
00:21:48,234 --> 00:21:51,917
Will you arrive tonight?
Ok I get it.

193
00:21:53,322 --> 00:21:54,589
Any guest has come?

194
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:56,369
Master will arrive.

195
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,276
He was calling from Kashiwara station.

196
00:22:00,411 --> 00:22:01,638
He'll come here by car.

197
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:05,637
We are not busy.
Not many guest comes.

198
00:22:05,694 --> 00:22:07,427
Get ready for bath.

199
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,546
Kikunaga sensei want meal at 6 o'clock.

200
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:10,386
Where's wife?

201
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,400
She's with sensei.

202
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:12,826
Again?

203
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,030
Her husband will come.

204
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:16,176
Really?

205
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:17,607
Please tell that to her.

206
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,529
Excuse me.

207
00:22:28,377 --> 00:22:29,143
I'm sorry.

208
00:22:30,576 --> 00:22:31,176
What?

209
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,277
I wondered your wife was here.

210
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,810
She went down stairs.

211
00:22:47,607 --> 00:22:57,379
I was evicted from my Tokyo home and  moved to Shinanojiri Village

212
00:22:58,590 --> 00:23:04,302
Mrs. Yuki has already written about this Shinano tree

213
00:23:08,096 --> 00:23:09,016
Mrs.Yuki.

214
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,420
Your husband is going to be here soon.

215
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,250
I see.

216
00:23:27,827 --> 00:23:29,173
Yes, it's a great winter scenery.

217
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:34,155
Is your husband coming from Kyoto?

218
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:35,806
Yes.

219
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:37,550
It could be.

220
00:23:39,558 --> 00:23:40,733
there's only here and Kyoto.

221
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:50,137
Here is where you can only live.

222
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,394
 Hotel Shinano is the last castle for you.

223
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,490
Do you remember?

224
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,631
Autumn Foliage in Takao.

225
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,319
Yuki-chan's white face was covered in maple leaves

226
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,867
It was not only that.

227
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,669
Looking back...

228
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:16,377
What is love...

229
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:25,503
Underneath it all is something to be feared.

230
00:25:28,175 --> 00:25:28,901
Wife.

231
00:25:35,459 --> 00:25:36,379
Has he arrived?

232
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:37,166
Yes.

233
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:41,355
He is with Kyoto person.

234
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,040
Here is pretty good.

235
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,785
You guys remodel well.

236
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,498
We're lucky.

237
00:26:03,784 --> 00:26:06,455
What happened to Yuki?

238
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:08,145
Please wait in the room over there.

239
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:08,812
Where?

240
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:10,159
Monkey room.

241
00:26:10,635 --> 00:26:14,540
Do you think I am like monkey?

242
00:26:20,173 --> 00:26:22,530
I want to run this hotel too.

243
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:23,768
Hold on.

244
00:26:26,162 --> 00:26:26,922
What happened to Yuki?

245
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:27,775
she is coming.

246
00:26:28,068 --> 00:26:28,908
Let's call her soon

247
00:26:29,195 --> 00:26:29,768
I see.

248
00:27:01,141 --> 00:27:03,076
You can drink too, right?

249
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:03,930
Drink it.

250
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,757
Come here.

251
00:27:17,296 --> 00:27:18,396
You're cute.

252
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:21,277
Remember, the Gion?

253
00:27:21,846 --> 00:27:23,570
on the way back from Gion

254
00:27:24,455 --> 00:27:26,769
It was fun with Kikunaka.

255
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,610
Yes he was with us.

256
00:27:28,639 --> 00:27:31,445
We went to see the autumn leaves.

257
00:27:31,489 --> 00:27:32,878
He looked happy.

258
00:27:32,903 --> 00:27:34,628
Serve her.

259
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:35,915
You serve her.

260
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:38,590
Let's have fun tonight.

261
00:27:42,489 --> 00:27:43,206
Drink it.

262
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,388
What's this?

263
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:51,679
This is Shinshu's iced tofu.

264
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:53,808
This is good for your beauty.

265
00:28:09,678 --> 00:28:12,565
This room is old.

266
00:28:13,002 --> 00:28:14,048
It's old-fashioned.

267
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:16,070
Yuki likes this kind of stuff.

268
00:28:16,615 --> 00:28:18,022
Are you making money?

269
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:18,967
We are in the red

270
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:21,633
I'm managing the money exchange.

271
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:25,329
Yuki, that's a bad hobby

272
00:28:27,097 --> 00:28:28,024
that's a bad hobby

273
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:36,142
Let's have fun more.

274
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:41,777
Let me manage here.

275
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:44,356
You're greedy woman

276
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,026
You told me you wanted to be singer so I made music band for you.

277
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:50,050
You said you wants to be an actress, so next I introduced you a film company.

278
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:51,984
Let me manage here.

279
00:28:55,656 --> 00:28:57,315
I don't feel well.

280
00:28:58,303 --> 00:29:00,563
I'll see you soon.

281
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:02,658
See you later.

282
00:29:23,043 --> 00:29:23,683
Hama

283
00:29:24,156 --> 00:29:24,623
Yes.

284
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:29,463
please come to my room tonight.

285
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,367
Please rest together

286
00:30:58,065 --> 00:30:59,258
It hurts.

287
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:01,206
I can't see the wife

288
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,100
She must be her husband's room.

289
00:31:02,314 --> 00:31:02,768
Really?

290
00:31:03,227 --> 00:31:05,275
She forgot to lock the door so she went upstairs

291
00:31:05,339 --> 00:31:06,541
Then she entered his room.

292
00:31:06,675 --> 00:31:07,255
I can't believe it.

293
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:08,379
She was crying.

294
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:09,165
I can't believe it.

295
00:31:09,239 --> 00:31:09,719
That's true.

296
00:31:49,643 --> 00:31:52,788
Naoyuki-san likes you.

297
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,260
In the end, you are brought back to here.

298
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:00,266
You know about that.

299
00:32:02,719 --> 00:32:05,236
Deep down, you seem to hate Naoyuki

300
00:32:06,104 --> 00:32:07,124
You think so?

301
00:32:08,392 --> 00:32:10,097
You just don't notice it.

302
00:32:12,189 --> 00:32:13,151
You like me.

303
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:29,606
However,you feel guilty about your husband.

304
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,660
she was able to get rid of the feelings of infidelity

305
00:32:35,276 --> 00:32:36,164
That's a ridiculous.

306
00:32:38,496 --> 00:32:40,270
but that's not a virtue or anything

307
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:45,110
There is an old sermon called "Karukaya"

308
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,011
I still perform it in plays around the countryside

309
00:32:50,382 --> 00:32:53,382
The samurai who had lived with her wife and mistress together.

310
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,185
He loved the two of them for a while

311
00:32:59,706 --> 00:33:00,877
One day

312
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:05,250
The women play together at the Sugoroku table

313
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,374
The man was surprised to see the shadow reflected in the shoji screen from outside

314
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:16,563
They were turned into snakes and they started biting each other

315
00:33:19,557 --> 00:33:23,871
The husband was so terrified by the woman's obsession that he spent a year traveling to Mount Koya

316
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:27,550
There's no need to worry about Naoyuki shaving his head though

317
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,570
Your marriage is a kind of planned marriage.

318
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:36,969
You were indifferent to your marriage,

319
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,532
so now you're not emotionally attached to your husband

320
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,749
This old thing doesn't apply to the modern day

321
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,554
In other words, it's material for a play

322
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:48,654
What should I do?

323
00:33:50,145 --> 00:33:51,318
Break up with him.

324
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,270
He won't

325
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,247
It's up to you.

326
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:00,088
So you were here.

327
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:03,001
Where's Aya?

328
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,174
She's taking a bath.

329
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:07,274
She's a woman who likes baths.

330
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,438
By the way, I didn't know you were staying there for a while

331
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,929
I like you.

332
00:34:18,062 --> 00:34:19,815
No one say anything.

333
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,837
I love you

334
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:23,501
thank you for staying at Hotel Shinano

335
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:26,776
it's quiet here.

336
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,676
It's a really good place to write

337
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,261
It's too quiet for me

338
00:34:36,312 --> 00:34:38,856
Yuki, come here.

339
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,686
Yuki-san and I

340
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:50,625
Christmas in the mountains Merry Christmas

341
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:55,369
Let's do something nice

342
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,400
I won in Kyoto.

343
00:34:58,216 --> 00:34:58,642
Let's bid.

344
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,729
What?

345
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:01,236
your most important thing.

346
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:02,448
What's that?

347
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,097
There is.

348
00:35:03,457 --> 00:35:04,157
Tell me.

349
00:35:07,402 --> 00:35:08,169
It's Mrs.Yuki.

350
00:35:18,443 --> 00:35:19,303
Right?

351
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,403
No way.

352
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:23,518
I'll take her.

353
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:28,295
OK.

354
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,046
Are you sure?

355
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:55,935
It's your turn.

356
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,400
Good.

357
00:35:59,191 --> 00:35:59,877
Let's see then

358
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,109
I won

359
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:13,622
I see

360
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:25,271
Where have you been? Merry Christmas

361
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,640
Your bath is long. I don't know where you're washing

362
00:36:30,139 --> 00:36:30,973
What you will give me?

363
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,346
Again.

364
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:49,349
What a nice ring

365
00:36:50,854 --> 00:36:52,314
This is a memento of my mother's.

366
00:36:54,815 --> 00:36:55,792
Buy it for me.

367
00:36:55,879 --> 00:36:56,799
I will.

368
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,340
Let's dance.

369
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:56,799
I got you from Naoyuki

370
00:38:05,118 --> 00:38:06,642
You can see the crystal.

371
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,386
Look, what a wonderful gift.

372
00:38:19,181 --> 00:38:21,401
This is what god made.

373
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,232
No, it's a human too.

374
00:38:28,463 --> 00:38:30,057
Human is made by God.

375
00:38:30,318 --> 00:38:32,264
Men and women.

376
00:38:34,783 --> 00:38:35,416
Yuki.

377
00:38:54,815 --> 00:38:55,542
Yuki.

378
00:39:59,286 --> 00:39:59,913
Wife.

379
00:40:01,207 --> 00:40:02,939
Wife got problem.

380
00:40:04,181 --> 00:40:05,761
Wife got problem.

381
00:40:11,407 --> 00:40:12,187
wife.

382
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:15,687
Yuki.

383
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,459
She didn't wake up so I came to see her.

384
00:40:19,854 --> 00:40:20,827
Then...

385
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:22,177
Does she have a pulse?

386
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,089
Doctor will come right away?

387
00:40:25,114 --> 00:40:26,582
What happened to Naoyuki?

388
00:40:26,607 --> 00:40:28,314
He went to Akakura with her girl.

389
00:40:28,413 --> 00:40:29,086
For fun?

390
00:40:29,243 --> 00:40:30,337
Yes.

391
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:31,984
he is a troubled man

392
00:41:10,610 --> 00:41:11,323
Hey.

393
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:14,004
What happened to Yuki? Is she okay?

394
00:41:14,029 --> 00:41:14,662
She was at home.

395
00:41:14,876 --> 00:41:15,362
What?

396
00:41:15,856 --> 00:41:16,922
Welcome back.

397
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:17,619
What happened to Yuki?

398
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:19,603
Yuki is quietly taking a break now

399
00:41:20,938 --> 00:41:22,184
You bastard!

400
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:24,280
She doesn't want to meet you.

401
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:24,975
What?

402
00:41:27,175 --> 00:41:29,689
Remember the old day in Ueno.

403
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:32,228
I picked you up because you were a clever kid

404
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,871
You are an orphan of war.

405
00:41:38,684 --> 00:41:39,844
Yuki is in another house?

406
00:41:40,570 --> 00:41:41,943
She must be with Kikunaka.

407
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,020
If she hadn't been any danger to her life, I wouldn't have come back

408
00:41:47,894 --> 00:41:48,794
Bring me Brandy.

409
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:03,411
Stay here.

410
00:42:06,836 --> 00:42:08,726
You look upset.

411
00:42:08,996 --> 00:42:10,474
Don't bully your wife.

412
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:14,007
I don't.

413
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,390
Do you have someone named Ayako who your loves?

414
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,536
Yuki is in love with me

415
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:28,897
Yuki, as its name suggests, melts quickly if you just warm it up a little

416
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:33,910
There's a monster living inside Yuki's body

417
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,453
Monster?

418
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:42,777
The monster is a fiery snake

419
00:43:15,997 --> 00:43:17,246
Why did you do that?

420
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,887
Why medicine?

421
00:43:26,163 --> 00:43:33,719
Naoyuki want to leave the management of this house to Ayako-san.

422
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,825
I tried my best.

423
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,348
but you can't.

424
00:43:57,924 --> 00:43:59,410
I was in half way.

425
00:44:02,111 --> 00:44:03,111
For everything.

426
00:44:05,783 --> 00:44:08,570
You're suffering in the storm.

427
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,894
But no matter how hard you work..

428
00:44:13,263 --> 00:44:14,974
I'll try.

429
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,543
Excuse me.

430
00:44:17,053 --> 00:44:19,000
Kikunaga sensei is here?

431
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:20,268
Oh kin.

432
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:22,474
This is a telegram from Tokyo

433
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:34,577
What's about?

434
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:44,123
My wife is in critical condition.

435
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,463
She's been bedridden for five years now.

436
00:44:52,949 --> 00:45:01,110
She's either malnourished or has a chest condition.

437
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,706
We were living in extreme poverty

438
00:45:12,282 --> 00:45:13,648
Let's go home by trian.

439
00:45:22,214 --> 00:45:22,834
You.

440
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:25,660
You can't leave Naoyuki.

441
00:45:28,132 --> 00:45:33,080
You were just disappointed that you lost to someone from Kyoto. You were just frustrated.

442
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:38,463
Hold on.

443
00:45:40,056 --> 00:45:43,056
I'll have Hama-san take you to the station on your way home.

444
00:45:43,723 --> 00:45:45,230
in place of me.

445
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,258
She's a beautiful woman.

446
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,315
The truth is that it cannot be dismissed as old,

447
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:02,039
But...

448
00:46:02,973 --> 00:46:06,520
it is deep and full of secrets and mysteries.

449
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,241
Is that so?

450
00:46:13,778 --> 00:46:15,004
I'll carry it.

451
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,870
Yuki is strong against me,but she's weak against that man

452
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,146
Look, the snow has already melted

453
00:46:35,118 --> 00:46:37,878
She is like a distant snow scape to me

454
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:44,675
How are you feeling?

455
00:47:46,820 --> 00:47:48,292
I heard Kikunaka's gone home.

456
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:53,746
Why are you turning red?

457
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:02,430
I'll let Ayako take charge of here from tomorrow.

458
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,514
You can stay here,

459
00:48:11,589 --> 00:48:13,756
Only Ohin is no use.

460
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:18,870
If things continue like this, even if I borrow money, the interest will be volcanic

461
00:48:19,950 --> 00:48:25,793
Actually, I couldn't go back to Kyoto because I was so debt-ridden

462
00:48:41,136 --> 00:48:45,244
I'm leaving this. I don't want anymore.

463
00:48:53,355 --> 00:48:56,355
I'm really leaving

464
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:01,190
Just for 3 months...

465
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,133
Mrs Yuki too..

466
00:49:39,288 --> 00:49:41,375
13220 yen payment on delivery

467
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:45,530
If she is not educated maid, it's ok.

468
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,176
but she has bachelor's degree

469
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:51,216
Oshidori room's guest is leaving.

470
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,940
Oshidori room's guest is leaving.

471
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:02,626
Three bottles of beer

472
00:50:02,663 --> 00:50:05,260
Towel, toothbrush,some cigarettes,

473
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,263
Please add these amounts as well

474
00:50:10,971 --> 00:50:12,005
I'm off to the station.

475
00:50:14,078 --> 00:50:15,805
Buy medicine for cold.

476
00:50:16,534 --> 00:50:18,394
Hey,Come here.

477
00:50:20,421 --> 00:50:21,735
Hey, hey Kikunaga-san will come.

478
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:25,234
You look so nice.

479
00:50:25,888 --> 00:50:28,468
I'll come to the station to pick him up.

480
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:30,659
You spend money very lavishly.

481
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,820
You embezzle from the books.

482
00:50:34,078 --> 00:50:36,160
I don't.
Check the book keep.

483
00:50:41,835 --> 00:50:43,221
What are you going to do with her?

484
00:50:43,637 --> 00:50:44,710
I'm off to the station.

485
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:45,663
Hey.

486
00:50:49,307 --> 00:50:50,335
I'm make up for it.

487
00:50:52,765 --> 00:50:53,619
Are you?

488
00:50:54,435 --> 00:50:55,768
I'll sell my personal belonging.

489
00:50:58,803 --> 00:51:02,766
We already sold that diamond.

490
00:51:03,956 --> 00:51:05,980
I didn't know that.

491
00:51:07,073 --> 00:51:07,920
You're lying.

492
00:51:08,531 --> 00:51:09,724
I didn't know that.

493
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:14,890
Yuki is the legal wife and I am just mistress.

494
00:51:17,703 --> 00:51:21,318
Marry me,  marry me

495
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:27,722
Marry me,  marry me

496
00:51:29,556 --> 00:51:31,839
That's a good idea, let's do that

497
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:36,533
Kick that person out.

498
00:51:38,872 --> 00:51:40,586
Leave her here.

499
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,820
You'll probably be able to be legal wife.

500
00:51:46,699 --> 00:51:48,866
What are you talking about?

501
00:51:49,056 --> 00:51:50,930
You have unfinished business with YUKI.

502
00:51:52,466 --> 00:51:55,854
You have been taken care by him
You look down on me.

503
00:51:58,513 --> 00:52:01,321
I took care of his parents and siblings, and finally it was all over

504
00:52:05,062 --> 00:52:08,413
Who can live with legal wife and mistress together?

505
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:16,038
Hey,I feel like crying. .

506
00:52:18,545 --> 00:52:21,558
What's wrong with this family?

507
00:52:22,850 --> 00:52:25,850
The winds of life are blowing all over the world

508
00:52:26,710 --> 00:52:29,710
I hope you die because you are causing trouble for other people

509
00:52:31,176 --> 00:52:32,308
It would be better if you died.

510
00:52:34,101 --> 00:52:36,194
I hope you die.

511
00:52:39,477 --> 00:52:40,563
Stop it....

512
00:52:40,717 --> 00:52:41,810
Stop it....

513
00:52:41,998 --> 00:52:43,505
Darling...

514
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:03,873
Do you feel cold?

515
00:53:06,669 --> 00:53:07,563
Where's Yuki?

516
00:53:07,945 --> 00:53:09,491
Yuki-san has moved.

517
00:53:09,835 --> 00:53:10,429
Eh?

518
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:12,491
To The back of the park.

519
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,423
I see.

520
00:53:16,198 --> 00:53:17,671
The Kyoto woman caused trouble.

521
00:53:18,138 --> 00:53:18,631
Yes.

522
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,660
I'll take some rest too.

523
00:53:24,231 --> 00:53:25,304
please tell Yuki-san

524
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:29,667
I would be waiting her in the basement hall in two hours.

525
00:53:32,591 --> 00:53:33,118
You get it?

526
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,247
Yes.

527
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:14,739
No one can die alone.

528
00:54:16,147 --> 00:54:20,343
Now or tomorrow...

529
00:54:25,999 --> 00:54:27,959
how can even our hearts not die?

530
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:35,371
When you die, life is like a shadow.

531
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:16,864
I thought you'd come.

532
00:55:19,095 --> 00:55:20,235
It will be a while.

533
00:55:23,786 --> 00:55:24,539
What is that?

534
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,203
It's the sound of ice

535
00:55:27,731 --> 00:55:28,498
It's the sound of ice?

536
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:31,374
The ice on the lake is cracking.

537
00:55:32,635 --> 00:55:34,068
They are screaming with excitement.

538
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:39,800
Did you know this poem?

539
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:48,721
I love these ice, I love these fleeting thoughts.

540
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:57,319
I love those bright, unscented flowers

541
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,830
I sympathize with what lies beneath the ice

542
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,640
I always encourage my life.

543
00:56:11,255 --> 00:56:14,255
The moment when we groan in the fragrance of life

544
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:20,233
I love these ice.

545
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,679
I love these fleeting thoughts.

546
00:56:24,765 --> 00:56:27,712
I love these fleeting thoughts.

547
00:56:30,047 --> 00:56:32,119
Let's put on fire.

548
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:33,886
I can't.

549
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:48,120
I didn't know how to put it on.

550
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:55,329
You are ohin after all.
Your hand is as cold as ice.

551
00:56:57,053 --> 00:56:58,393
Where's your wife?

552
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,753
She's dead.

553
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,282
She passed away?

554
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:02,838
When I arrived in Tokyo

555
00:57:03,016 --> 00:57:04,637
She had already taken his last breath.

556
00:57:05,112 --> 00:57:06,339
I didn't know

557
00:57:06,482 --> 00:57:08,927
I didn't tell everyone.

558
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:35,590
Yuki-san.

559
00:57:49,964 --> 00:57:52,037
This is not good idea.

560
01:01:03,694 --> 01:01:05,380
I'll marry to Hamako.

561
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,990
I love the pure heart of a virgin

562
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,639
But I will never forget that stern response, the cracking of the icy ice.

563
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,640
You live in a different world than me

564
01:01:34,382 --> 01:01:39,908
It's because of snowing. It might be because of the snow

565
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:45,003
It's spring in Japan now, after a long war

566
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:49,745
The sound of the spring

567
01:01:53,605 --> 01:01:55,818
You will disappears along with that sound.

568
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:58,024
That may be your destiny

569
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:03,556
The chilling sound of ice cracking

570
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,914
I love these fleeting thoughts

571
01:02:19,263 --> 01:02:22,263
He loves you.

572
01:02:23,889 --> 01:02:31,445
So by marrying me, he wants to forget about you.

573
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:37,440
I love you too, ma'am.

574
01:02:50,161 --> 01:02:52,494
I hope you take care of yourself

575
01:02:58,005 --> 01:02:58,885
Excuse me.

576
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,192
Hama-san.

577
01:03:06,412 --> 01:03:07,365
Be happy

578
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:08,338
ma'am.

579
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:18,568
For me.

580
01:04:44,555 --> 01:04:47,488
A dirty blood.

581
01:06:34,503 --> 01:06:35,356
You.

582
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,539
You probably don't own a knife,right?

583
01:06:41,496 --> 01:06:42,157
hysteria.

584
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:49,234
You can't live without me.

585
01:07:10,464 --> 01:07:11,377
Who are you!

586
01:07:11,627 --> 01:07:13,100
I kill you!

587
01:07:13,125 --> 01:07:14,007
You dude!

588
01:07:44,703 --> 01:07:47,703
What's wrong? I LOVEYOU.

589
01:07:48,939 --> 01:07:50,145
What happened?

590
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,672
Wait a min.

591
01:07:51,985 --> 01:07:53,345
What happened?

592
01:07:56,807 --> 01:07:57,347
You dude!

593
01:07:59,212 --> 01:07:59,918
Master.

594
01:08:00,746 --> 01:08:02,139
What happened?

595
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:06,832
He was trying to kill me.

596
01:08:07,393 --> 01:08:08,593
It's attempted murder.

597
01:08:08,618 --> 01:08:10,287
Say sorry to him.

598
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:14,574
Damn it.

599
01:08:19,523 --> 01:08:20,643
He's idiot.

600
01:08:23,543 --> 01:08:26,497
Where's master?

601
01:09:41,039 --> 01:09:41,732
Yuki.

602
01:09:42,765 --> 01:09:44,013
Did you know that?

603
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,023
Well, I had a vague feeling that.

604
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:52,573
It was okay.

605
01:09:52,598 --> 01:09:54,022
Take a rest.

606
01:10:01,129 --> 01:10:02,115
misfortunes never come singly

607
01:10:05,020 --> 01:10:06,078
I was kicked out

608
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:09,541
This house has been taken.

609
01:10:10,928 --> 01:10:12,328
They changed the registered name.

610
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,141
will you come with me?

611
01:10:16,648 --> 01:10:17,448
Where are you going?

612
01:10:17,628 --> 01:10:18,568
Kansai.

613
01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:22,773
If you go there, there are a lot of people I've taken care of

614
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:29,774
Let's see, I'll ask Kyoka in Gion.
She is doing Geisha business.

615
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,965
She'd be happy.

616
01:10:37,497 --> 01:10:39,344
How about my baby?

617
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:41,231
Get an abortion.

618
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:43,287
I don't want.

619
01:10:49,062 --> 01:10:49,636
Listen,

620
01:10:50,099 --> 01:10:53,701
It was because of you that I played around with women.

621
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:58,154
Same for Ayako, there's no such thing as a worthless woman

622
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,397
So you are my treasure

623
01:11:01,150 --> 01:11:03,836
You can't leave me and neither can I

624
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,196
You know that, don't you?

625
01:11:08,226 --> 01:11:13,102
We are well matched couple.

626
01:11:17,140 --> 01:11:19,311
I beg you, go with me

627
01:11:20,780 --> 01:11:22,217
I'm going to get the first train.
Hurry up.

628
01:11:23,170 --> 01:11:24,524
Get ready soon.

629
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,370
Can you go with me? then I'll be waiting downstairs when it's ready

630
01:11:31,246 --> 01:11:31,999
I beg you.

631
01:11:36,315 --> 01:11:39,102
Damn it!
Don't look down on me.

632
01:11:41,308 --> 01:11:43,103
I'll get you back.

633
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:49,407
Please

634
01:12:53,963 --> 01:12:55,435
You are lonely woman.

635
01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:00,982
I'm lonely too.

636
01:13:12,304 --> 01:13:16,693
I am an orphan.
You are noble.

637
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:20,594
But we are lonely.

638
01:13:25,742 --> 01:13:29,274
Madam, I will accompany you.

639
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:33,987
Where are we going?

640
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:35,488
across the sea.

641
01:13:38,471 --> 01:13:39,264
across the sea?

642
01:13:43,263 --> 01:13:46,263
There is a quiet place around Matsugasaki

643
01:13:47,670 --> 01:13:48,530
There is a quiet place?

644
01:13:51,571 --> 01:13:55,060
It's not good to have you as a geisha.

645
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:56,597
I don't like it

646
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:09,029
Wife, please come with me

647
01:14:11,353 --> 01:14:12,113
I beg you.

648
01:14:14,932 --> 01:14:15,872
Wife

649
01:14:19,302 --> 01:14:19,822
Wife

650
01:14:23,169 --> 01:14:26,169
Wife, please go together

651
01:14:27,247 --> 01:14:27,934
Wife.

652
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:32,011
Let's go.

653
01:15:13,029 --> 01:15:15,203
Isn't it beautiful, ma'am?

654
01:15:17,594 --> 01:15:19,227
It feels like spring already.

655
01:17:18,160 --> 01:17:21,160
You can see the Village there.

656
01:19:02,326 --> 01:19:04,484
I'll look back..

657
01:19:06,002 --> 01:19:10,838
Love is the shadow of a mask.

658
01:19:12,516 --> 01:19:17,609
Underneath it all is a fearful shame.

659
01:19:19,143 --> 01:19:19,916
Madam Yuki?

660
01:19:20,396 --> 01:19:24,802
Were you born in such a remote mountain area?
What  a clear evening.

661
01:19:26,268 --> 01:19:27,308
You can see the mountains

662
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:32,350
Myoko Kurohime Iizuma

663
01:19:34,427 --> 01:19:35,521
hama-chan said

664
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:39,281
You are like a snow.

665
01:21:05,653 --> 01:21:07,186
Here's your tea.

666
01:21:08,365 --> 01:21:11,030
The ice melts, spring is near.

667
01:21:11,674 --> 01:21:12,434
Seitaro.

668
01:21:13,468 --> 01:21:16,468
Butterbur Blossom Blossoms by the Waterside.

669
01:21:19,878 --> 01:21:20,618
Wife.

670
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,620
Would you like me to give you a shoulder massage?

671
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:23,178
No.

672
01:21:23,835 --> 01:21:25,228
you can have an apple.

673
01:21:26,045 --> 01:21:28,429
I'm fine with that. Will you get heat?

674
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,630
Lemon, look, I bought it here

675
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:36,054
These are too sour.

676
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,249
I don't understand.

677
01:21:42,660 --> 01:21:43,760
Will you get heat?

678
01:21:57,558 --> 01:21:58,498
Wife.

679
01:22:02,019 --> 01:22:06,332
Is this your husband's baby?

680
01:22:09,687 --> 01:22:11,090
Or Kikunaga's?

681
01:22:13,118 --> 01:22:14,231
I know everything.

682
01:22:15,733 --> 01:22:19,225
Mr. Kikunaga didn't get Hama-chan instead of you.

683
01:22:21,818 --> 01:22:23,404
You are snow.

684
01:22:23,870 --> 01:22:27,990
Hama-chan is just mud. Mud can't turn into snow

685
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,599
A maid is more convenient for taking care of one's personal needs.

686
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,972
I wonder my baby is being healthy...

687
01:22:50,576 --> 01:22:52,967
you're a helpless person.

688
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:59,560
You can't do any of the housework or laundry that other people can do.

689
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:02,974
That's why you are beautiful.

690
01:23:04,608 --> 01:23:06,796
I told you it's beautiful because of the snow.

691
01:23:10,766 --> 01:23:14,102
Your husband is a jerk, but for some reason you like him.

692
01:23:15,587 --> 01:23:16,580
I don't understand about you guys.

693
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:18,737
So I wanted to kill him

694
01:23:20,746 --> 01:23:25,044
I want to kill Kikunaga too. He stole your heart.

695
01:23:25,713 --> 01:23:29,301
And because you are too noble, he ran away.

696
01:23:29,994 --> 01:23:31,060
I feel good.

697
01:23:31,758 --> 01:23:33,126
You don't know about my feeling.

698
01:23:33,191 --> 01:23:33,993
I don't know.

699
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:36,098
I don't know for me.

700
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:41,085
Let's go to Tokyo.

701
01:23:44,630 --> 01:23:45,699
Come with me to Tokyo.

702
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:51,187
Yes, I'll work there.

703
01:23:51,740 --> 01:23:53,926
I can do anything, even as a waiter or a bartender

704
01:23:54,030 --> 01:23:59,281
Take good care of you and feed you at least one meal.

705
01:24:04,180 --> 01:24:12,375
Your wife is too beautiful to live in this murky world

706
01:24:14,890 --> 01:24:17,890
But please stay as snow fairy all the time.

707
01:24:23,470 --> 01:24:26,470
Thank you Sentaro.

708
01:24:32,844 --> 01:24:33,771
thank you.

709
01:24:34,913 --> 01:24:37,913
Madam, would you like me to massage you?

710
01:24:46,218 --> 01:24:47,451
You're really stiff

711
01:24:49,160 --> 01:24:53,753
In truth, I would even give my life for you.

712
01:24:55,590 --> 01:24:59,132
If you ask me for my life, I will die immediately without any hesitation

713
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,246
I would happily die

714
01:25:04,848 --> 01:25:08,080
I won't let anyone to get you.

715
01:25:15,989 --> 01:25:17,069
Wife!

716
01:26:27,171 --> 01:26:35,563
Naokoyuki..I should go mad and die

717
01:26:53,057 --> 01:26:54,243
Kikunaka....

718
01:27:16,363 --> 01:27:19,363
bloodstained.

719
01:27:32,131 --> 01:27:33,297
I have to die.

720
01:29:25,209 --> 01:29:27,232
Mrs. Yuki!

721
01:29:30,325 --> 01:29:33,678
Mrs. Yuki!

722
01:29:35,775 --> 01:29:37,042
Mrs. Yuki!

723
01:30:02,157 --> 01:30:08,459
THE END

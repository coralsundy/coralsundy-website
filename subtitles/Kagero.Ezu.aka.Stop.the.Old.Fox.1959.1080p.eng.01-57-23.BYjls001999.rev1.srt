<i>Kagero Ezu /  Stop the Old Fox (1959)</i>

3
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:54,252
In the 11th year of the Tenpo era,

4
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,012
the 11th shogun of the Tokugawa family has retired and become the elder statesman,

5
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:02,960
and it has already been three years

6
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:11,182
The actual control of the shogunate has passed to the current shogun Hideyoshi and remains firmly under the influence of the elder statesman.

7
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:17,121
This is a story of the people writhing in that absurdity

8
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,819
It was a heavy rain.

9
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,863
This kind of rain is making everyone nervous.

10
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:32,209
Taro Mukojima's lord is indeed a person of fortune

11
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,340
He returned home at the right time.

12
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,044
I am known as Okumura Daizen for the Maeda family

13
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,526
Is there something to change into?

14
00:02:45,023 --> 00:02:46,291
Please wait a moment

15
00:02:48,595 --> 00:02:50,708
What a rain.

16
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,172
Rokubei.

17
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,026
Yes.

18
00:03:06,434 --> 00:03:09,659
It seems the rain has stopped, but We can't be able to go to the roof anymore.

19
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,580
First of all, that's not good

20
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:13,844
Do you also repair leaks?

21
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:16,570
We have also handle of it.

22
00:03:20,299 --> 00:03:21,145
Ochiai.

23
00:03:21,663 --> 00:03:25,312
Myosenji's Godaisan is calling you.

24
00:03:25,637 --> 00:03:26,477
Oh no.

25
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:29,205
here we go again.

26
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:08,512
I can't keep this vague forever.

27
00:04:09,323 --> 00:04:14,435
Just let my intentions leak even a little
to the main keep, and see what happens

28
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,501
Today, I must absolutely report to the lord.

29
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,939
Mukojima's lord said

30
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:33,162
He's going to have a bath.

31
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,637
Bath?

32
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,736
Well, it takes time again.

33
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:43,503
In the meantime, I will see Omiyo.

34
00:04:44,313 --> 00:04:46,335
I'll call him.

35
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:48,089
I'll go.

36
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:56,023
Recently,I hear there is a maid who has been transferred.

37
00:04:57,123 --> 00:04:58,210
What is her name?

38
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,538
She's called Tomi.

39
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,830
Ask her to bring a tea for me.

40
00:05:22,051 --> 00:05:26,335
Nakano is passing by Okuno room

41
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,629
Nakano is passing by.

42
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:46,690
How are you?

43
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,275
You look so nice.

44
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,451
Mr. Grand Master seems to be in a good mood these days.

45
00:06:01,558 --> 00:06:02,611
My dad?

46
00:06:03,631 --> 00:06:05,733
Yes that's right.

47
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:13,233
Actually, I went to my hometown yesterday
and met Inuchiyo.

48
00:06:14,103 --> 00:06:14,923
Inuchiyo?

49
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,058
Has she been in good spirits?

50
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:22,646
She was very rambunctious.

51
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:27,282
I wanna see her once.

52
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,818
They say that grandchildren are cuter than their own children

53
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:36,863
At that young age, I already have a grandchild,

54
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,666
To my father, she is his great-grandson.

55
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:46,634
I want her to be in control and take

56
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:51,484
Will she be living in the general's house?

57
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,761
Very soon.

58
00:06:55,022 --> 00:06:58,002
But it will take times.

59
00:06:58,832 --> 00:07:03,632
Inuchiyo is beloved grandchild.

60
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:09,222
No wonder she is taking over as General.

61
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,816
I can't say it's just that

62
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,272
In Main house, it is to properly fulfill the duties of a shogun

63
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:20,835
Who?

64
00:07:21,796 --> 00:07:23,103
I'm Tomi

65
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,812
I didn't call you.

66
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:27,812
I asked her to bring a tea.

67
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,568
It doesn't matter,come in.

68
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:31,545
Tomi.

69
00:08:33,438 --> 00:08:35,881
Since when are you working at the castle?

70
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,649
since around the end of February

71
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,943
It's unusual to have risen to such a position in just four months in the third circle

72
00:08:51,449 --> 00:08:58,501
You owe them a debt of gratitude.

73
00:09:01,718 --> 00:09:02,692
Please leave.

74
00:09:44,795 --> 00:09:48,149
Is there something troubling her?

75
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:53,312
That woman is at the cherry blossom viewing contest in Ota

76
00:09:53,382 --> 00:09:56,382
She offered a stepping chair, didn't she?

77
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,035
As a result, the Otaki suffered a miscarriage and came to an end

78
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:20,391
The Ogosho favor returned to Omiyo once again

79
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:25,850
That's fine, but she's so clever.

80
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:37,299
No one doubt the stepping chair?

81
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,308
The stepping chair should be here
in the Nishi-no-Maru

82
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:43,489
I think so.

83
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,605
In any case, it's an incomprehensible story;

84
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:52,390
I have taken her into my hands

85
00:11:52,926 --> 00:11:54,965
Was it inconvenient for you?

86
00:11:55,177 --> 00:12:02,516
No, if you had taken her in, that woman would have
faced severe punishment at the Takino residence

87
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:05,286
Anyway.

88
00:12:06,283 --> 00:12:10,975
You should firmly grasp the heart of the great lord,

89
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,113
Everything won't go well

90
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:15,321
See?

91
00:12:16,247 --> 00:12:16,821
Yes.

92
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,373
What happened to Sekiou?

93
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:34,889
He met Omiyo and

94
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:38,886
he will go to seek the judgment of the lord from the main keep,

95
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:47,792
Lately, I value the General's decisions more than the head family's. Is there anything you would have done differently?

96
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,283
Not really.

97
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:54,197
Please be silent on the orders from the head family.

98
00:12:54,826 --> 00:12:57,882
Please do not hesitate to acknowledge anything that you think is important

99
00:12:59,023 --> 00:13:03,767
Also, when the shogun's family is crossing over and having a discussion with the great elder,

100
00:13:04,756 --> 00:13:09,051
Make sure to understand the situation of the conversation without missing any details

101
00:13:09,404 --> 00:13:10,484
We get it.

102
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,579
I would like to address the lord of Mukojima

103
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,071
Sanada shinano is waiting for you at the entrance.

104
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:33,629
If there is something to discuss, tell him to come
to Mukojima.

105
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,160
then I will meet with the great lord.

106
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,436
Miyo.

107
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:47,403
I have a maid named Tomi who was recently introduced to me by Omiyo.

108
00:13:48,196 --> 00:13:49,749
Where's she from?

109
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,821
As far as I know, she was from Shimada Matazaemon

110
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,084
Six years ago,she was transferred.

111
00:13:57,364 --> 00:13:57,864
To Moyaku?

112
00:13:58,144 --> 00:13:58,624
Yes.

113
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:02,266
I need a background check on her.

114
00:14:03,036 --> 00:14:06,036
Ask Shitamura, in Hachibori,

115
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:09,498
Please check her.

116
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,946
Akame Ryume know everything.

117
00:14:32,936 --> 00:14:36,058
please forgive me for being played with

118
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,621
What's wrong?

119
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,428
I have leg pain.

120
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:45,459
My shoulder numb,

121
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:51,935
do you have any pain?

122
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,421
There is no pain.

123
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,821
I have been frequently asked from the main house.

124
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:16,042
but what do you think about being old lord at Sanada?

125
00:15:16,569 --> 00:15:21,657
I think it's too early.

126
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:22,917
You think so?

127
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,625
or will I decline?

128
00:15:28,214 --> 00:15:29,274
Yesterday,

129
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:31,911
I inquired about the princess's mood

130
00:15:32,186 --> 00:15:37,181
and had the pleasure of meeting your grandchild,

131
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:43,569
She has big eyes and so pretty.

132
00:15:43,996 --> 00:15:47,135
How old is she now?

133
00:15:47,215 --> 00:15:49,672
She's 6-year-old.

134
00:15:50,026 --> 00:15:53,700
Please visit her once.

135
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,452
Yes sure.

136
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,768
Talk to her about things then.

137
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,851
I have been repeatedly urged to follow up,

138
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,195
but the matter of the heir must not reach

139
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:12,220
I have to talk to her in secret about the succession.

140
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:18,353
I believe you are indebted to the Shoguns.

141
00:16:18,634 --> 00:16:19,727
It could be.

142
00:16:20,798 --> 00:16:27,422
I'm getting old too; I need to decide on the future quickly,

143
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:34,084
Shall we decide on INUCHIYO as the successor to INUYOSHI?

144
00:16:35,357 --> 00:16:37,989
We have to get that approved first.

145
00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:40,389
Yes.

146
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,803
That's right, I should write this down

147
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:29,238
Are you getting fat?

148
00:17:30,986 --> 00:17:33,173
There's no way to get fat.

149
00:17:34,026 --> 00:17:37,026
I'm getting slim.

150
00:17:37,885 --> 00:17:41,963
You must be forgetting about me.

151
00:17:43,052 --> 00:17:44,993
Don't get me wrong.

152
00:17:45,715 --> 00:17:48,082
I'm taking care of you.

153
00:17:49,366 --> 00:17:52,732
You have many women.

154
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:56,104
I can't trust you.

155
00:17:56,382 --> 00:17:58,215
I'm old.

156
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,480
my body can't keep up with the passing time

157
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,846
It's no good now

158
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,683
Don't say like that.

159
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,930
Are you leaving from Miyo?

160
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,599
Stop suspect me.

161
00:18:15,366 --> 00:18:17,311
I only need you.

162
00:18:17,937 --> 00:18:21,617
Are you sure?

163
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,005
Yeah.

164
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:27,550
I can show you what's in my heart if you want

165
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:35,486
Is it alright if one person takes it?

166
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:37,103
Sure.

167
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,914
Thank you very much.

168
00:18:44,158 --> 00:18:48,213
Will Inuchiyo be the successor?

169
00:18:48,556 --> 00:18:51,337
I heard like that.

170
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:57,744
Tell me the detail.

171
00:19:15,861 --> 00:19:18,861
I'll tell you

172
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:27,336
as I suppress my soaring heart in vain,
alone in a dream that remains unfulfilled,

173
00:19:27,361 --> 00:19:28,954
Who's the name of opposite?

174
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:33,755
Koei is coming.

175
00:19:34,071 --> 00:19:35,285
Koei from Chigenji?

176
00:19:36,165 --> 00:19:37,721
Is he that the monk?

177
00:19:40,399 --> 00:19:42,818
He resembles Kikunojou.

178
00:19:42,843 --> 00:19:45,985
I didn't know Rui and Harino were together.

179
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,414
She is a strategist.

180
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,575
I am just dozing off, lost in a dream,

181
00:20:10,771 --> 00:20:14,324
If it is just a prank, it is too late for him to wake up

182
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:18,312
I don't want to see the color of that.

183
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:23,372
My heart aches when I think of you.

184
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:24,701
From Ruri.

185
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,459
For Koei.

186
00:20:29,924 --> 00:20:31,228
For Koei?

187
00:20:31,677 --> 00:20:34,574
Is he a monk in Hanryu?

188
00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:38,930
He is resembling a actor.

189
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,842
Tell us more detail.

190
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,620
I'll tell everyone.

191
00:21:05,336 --> 00:21:08,588
Oshinomoto.

192
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:16,290
I wanted to see you.

193
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,416
Someone saw me

194
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,557
Your face?

195
00:22:18,582 --> 00:22:20,269
No. how about you?

196
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:22,429
Don't worry.

197
00:22:22,682 --> 00:22:25,682
Let's think of it as the usual fox-shaped prank

198
00:22:27,838 --> 00:22:28,871
Come in.

199
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,032
Whoa, you're Ochiai

200
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,843
This is Makoto Shimomura from North city.

201
00:23:47,243 --> 00:23:48,387
It's been ages.

202
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,336
Do you have a maid's errand inside?

203
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:52,429
Nothing.

204
00:23:53,155 --> 00:23:55,751
She resembled someone I know quite well

205
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,882
Who lives in this residence?

206
00:23:58,249 --> 00:24:01,249
Matazaimon Shimada's

207
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:01,980
I see.

208
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:06,585
I'm busy now, see you later.

209
00:24:06,648 --> 00:24:07,683
Thanks for your hard work.

210
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,711
Could you close that and keep an eye on the inside of the gate?

211
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:39,659
According to the letter that you sent recently,

212
00:24:40,152 --> 00:24:44,812
it seems you are still supporting otaki

213
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Please forget about him

214
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You must grasp the proof sooner than that

215
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:59,224
Wakizaka Awaji is counting on you.

216
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,216
It may be difficult, but for the sake of the greater good,

217
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:05,247
you must take action

218
00:25:05,546 --> 00:25:06,146
Ok?

219
00:25:06,699 --> 00:25:07,520
Yes.

220
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:12,588
What happened to the missing step chair on the day of the cherry blossom viewing?

221
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:13,954
I can't find it,

222
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:14,881
Still missing?

223
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,822
or did someone take it away?

224
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:22,941
It was the paint on the chair that caused her to fall.

225
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,315
then there is no way we can live like this

226
00:25:28,253 --> 00:25:30,038
Oharu is visiting you.

227
00:25:30,816 --> 00:25:31,703
She's here?

228
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:33,282
Oh really?

229
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:35,288
I informed her.

230
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:51,110
Sorry for being late

231
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:52,517
I'm glad you came

232
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:58,202
Dear sister, Lord. How are you?

233
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,005
but I'm grateful to hear that
you are doing well

234
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,912
Thank you very much.

235
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,486
Today, I received a special notice,

236
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,515
and I thought you might want to see us.

237
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,495
How's shinnozuke?

238
00:26:14,048 --> 00:26:14,821
Yes.

239
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:21,884
I want to be your apprentice too.

240
00:26:23,132 --> 00:26:24,498
Are you?

241
00:26:24,523 --> 00:26:27,564
I hope I’m not causing trouble for the neighbors

242
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,978
Let's take our time to talk

243
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:43,113
How're you?

244
00:26:46,349 --> 00:26:47,502
I want to be your apprentice too.

245
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,606
I'm glad to hear you're doing well,

246
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,342
I don’t know much about the situation,

247
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,680
but I’ve heard you have a challenging role,

248
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,467
and that worries me

249
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,617
Sometimes, when I think of you,

250
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,021
I can’t help but feel concerned

251
00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:08,578
There are times when I can't sleep all night

252
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,910
I'm sorry for that much

253
00:27:18,869 --> 00:27:23,192
You also owe a debt of
gratitude to this lord for raising you

254
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:27,491
I understand the feeling of wanting to be helpful even at the cost of your life

255
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:32,836
I really don't want to take life for granted, no matter what

256
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:34,181
Yes.

257
00:27:34,915 --> 00:27:37,289
please don't forget what I've just said

258
00:27:38,535 --> 00:27:41,070
I get it.

259
00:27:42,166 --> 00:27:45,476
After all, we are just two
brothers in heaven and on earth

260
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:49,309
Even if we have to live apart like this, at least

261
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:53,341
we should know that we are both safe

262
00:27:55,636 --> 00:27:57,962
I never take my life lightly

263
00:27:58,476 --> 00:27:59,436
Please understand.

264
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:11,646
This is now on sale at Chōjiya

265
00:28:11,869 --> 00:28:15,683
This makeup is very nice.

266
00:28:17,643 --> 00:28:19,509
For me?

267
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,443
This is the Myojin charm

268
00:28:23,642 --> 00:28:25,873
Please apply it to your body,

269
00:28:27,824 --> 00:28:29,160
thank you

270
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:33,710
From the top of your head to the tips of your toes,

271
00:28:33,796 --> 00:28:36,179
You have completely acquired.

272
00:28:37,199 --> 00:28:38,739
You'll look better.

273
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,108
You look better too

274
00:28:45,152 --> 00:28:48,152
I have adapted to the lifestyle of the underclass, you know

275
00:28:49,606 --> 00:28:54,256
I wish you would stop by my place,

276
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,368
but I don't want that

277
00:28:56,456 --> 00:28:58,348
If you show off,

278
00:28:58,373 --> 00:29:01,234
it would be a problem for me

279
00:29:03,082 --> 00:29:06,082
When did you start saying things like that?

280
00:29:14,447 --> 00:29:16,851
There's a strange-looking guy wandering around

281
00:29:16,876 --> 00:29:17,582
Really?

282
00:29:17,702 --> 00:29:18,602
Where's lord?

283
00:29:18,842 --> 00:29:20,069
In back room.

284
00:29:28,025 --> 00:29:29,139
Who's he?

285
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,105
He seems a craftsman.

286
00:29:35,668 --> 00:29:37,794
Hi, this is Rokubei.

287
00:29:42,121 --> 00:29:43,407
Did you come?

288
00:29:43,432 --> 00:29:44,487
The sis is here?

289
00:29:45,276 --> 00:29:47,076
I think my sister is over there

290
00:29:47,435 --> 00:29:51,107
Hachobori is chasing her.

291
00:29:51,621 --> 00:29:52,141
Outside?

292
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:57,017
I would like to head to Mr.Wakisaka's residence with nei

293
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:00,580
but could you help me bring her out smoothly?

294
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,947
I'll leave later.

295
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:04,286
I get it.

296
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:11,895
You can't stop talking.

297
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,443
Our lord has granted us permission.

298
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,922
I would like to ask you a few things.

299
00:30:19,372 --> 00:30:20,032
Yes.

300
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,796
It seems you visited the mansion,

301
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,333
but Is he an acquaintance?

302
00:30:52,739 --> 00:30:56,200
I am here for my practice

303
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,796
Lord Shimada's practice of the Tomimoto?

304
00:31:13,657 --> 00:31:15,850
It is a bit too early for singing practice.

305
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:19,007
Today, we had some guests come over

306
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,376
Speaking of which, there seems to be another female guest.

307
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,676
Yeah.

308
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,261
I didn't get to meet her.

309
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,751
but I have some errand towards Mr. Shimada?

310
00:31:27,776 --> 00:31:28,771
Well....nothing.

311
00:31:40,986 --> 00:31:41,799
Nitaru

312
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:51,072
We are still waiting for your announcement, Mr. Daimon

313
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,338
I see, I'll see him.

314
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,168
Take care of him.

315
00:32:16,095 --> 00:32:17,768
Sorry for making you wait.

316
00:32:18,999 --> 00:32:20,696
I'm glad you came with Nei.

317
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,970
What can we do for you?

318
00:32:25,023 --> 00:32:30,571
Today, in the main keep, I received a stern reprimand
from the Shogun along with the elderly ones,

319
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,183
I have also heard that the Shogun has expressed some dissatisfaction

320
00:32:38,271 --> 00:32:39,198
Don't worry.

321
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:40,857
Stay here.

322
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,946
As you know

323
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:50,891
The Ogosho decides everything.

324
00:32:51,969 --> 00:32:57,586
Although I am the general, I have no decision-making power.

325
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:02,578
He said you were accepting

326
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:07,953
But he's had enough of you.

327
00:33:08,235 --> 00:33:08,891
I see.

328
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:12,165
Hayashi shigonokami

329
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,336
Hayashi Shu is a god of good fortune

330
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:17,270
They are trying to improve their status

331
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:20,781
If they get to the top, the right path will not be opened.

332
00:33:22,374 --> 00:33:25,610
The elders also made their decision.

333
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:29,383
But they don't know anything about you

334
00:33:30,095 --> 00:33:32,625
Everything must be done in secrecy

335
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,875
If our actions fail,

336
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:40,455
You have to cut your stomach yourself

337
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,516
You have to take pride in this action.

338
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,844
Matazimon,Nui

339
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,211
You guys make an effort

340
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,899
Are there any problems with OKU homes?

341
00:33:58,614 --> 00:33:59,227
Yes

342
00:34:01,687 --> 00:34:05,047
There seems to be some trouble there

343
00:34:05,665 --> 00:34:07,001
I see.

344
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,071
Rui.

345
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:14,617
You are not here to investigate OKUJO.

346
00:34:15,378 --> 00:34:18,781
The goal is to correct the political disorder that lies beyond it

347
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:22,711
Their research is the first step.

348
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,360
But this is a skill that only a woman can do

349
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,150
Listen, I'm counting on you

350
00:34:32,462 --> 00:34:33,196
Yes.

351
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:39,492
Sekiuo is in Ishinomaki with Ushinomaru, right?

352
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:40,610
Yes.

353
00:34:41,438 --> 00:34:45,219
Apparently Negi came before him.

354
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:46,758
Really?

355
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,391
I've suspected she was coming to the castle for some time now.

356
00:34:53,477 --> 00:34:54,165
So?

357
00:34:55,153 --> 00:34:58,153
She has been working in Sanno rooms for 4 months now.

358
00:34:58,873 --> 00:35:00,835
Her rise is so fast

359
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,102
Sekiuo did it?

360
00:35:05,873 --> 00:35:09,797
Did he notice something? Perhaps?

361
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:14,274
Nui

362
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:17,578
About Omiyo

363
00:35:18,186 --> 00:35:21,186
On the surface, she is said to be the daughter of Sekiuo

364
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:25,149
but in reality, she is the daughter of the
head priest of the Yanaka Kannon Temple

365
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:26,602
I didn't know that.

366
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:29,211
Recognizing her beauty,

367
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,867
she was adopted as a daughter
and became a favorite of Ogosho

368
00:35:33,438 --> 00:35:35,524
As a result, She does what she wants

369
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:40,930
She is a very greedy woman

370
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:19,274
Are you back?

371
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,492
even though I have returned,

372
00:36:22,517 --> 00:36:23,828
you won't wake up?

373
00:36:23,853 --> 00:36:25,657
I feel just right at this moment

374
00:36:25,682 --> 00:36:27,086
Just leave me alone

375
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:32,617
Hey cone on, what's going on?

376
00:36:32,966 --> 00:36:35,966
Please look at my clothes

377
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,070
I was followed by a strange man

378
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:43,485
What kind of man?

379
00:36:44,032 --> 00:36:48,445
I'm glad you care about me

380
00:36:49,246 --> 00:36:50,641
Hachioji.

381
00:36:50,899 --> 00:36:51,782
Hachioji?

382
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:55,945
He's there again.

383
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:05,020
Are you really listening?

384
00:37:05,063 --> 00:37:06,180
Yes.

385
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,925
I tried to run away from him

386
00:37:09,054 --> 00:37:11,438
I'll go around the moat of the storehouse

387
00:37:11,735 --> 00:37:15,836
I finally went all the way to Shibaguchi
and just got back,

388
00:37:16,907 --> 00:37:17,945
Did you make it?

389
00:37:23,352 --> 00:37:24,969
Oh no.

390
00:37:28,626 --> 00:37:30,087
Can you do a lesson today?

391
00:37:30,631 --> 00:37:32,602
I was lazy today

392
00:37:32,688 --> 00:37:36,024
 if you keep that up, the dojo won't thrive

393
00:37:37,476 --> 00:37:39,757
Where do you put the noodles?

394
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,594
Can you put it in the strainer?

395
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,030
So why Hachobori chased you?

396
00:37:50,766 --> 00:37:52,899
It seems like he was watching a decent mansion

397
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:56,914
The lord was out with his sister.

398
00:37:57,861 --> 00:38:01,141
I thought if I just helped them out a bit,

399
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:04,633
You shouldn't do such useless things.

400
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:08,063
I wanted to be of some help

401
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:11,688
You don't have to ride on her's coattails too

402
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:17,008
The young woman went to Oku house.

403
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,016
I don't really understand what he's thinking

404
00:38:21,253 --> 00:38:22,352
Isn't it okay?

405
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:25,250
She works very hard.

406
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,906
and that doesn't sit well with me

407
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,484
It's fine that he took in and raised the daughter

408
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,102
But she is unaware

409
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:38,219
the lord hasn't done anything to owe her

410
00:38:38,553 --> 00:38:41,266
sister went to the castle as she wished.

411
00:38:41,415 --> 00:38:42,938
It's all the same either way

412
00:38:43,862 --> 00:38:44,883
Things that will continue from now on

413
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,379
Don't do something foolish

414
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:54,922
If he does that, he'll be forced to commit seppuku like my father.

415
00:38:58,876 --> 00:39:04,109
The lord is worried about you.

416
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:08,764
By the way, your body is really hot

417
00:39:46,493 --> 00:39:47,712
Come on.

418
00:39:49,518 --> 00:39:52,518
Look, what happen.

419
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:03,289
I've heard that there is a doctor

420
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,116
around here, right next door

421
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,820
Thanks.

422
00:40:24,645 --> 00:40:28,641
Today, all the doctors are off.

423
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:32,159
She is seriously ill, so please

424
00:40:32,626 --> 00:40:34,188
We'll pay.

425
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:36,555
Well then, I don't need any money

426
00:40:37,422 --> 00:40:38,718
I see.

427
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,125
A car will be prepared.

428
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,686
I kindly ask for your assistance

429
00:40:43,717 --> 00:40:47,765
Sorry, but we cannot meet your request.

430
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:51,466
You seem to be dizzy.

431
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,290
If you are like that, I don't think you can do your job.

432
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,000
There's nothing we can do

433
00:40:56,265 --> 00:40:57,435
Wait.

434
00:40:57,850 --> 00:41:00,633
If I am  drunk, Do you think I can't work?

435
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:03,549
But how can you manage if you are so drunk?

436
00:41:04,472 --> 00:41:07,664
I don't want to blame it on alcohol.

437
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:09,036
I'll take care of it

438
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:09,852
I see

439
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,555
Well then, please

440
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:14,936
Get ready

441
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,305
Then, bring a wear over the top

442
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:38,283
Currently, a doctor has come

443
00:41:54,594 --> 00:41:55,727
Come in

444
00:41:59,502 --> 00:42:02,502
Please handle her with care.

445
00:42:11,619 --> 00:42:16,481
She suddenly felt unwell while out.

446
00:42:17,714 --> 00:42:19,844
She seems to have breast pain

447
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:20,688
I see.

448
00:42:22,187 --> 00:42:23,663
Does she have a stomach ache?

449
00:42:24,485 --> 00:42:25,360
No.

450
00:42:39,867 --> 00:42:40,851
It hurts you?

451
00:43:18,185 --> 00:43:24,210
if the patient ate anything unusual
this morning?

452
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,454
Not really.

453
00:43:27,581 --> 00:43:29,492
If that's the case, Does she have tuberculosis?

454
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:31,962
If so it, ok.

455
00:43:32,758 --> 00:43:34,001
What do you think?

456
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,280
I want to talk to you alone.

457
00:43:58,596 --> 00:44:03,633
Does she have a husband?

458
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:05,467
Why you ask like that?

459
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Well, I asked something unnecessary

460
00:44:08,767 --> 00:44:11,373
Let me just offer my assessment

461
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,524
This is a celebration

462
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:16,477
In other words,She got pregnant.

463
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:28,366
What is your name?

464
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:31,573
I reside in the realm of Shiba Shinmei

465
00:44:31,598 --> 00:44:34,598
I am called the town doctor, Ryo An.

466
00:44:36,575 --> 00:44:38,383
Don't tell anyone about this.

467
00:44:39,581 --> 00:44:41,887
If you carelessly leak information to others,

468
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:44,688
it could endanger your life

469
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:50,664
doctor should never speak about their patients' matters

470
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,266
Please rest assured

471
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,357
Ogosho..Ogosho..Ogosho..

472
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:24,873
Please hurry and Ogosho...

473
00:45:35,655 --> 00:45:39,301
Ogosho,He was struck down by illness.

474
00:45:44,316 --> 00:45:47,249
Ogosho was struck down by illness.

475
00:46:18,606 --> 00:46:19,683
How's he?

476
00:46:19,708 --> 00:46:21,065
He's still not good.

477
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:32,152
lord is here.

478
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,510
In the unlikely event that the shogun remains as is,

479
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,116
No, that can't possibly be the case

480
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:29,596
Calm down

481
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:32,620
Calm down, calm down. What happens if I rush?

482
00:47:38,071 --> 00:47:38,704
What doctor say?

483
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:42,734
The doctor says it's a stomach ache

484
00:47:44,374 --> 00:47:47,851
She has a lot of worries.

485
00:47:50,187 --> 00:47:53,944
and I never imagined she would suffer from various illnesses,

486
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:58,140
If she doesn't die

487
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:05,999
If her illness continues, this house will be in a lot of chaos.

488
00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:09,383
Gohonmaru will take action

489
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,461
Echizen and Inaba will do something.

490
00:48:17,337 --> 00:48:18,172
Miyo.

491
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:26,429
Please take care of her together, you and Miyo.

492
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,555
even if the shogun were to visit.

493
00:48:30,828 --> 00:48:31,672
I see.

494
00:48:33,278 --> 00:48:39,703
If this was going to happen, I should have written her a letter of approval.

495
00:48:40,988 --> 00:48:44,453
Is he hopeless?

496
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:47,258
we must not give up hope

497
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:51,578
Is there anyone here?

498
00:48:53,469 --> 00:48:56,579
I am Tomi.

499
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:01,789
Inuchiyo just has arrived.

500
00:49:02,008 --> 00:49:03,212
I see.

501
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:22,547
She's a creepy woman

502
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:25,805
Should we kick her out of the Awaji house?

503
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,397
No, no, let's leave it as it is for a while

504
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,602
Inuchiyo.

505
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:04,383
Lord.

506
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,391
Inuchiyo has come to see you.

507
00:50:10,406 --> 00:50:11,398
Lord.

508
00:50:13,399 --> 00:50:14,898
She's Inuchiyo.

509
00:50:16,457 --> 00:50:17,492
She's Inuchiyo.

510
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:35,440
Does anyone know that you were pregnant at the castle?

511
00:50:35,755 --> 00:50:38,154
only one person know in my room.

512
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,619
There's no need to worry about it.

513
00:50:43,263 --> 00:50:47,827
It's not even been talked about in Oku yet.

514
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:51,289
The elderly people of Mukojima are also worried about this.

515
00:50:51,656 --> 00:50:55,210
Sekiou knows about us?

516
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:58,882
Just in case, I told him

517
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:04,053
Does he know I'm pregnant?

518
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:12,351
He said you should just rest at home.

519
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,154
What do you think?

520
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,497
I am very honored

521
00:51:18,638 --> 00:51:21,631
If I could do that, I would feel very relieved.

522
00:51:22,557 --> 00:51:28,271
I have an acquaintance who is a skilled doctor;

523
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,866
You can have an abortion

524
00:51:30,891 --> 00:51:33,927
Are you giving up on this child?

525
00:51:34,155 --> 00:51:37,724
You can rest there for a bit and then go home.

526
00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:41,544
Are you saying we should kill this child?

527
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:45,716
I will surely give birth

528
00:51:46,747 --> 00:51:48,262
What do you think about castles?

529
00:51:48,591 --> 00:51:51,591
I plan to quit due to illness.

530
00:51:53,592 --> 00:51:55,083
and at this age,

531
00:51:55,782 --> 00:51:58,782
I never thought I would feel this joy.

532
00:51:59,268 --> 00:52:01,302
Please let me give birth to your child

533
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:02,669
I kindly ask you

534
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:06,013
I feel that strongly
I understand your feelings,

535
00:52:06,685 --> 00:52:08,200
but how will old lord say?

536
00:52:08,701 --> 00:52:09,748
Old lord?

537
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:13,474
Okumura

538
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:20,021
You tried to get away with using me

539
00:52:20,576 --> 00:52:22,209
What are you talking about?

540
00:52:23,979 --> 00:52:25,232
It must be so

541
00:52:26,235 --> 00:52:31,677
You think Inuchiyo will be successful if he gives birth to an heir.

542
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:34,889
You are planning to abandon me

543
00:52:34,995 --> 00:52:36,772
You are over thinking.

544
00:52:37,712 --> 00:52:39,780
I truly think you are adorable

545
00:52:40,132 --> 00:52:41,327
Don't get me wrong.

546
00:52:42,374 --> 00:52:43,655
Are you sure?

547
00:52:44,123 --> 00:52:45,287
Trust me.

548
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,210
No matter what old lord say

549
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,952
Is it your child.

550
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,444
Even if I am being taken care of at the mansion,

551
00:52:57,783 --> 00:53:00,014
You have no right to give me orders.

552
00:53:01,207 --> 00:53:05,350
I will definitely give birth to this child.

553
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,068
I want to have this beautiful child

554
00:53:22,026 --> 00:53:23,171
Maruniumebachi?

555
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,975
it's an Item who wear Nishiki

556
00:53:29,598 --> 00:53:35,139
It's a luxurious item with the plum blossom
design inlaid in wood on a silver fitting

557
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,616
If we're talking about it

558
00:53:38,050 --> 00:53:39,966
it might be something from around Hongō

559
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:42,146
Actually, I felt the same way

560
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,905
The feelings of the Kaga Maeda family

561
00:53:45,116 --> 00:53:48,014
Wait a minute then

562
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:50,929
The shogun's charm
The daughter from Omiyo

563
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,803
So that's why she went to marry into the Maeda family

564
00:53:52,927 --> 00:53:56,319
So, if we speak from that angle,

565
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:00,858
it means we can also know the name of the maid and the man's family name

566
00:54:01,194 --> 00:54:02,741
Well, that's about it

567
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:07,185
She asked the local doctor to examine her.

568
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:09,616
She is really naive.

569
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:15,897
So she's trying to keep this a secret

570
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:19,116
I made a few threats.

571
00:54:19,141 --> 00:54:21,202
You managed to improve the price.

572
00:54:22,580 --> 00:54:25,335
Let this story be heard by Iimura's man

573
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,303
he'll probably jump at you with their eyes changing color

574
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,608
There's no sake.

575
00:54:32,116 --> 00:54:32,866
Ok

576
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Yes, the conversation is quite lively

577
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:47,436
Tonight, I will settle
down here

578
00:54:47,461 --> 00:54:50,452
Since the two of us have started drinking anyway,

579
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,202
let's just go with it

580
00:54:52,227 --> 00:54:55,101
When we drink, we can't stop talking.

581
00:54:55,428 --> 00:54:58,991
If only I had become a doctor who could imitate drinking without limits, I would have been more popular

582
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:00,886
That's your good point

583
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:03,530
I hope you can marry soon

584
00:55:03,710 --> 00:55:04,596
What are you talking about?

585
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,296
I've been targeting you for two years now

586
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,499
But he married with you.

587
00:55:09,971 --> 00:55:15,220
I've made up my mind not to have a wife.

588
00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:38,335
What Kikukawa say?

589
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:44,944
You blurted out unnecessary things about the root story with Kikukawa, didn't you?

590
00:55:46,343 --> 00:55:49,335
You said that Inuchiyo would be the heir.

591
00:55:51,008 --> 00:55:54,842
You tell too many secrets to other people.

592
00:55:56,390 --> 00:55:57,956
What if main house know about it?

593
00:55:59,546 --> 00:56:00,530
I’m sorry.

594
00:56:01,914 --> 00:56:06,225
I'm giving you a role

595
00:56:07,370 --> 00:56:12,389
Through Kikukawa, Don't try to relate to Miyo.

596
00:56:17,857 --> 00:56:21,530
She's definitely going to give birth to a child

597
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,936
She does not wish for promotion or involvement in local politics

598
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:30,327
You can leave the matter of Kikukawa to me,

599
00:56:31,093 --> 00:56:31,944
OK?

600
00:56:36,399 --> 00:56:42,390
as long as Kuga's side
delivers this to Hongo through the maid,

601
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:46,250
It seems like a love letter

602
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,796
Excuse me.

603
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,400
Please Give me orders

604
00:57:09,477 --> 00:57:12,960
Did you manage to send someone to Hongo?

605
00:57:13,499 --> 00:57:15,359
Yes, just before.

606
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:18,538
Received a reply from Okumura?

607
00:57:19,787 --> 00:57:22,319
but the messenger has not returned yet

608
00:57:22,614 --> 00:57:27,389
since it has been over an hour and a half....

609
00:57:28,394 --> 00:57:30,540
He will return shortly.

610
00:57:30,978 --> 00:57:33,978
Please encourage sweating by then

611
00:57:37,998 --> 00:57:39,574
Let me have it, please

612
00:57:39,886 --> 00:57:43,374
Your makeup seems to be smeared

613
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,590
Why not wash with hot water?

614
00:57:48,305 --> 00:57:51,305
Thank you very much.

615
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:54,358
I will do that.

616
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:26,171
If you need help please let me know

617
00:59:58,049 --> 00:59:59,448
Where is my dress?

618
01:00:09,135 --> 01:00:10,369
Excuse me.

619
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:20,400
I have brought a kimono for you

620
01:00:30,647 --> 01:00:32,374
That?

621
01:00:33,073 --> 01:00:33,920
Yes.

622
01:00:34,661 --> 01:00:40,805
Lord said It was more discreet to wear it.

623
01:00:41,589 --> 01:00:46,416
For a while,you should wear this.

624
01:00:47,593 --> 01:00:51,579
There is a man called Ogushio here.

625
01:01:07,866 --> 01:01:08,772
Please.

626
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:14,975
Are you here?

627
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:27,140
You have become more feminine.

628
01:01:29,537 --> 01:01:33,006
Okumura is coming?

629
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,686
He will be arriving shortly

630
01:01:35,619 --> 01:01:42,201
I'm jealous of Daizen with a woman like you.

631
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:54,850
When will the baby be born?

632
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,459
The doctor said in 3 months.

633
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,654
Did you see a doctor?

634
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,556
Surely it's not a doctor from Jochu, right?

635
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,397
He is a doctor in a town called Ryo An

636
01:02:12,147 --> 01:02:16,864
doctor in a town?
You did something careless.

637
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:21,760
He is a doctor in Shiba shinmei called Ryo An?

638
01:02:23,741 --> 01:02:24,788
It's ok.

639
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:31,162
It's a problem if a woman becomes pregnant in a house where men are not allowed.

640
01:02:32,147 --> 01:02:38,545
Do you realize this is a big problem?

641
01:04:19,071 --> 01:04:20,850
What happened?

642
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,850
You.

643
01:04:52,444 --> 01:04:53,397
Who are you guys?

644
01:05:02,812 --> 01:05:04,451
Are you alright?

645
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:09,300
my real master was next to me

646
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:11,136
I don't know who you are

647
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:11,946
I have no idea

648
01:05:12,446 --> 01:05:13,342
Are they thieves?

649
01:05:14,115 --> 01:05:15,517
I think they are different.

650
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,837
What on earth are they?

651
01:05:20,830 --> 01:05:22,885
Were you saved?

652
01:06:10,355 --> 01:06:14,385
Master, let me get in

653
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,136
My boss has caught

654
01:06:20,315 --> 01:06:21,362
Ryoan?

655
01:06:22,045 --> 01:06:25,045
He just received the order

656
01:06:25,078 --> 01:06:26,164
but because of night

657
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:29,611
I was told to follow him just in case

658
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:36,873
However, halfway there, he was surrounded by 5,6 samurai,
and he was taken straight to a large mansion in Mukojima

659
01:06:37,225 --> 01:06:38,014
House in Oki?

660
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:42,927
My boss told me to let you know if anything happens to him.

661
01:06:44,678 --> 01:06:46,287
They must be the people who came to this house last night.

662
01:06:51,150 --> 01:06:54,150
Is something wrong with the neighbor?

663
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:55,441
It seems he was attacked again

664
01:06:55,622 --> 01:06:56,758
I'll be right back

665
01:06:56,783 --> 01:06:57,263
Where?

666
01:06:57,521 --> 01:06:58,247
Mukoujima.

667
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,091
Did she have a forced suicide?

668
01:07:29,309 --> 01:07:31,745
She was dumped by a man, they say.

669
01:07:31,882 --> 01:07:33,276
She's stupid

670
01:07:33,586 --> 01:07:36,235
She's beautiful. what a waste.

671
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:53,948
from that back gate.

672
01:07:55,450 --> 01:07:57,230
This is the Nakano sekiou mansion.

673
01:07:59,073 --> 01:08:00,349
I see, that makes sense

674
01:08:00,536 --> 01:08:02,456
My boss should be safe?

675
01:08:03,509 --> 01:08:04,762
but it might be too late

676
01:08:06,283 --> 01:08:08,631
He should not have examined her.

677
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,421
What should I do?

678
01:08:11,460 --> 01:08:13,072
Don't go home first

679
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:16,900
Please let Toyoharu know that I might be late

680
01:10:47,331 --> 01:10:48,231
Uemochi

681
01:10:49,217 --> 01:10:50,210
who?

682
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:57,090
Hold on.

683
01:11:01,769 --> 01:11:02,575
Wait!

684
01:11:04,339 --> 01:11:05,032
who?

685
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,149
I apologize for intruding without permission,

686
01:11:07,174 --> 01:11:09,000
I wanna see your garden.

687
01:11:09,089 --> 01:11:10,457
Without any notice, How did you get here?

688
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,821
Nakano Sekiou's garden is awesome.

689
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:17,285
I've always wanted to see here.

690
01:11:18,162 --> 01:11:20,388
I believe it is a place where one cannot expect anything even if one asks properly,

691
01:11:20,837 --> 01:11:22,554
How did you get here?

692
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:25,462
What a nice garden.

693
01:11:27,189 --> 01:11:28,812
It's awesome.

694
01:11:34,250 --> 01:11:35,843
Catch him

695
01:11:37,278 --> 01:11:38,498
There is an intruder.

696
01:11:38,835 --> 01:11:40,555
Where?

697
01:11:42,241 --> 01:11:43,994
Light up

698
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:49,661
Something suspicious has sneaked in

699
01:11:49,768 --> 01:11:50,368
How many?

700
01:11:50,622 --> 01:11:51,651
One person

701
01:11:51,732 --> 01:11:52,419
One person?

702
01:11:53,149 --> 01:11:54,536
He must has been investigating a doctor

703
01:11:55,175 --> 01:11:57,288
Alright, capture him.

704
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:32,504
I caught him, so please come quickly

705
01:13:18,126 --> 01:13:19,626
I'm sorry for being late

706
01:13:21,742 --> 01:13:24,742
I heard that a drowned body was found.

707
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,541
who are you?

708
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:28,929
I'm curious about it.

709
01:13:29,129 --> 01:13:31,833
She was a woman of 26,7 years old, she was pregnant

710
01:13:32,817 --> 01:13:33,944
she was pregnant?

711
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,590
The allowance for Collection of drowned bodies will be submitted all at once tomorrow morning

712
01:13:43,739 --> 01:13:45,146
Thank you very much.

713
01:13:45,573 --> 01:13:49,828
It seems that he has something to do with the drowned bodies.

714
01:13:51,368 --> 01:13:52,368
What can I do for you?

715
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:55,921
Did you find out about the identity?

716
01:13:56,236 --> 01:13:58,519
It was handed over to the person who came to pick it up

717
01:13:59,110 --> 01:13:59,980
Which one was picked up?

718
01:14:00,503 --> 01:14:03,951
The magistrate's office took over.

719
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:06,410
It was taken by the magistrate's office?

720
01:14:06,504 --> 01:14:06,998
Yes.

721
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:11,058
It was taken by the magistrate's office...

722
01:14:22,805 --> 01:14:25,805
Mr. Shinnosuke is here

723
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:28,830
What's going on with Shinnosuke?

724
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:38,488
Rokubei, it's rare to see you.

725
01:14:38,742 --> 01:14:40,102
How are you doing?

726
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:46,566
Shinnosuke, please wait a moment until I finish writing this

727
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:48,996
Take your time

728
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:53,356
I have only brought something that I think
will please you.

729
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:54,721
and then I will take my leave

730
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,646
What's that?

731
01:14:57,670 --> 01:14:59,076
Please finish it.

732
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,276
I would like to see that item first

733
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:01,925
What's that?

734
01:15:05,425 --> 01:15:06,081
Here

735
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,425
What's wrong with this?

736
01:15:18,932 --> 01:15:20,885
Is this the first time you've met with Ofumi?

737
01:15:21,972 --> 01:15:22,456
Yes.

738
01:15:23,850 --> 01:15:25,924
She's Fumi, my younger sister

739
01:15:27,533 --> 01:15:29,297
This is Shinnosuke

740
01:15:30,336 --> 01:15:34,313
I am a small trader, but I am also
allowed to come and go to the castle

741
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:36,708
We will wait there.

742
01:15:37,256 --> 01:15:38,383
Please.

743
01:15:49,619 --> 01:15:51,532
I haven't seen Shinnosuke for a while,

744
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,186
but he looks good

745
01:15:53,210 --> 01:15:55,218
He's always easygoing

746
01:15:55,893 --> 01:15:59,499
or perhaps it's about who the owner is

747
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:01,722
Wait a minute

748
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:05,057
The letter has just been delivered

749
01:16:05,446 --> 01:16:06,745
According to the document

750
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:12,020
there was a man called Kikukawa a few days ago

751
01:16:12,520 --> 01:16:17,065
It is said that he requested a
lodging at Myosenji Temple in Azabu

752
01:16:17,713 --> 01:16:18,897
Myosenji Temple

753
01:16:19,698 --> 01:16:20,171
Yes,that's it.

754
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:21,941
This is the temple that Ryoan mentioned

755
01:16:22,881 --> 01:16:26,537
That's the Kikukawa that got pregnant.

756
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,856
So, to erase that secret,

757
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:30,276
did they attack Ryo An?

758
01:16:30,300 --> 01:16:31,996
It could be.

759
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:36,280
Is the drowned person Kikugawa?

760
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:37,917
No, I really don't understand anything

761
01:16:38,370 --> 01:16:40,006
They say the magistrate's office has taken it over

762
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:40,945
 magistrate's office?

763
01:16:43,190 --> 01:16:46,626
I will visit Wakizaka tomorrow

764
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:48,186
and show this

765
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:49,876
Well then, I will take my leave

766
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:50,938
Stay here.

767
01:16:51,999 --> 01:16:53,155
When I think about Ryo An

768
01:16:53,180 --> 01:16:54,191
I can't stay here

769
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,040
Is he alive or dead?

770
01:16:58,783 --> 01:17:01,737
You helped me by
jumping

771
01:17:02,422 --> 01:17:04,636
You are always complaining.

772
01:17:04,836 --> 01:17:09,548
I am just concerned about Ryu-an's well-being out of neighborly kindness

773
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:30,268
; how long has this been off?

774
01:17:30,859 --> 01:17:32,532
It is 8.7.

775
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:36,850
I hope this flower decoration is wisteria,

776
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,976
but you don't really like the peony?

777
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:44,836
Shino was at the recent meeting with the Oyato
family After seeing the Fujimusume from Fukushima,

778
01:17:45,479 --> 01:17:47,225
I can't find any peace unless it's at Fuji

779
01:17:48,461 --> 01:17:50,247
I didn't know about that.

780
01:18:00,870 --> 01:18:02,130
Fum is thriving.

781
01:18:02,630 --> 01:18:04,290
Otomi

782
01:18:05,121 --> 01:18:07,241
I've read this

783
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:10,850
Is there any other supreme and unusual book?

784
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:12,993
Let me see.

785
01:18:14,933 --> 01:18:17,433
How about this one?

786
01:18:18,010 --> 01:18:19,547
This is about retaliation?

787
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:22,131
Yes.
a woman's revenge on her enemies

788
01:18:24,259 --> 01:18:27,366
This sounds fun.

789
01:18:28,409 --> 01:18:29,443
Let me borrow this.

790
01:18:30,060 --> 01:18:31,656
Please take your time

791
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:34,406
Please lend me something too.

792
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:37,720
Yes, yes, please take a look

793
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,112
What are you doing?

794
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:39,559
The text you read
comes from where?

795
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:44,166
I know your very important secret

796
01:19:48,380 --> 01:19:51,380
I am the Ochiai Kyudo

797
01:19:52,322 --> 01:19:54,337
I have been wanting to talk to you once

798
01:19:55,783 --> 01:19:57,256
What can I do for you?

799
01:19:57,742 --> 01:20:00,038
I will show you your secret

800
01:20:00,410 --> 01:20:01,855
Can you come there?

801
01:20:03,762 --> 01:20:07,667
If you take a look,
you will know that the item is right there

802
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:12,190
before anyone notices, please go.

803
01:21:15,838 --> 01:21:16,628
Oh

804
01:21:24,230 --> 01:21:26,902
I believe you've seen this before.

805
01:21:27,824 --> 01:21:29,785
I've never seen this before.

806
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:30,800
No?

807
01:21:31,193 --> 01:21:34,193
I have no idea at all

808
01:21:34,750 --> 01:21:36,456
Not known to you?

809
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:38,699
I see.

810
01:21:40,569 --> 01:21:44,027
If you don't know, there is no choice.

811
01:21:45,082 --> 01:21:47,324
I'll take it somewhere.

812
01:21:50,355 --> 01:21:51,515
Don't do that.

813
01:21:52,428 --> 01:21:56,332
This step was painted with lou.

814
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:01,997
It is a stepping chair that someone offered on the day of the cherry blossom viewing

815
01:22:04,606 --> 01:22:07,606
there will be nothing left to hide

816
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:13,643
I have kept this hidden here until today

817
01:22:15,729 --> 01:22:18,729
Do you understand my feeling?

818
01:22:21,091 --> 01:22:26,425
If there is anything I can do for you
from now on,let me know

819
01:22:27,537 --> 01:22:31,486
and I promise to be of help to you

820
01:22:35,370 --> 01:22:37,426
Mr. Ochiai

821
01:22:37,608 --> 01:22:39,228
I need the stepping chair

822
01:22:39,722 --> 01:22:42,722
Are you asking me to hand over that?

823
01:22:43,570 --> 01:22:45,186
I can give it to you,

824
01:22:45,216 --> 01:22:47,829
But it depends on what you do.

825
01:22:47,854 --> 01:22:49,860
Please meet him one more time

826
01:22:50,116 --> 01:22:54,893
I will definitely hand it over at that time

827
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:00,046
It's a notice for the afternoon

828
01:23:00,070 --> 01:23:01,966
It's already early, so go ahead

829
01:23:22,451 --> 01:23:24,231
Shogun's residence have just returned.

830
01:23:25,150 --> 01:23:29,480
Did you tell the General about it?

831
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:31,816
Through the deity of Inaba

832
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:36,125
I mentioned that he should not take the chopsticks in front of the person.

833
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:40,550
but just to be sure, let me convey it once more

834
01:23:49,570 --> 01:23:53,832
I hope it will work well.

835
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:32,703
He either uses chopsticks or he doesn't.

836
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:38,789
If he uses chopsticks, the plan fails.

837
01:24:51,000 --> 01:25:01,320
I hope you will recover soon.

838
01:25:03,809 --> 01:25:08,278
Aren't you going to start with the chopsticks?

839
01:25:08,851 --> 01:25:13,038
Thank you for your hospitality, even if I don't eat.

840
01:25:14,033 --> 01:25:17,033
Please take care

841
01:25:17,796 --> 01:25:19,540
I would like to leave

842
01:25:43,136 --> 01:25:44,723
Mino.

843
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:55,869
Why didn't he use chopsticks?

844
01:25:57,284 --> 01:25:58,217
Tell me.

845
01:26:00,876 --> 01:26:05,153
Please Forgive me....

846
01:26:07,256 --> 01:26:08,243
Tell me.

847
01:26:10,593 --> 01:26:11,719
Tell me.

848
01:26:14,133 --> 01:26:21,563
He didn't eat it because he was wary that it was toxic.

849
01:26:21,594 --> 01:26:26,684
perhaps poison may be mixed in,

850
01:26:27,663 --> 01:26:28,730
What?

851
01:26:29,796 --> 01:26:31,729
poison may be mixed in?

852
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:37,439
Are you sure?

853
01:26:37,573 --> 01:26:39,346
I'm sure

854
01:26:41,541 --> 01:26:42,687
Mino

855
01:26:43,612 --> 01:26:48,392
Shogun wanna kill me?

856
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,754
I'm sorry

857
01:26:52,830 --> 01:26:59,210
Bring paper and ink

858
01:27:03,741 --> 01:27:06,561
I got approval from old lord

859
01:27:07,206 --> 01:27:08,720
He wrote?

860
01:27:24,761 --> 01:27:26,514
No one come

861
01:27:34,766 --> 01:27:36,266
How was it?

862
01:27:36,397 --> 01:27:41,155
It seems that yesterday, about three elderly people were brought.

863
01:27:41,616 --> 01:27:43,997
Perhaps one of them was my boss.

864
01:27:44,166 --> 01:27:46,334
Ryo An was not included.

865
01:27:46,376 --> 01:27:48,245
He might be still in the house.

866
01:27:48,403 --> 01:27:50,090
I don't know if he's alive.

867
01:27:51,643 --> 01:27:54,643
Yasuke-san, let's go to Kozukappa

868
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,197
Please wait a moment

869
01:28:02,162 --> 01:28:04,546
You mentioned something that cannot be ignored

870
01:28:04,721 --> 01:28:05,301
Who are you?

871
01:28:05,599 --> 01:28:06,812
Are you local here?

872
01:28:07,826 --> 01:28:10,386
What were you guys talking about?

873
01:28:11,253 --> 01:28:13,573
We must have met somewhere

874
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,675
I don't know

875
01:28:15,179 --> 01:28:16,219
What were you guys talking about?

876
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:18,276
We must have met somewhere

877
01:28:19,421 --> 01:28:20,547
Where was it?

878
01:28:23,781 --> 01:28:26,508
That's right, let me hear your name

879
01:28:26,887 --> 01:28:29,887
My name is Mizukake Nigenosuke.

880
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:31,813
You're rude.

881
01:28:33,689 --> 01:28:35,935
I need to ask you something.
Come with me.

882
01:28:36,138 --> 01:28:36,971
Sorry

883
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:39,046
I am also quite busy

884
01:28:39,070 --> 01:28:41,465
I will give you a punishment

885
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:44,003
For what reason?

886
01:28:44,394 --> 01:28:46,188
I have the right to ask.

887
01:28:46,955 --> 01:28:48,874
You make quibbles.

888
01:28:49,749 --> 01:28:52,749
There is more than enough water in the moat,

889
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:55,701
but unfortunately, there is no ladle, so there's nothing to be done

890
01:28:56,469 --> 01:28:58,569
You bastard!

891
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,263
This must be a house with a small pillar

892
01:29:20,163 --> 01:29:21,163
Yes

893
01:29:21,569 --> 01:29:22,596
Where's your boss?

894
01:29:22,775 --> 01:29:25,775
Don't you understand?
He's not here.

895
01:29:27,589 --> 01:29:28,509
What can I do for you?

896
01:29:29,186 --> 01:29:30,603
I need to ask you something.

897
01:29:34,039 --> 01:29:34,866
What is it?

898
01:29:46,253 --> 01:29:48,210
Are you a woman?

899
01:29:49,401 --> 01:29:52,431
What's the hell?
What can I do for you?

900
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:55,429
Actually, it's someone I know

901
01:29:56,333 --> 01:29:58,758
I think he was brought here and buried

902
01:29:59,623 --> 01:30:02,623
Man or woman?

903
01:30:03,185 --> 01:30:04,571
He's 51 years old,local doctor

904
01:30:05,654 --> 01:30:07,047
I have no idea.

905
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:08,870
Ask my dad.

906
01:30:09,392 --> 01:30:10,397
He'll be back eventually

907
01:30:13,410 --> 01:30:16,971
Oseki-san!
My clothes is ready?

908
01:30:24,527 --> 01:30:26,487
They are in shadow

909
01:30:26,621 --> 01:30:27,488
Not yet?

910
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:53,220
Don't touch it.

911
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:55,697
It was worn by a drowned woman.

912
01:30:56,226 --> 01:31:00,113
Is this the kimono worn by a pregnant woman brought from the magistrate's office?

913
01:31:00,779 --> 01:31:02,928
That's right.
How did you know?

914
01:31:03,494 --> 01:31:06,454
She was carried here.

915
01:31:07,570 --> 01:31:11,735
She was age 27,8 beautiful women.
we buried her with Oseki-san.

916
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:14,405
Would you sell me that kimono?

917
01:31:15,004 --> 01:31:15,844
That?

918
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:17,350
I'm willing to pay whatever price you ask

919
01:31:19,643 --> 01:31:21,196
If you buy that belt, I'll sell it.

920
01:31:21,594 --> 01:31:22,420
OK,Oseki?

921
01:31:23,495 --> 01:31:24,680
It's not mine.

922
01:31:40,692 --> 01:31:43,308
Sorry to call you out on such short notice.

923
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:48,081
Wish you guys could have seen this sooner.

924
01:31:48,599 --> 01:31:49,346
Please

925
01:31:49,554 --> 01:31:52,554
We kindly appreciate it.

926
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:54,533
Please take a look.

927
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:16,033
Have you nominated Inuchiyo as your successor?

928
01:32:16,623 --> 01:32:22,078
Old lord approved it at Nishinomaru Oku today.

929
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:26,870
I'm sure your hardships were immeasurable.

930
01:32:27,406 --> 01:32:31,324
My efforts have been worth it

931
01:32:32,689 --> 01:32:35,689
Each of you should first feel relieved

932
01:32:38,283 --> 01:32:43,934
With this we have nothing to fear from the original family.

933
01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:51,893
If approved by the Old lord, the Shoguns cannot go against it.

934
01:32:52,599 --> 01:32:55,609
But there is no relief yet.

935
01:32:56,546 --> 01:32:59,546
I am aware that any enemy may appear from anywhere

936
01:33:00,072 --> 01:33:00,905
We know.

937
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:06,186
Then let us celebrate this day by coming together for a moment

938
01:33:50,808 --> 01:33:55,479
My successor is....

939
01:33:55,572 --> 01:33:57,688
It was decided

940
01:33:58,426 --> 01:34:02,034
Inuchiyo will be adopted a child

941
01:34:04,323 --> 01:34:11,516
When she comes of age she will be a general.

942
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:38,065
What?
That is...

943
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:04,040
Who did something like this?

944
01:35:09,177 --> 01:35:11,029
Who's the hell?

945
01:35:14,678 --> 01:35:17,678
It seems even you was surprised by that kimono

946
01:35:19,568 --> 01:35:20,646
What?

947
01:35:22,890 --> 01:35:25,890
Well, that's because it's a kimono that was put on Kikugawa

948
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:32,866
Poor thing

949
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:36,146
Kikukawa's body was moved from the magistrate's office.

950
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:40,580
She was treated like a fool, buried in a hole like a dog or cat,

951
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:45,270
The kimono and belt are returned to you.

952
01:35:47,826 --> 01:35:48,959
Who's the hell?

953
01:35:50,231 --> 01:35:51,677
Come on.

954
01:35:52,333 --> 01:35:55,333
Be quiet and listen to me.

955
01:35:57,185 --> 01:35:58,037
Come on.

956
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:02,232
Sekiou

957
01:36:03,028 --> 01:36:04,600
Did you kill the town doctor,Ryo An?

958
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:08,929
Is he still alive?

959
01:36:10,959 --> 01:36:14,864
There's an intruder here.

960
01:36:15,169 --> 01:36:17,708
You look so evil

961
01:36:18,373 --> 01:36:19,654
Who's the hell?

962
01:36:21,302 --> 01:36:22,302
Tell me your name.

963
01:36:24,133 --> 01:36:25,192
Dakatsunone.

964
01:36:35,050 --> 01:36:36,326
Let the endorsement speak for itself; indeed,

965
01:36:36,951 --> 01:36:39,067
You were trying to control it with the approval of the Ogosho.

966
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:43,396
Some people don't agree with that.

967
01:36:43,420 --> 01:36:45,458
Is anyone there?

968
01:37:27,555 --> 01:37:30,555
The legacy of the Shimada family.
Did you see it?

969
01:38:07,271 --> 01:38:09,146
Get after him.

970
01:38:14,045 --> 01:38:15,599
Capture him.

971
01:38:34,349 --> 01:38:35,498
Damn it.

972
01:38:41,959 --> 01:38:44,295
Capture him.

973
01:38:45,020 --> 01:38:51,935
The back of the north was open, and so he was the north back gate

974
01:39:16,123 --> 01:39:17,896
This music is good

975
01:39:19,795 --> 01:39:24,880
I am praying for the recovery of your lord's illness

976
01:40:16,153 --> 01:40:19,153
You came to get the stepping chair, didn't you?

977
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,876
I thought you would definitely come,

978
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,900
but I won't keep it in the same place forever

979
01:40:30,590 --> 01:40:33,036
Anyway, I waited

980
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:35,656
I wondered how I could meet you

981
01:40:35,680 --> 01:40:37,849
I was so consumed by that,

982
01:40:38,630 --> 01:40:41,630
but you have come to an end

983
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:44,028
Were you waiting that long to meet me?

984
01:40:45,139 --> 01:40:47,005
Are you sure?

985
01:40:47,700 --> 01:40:51,194
I don't need to lie

986
01:40:52,594 --> 01:40:56,762
I can do anything for you

987
01:40:57,097 --> 01:40:58,614
So come on.

988
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:00,209
What are you going to do with me?

989
01:41:00,287 --> 01:41:01,709
Still don't know how I feel?

990
01:41:06,240 --> 01:41:10,521
If what you say is true,

991
01:41:11,900 --> 01:41:13,794
please show me the evidence

992
01:41:13,819 --> 01:41:14,739
What?

993
01:41:14,937 --> 01:41:17,937
Yes, if I understand that,

994
01:41:20,546 --> 01:41:22,872
I will follow your heart

995
01:41:22,897 --> 01:41:24,998
What's that?

996
01:41:25,716 --> 01:41:30,864
The other day, Ochiai-san told me to consult him about anything.

997
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:31,927
I see

998
01:41:32,810 --> 01:41:34,596
I have a request

999
01:41:34,677 --> 01:41:36,052
What's that?

1000
01:41:36,604 --> 01:41:42,724
Mr. Ochiai always accompanies the maid
when visiting the temple

1001
01:41:44,310 --> 01:41:47,310
You have also made a stepping stone to the temple

1002
01:41:50,530 --> 01:41:51,911
You are the truth

1003
01:41:52,466 --> 01:41:54,778
If you can see the truth in me,

1004
01:41:56,820 --> 01:41:58,911
please show the letter in that manner

1005
01:41:59,232 --> 01:42:00,263
show the letter?

1006
01:42:03,230 --> 01:42:07,380
I would like to read such
a sentence once

1007
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,880
Do you want something like that?

1008
01:42:11,905 --> 01:42:14,075
I will show it to you

1009
01:42:16,633 --> 01:42:18,505
Promise me

1010
01:42:19,163 --> 01:42:23,427
Please fulfill my request instead.

1011
01:42:24,966 --> 01:42:25,935
This is not good idea.

1012
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:28,162
I can't hold back.

1013
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:35,584
This is not good idea.

1014
01:42:37,275 --> 01:42:38,291
Please

1015
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:59,560
What happened to the real thing?

1016
01:43:01,466 --> 01:43:04,279
What's wrong?

1017
01:43:05,418 --> 01:43:07,472
The way these tiles are stacked is bad.

1018
01:43:08,052 --> 01:43:09,177
This method gets someone hurt.

1019
01:43:15,810 --> 01:43:17,766
It's over there

1020
01:43:17,791 --> 01:43:19,685
Climb that peace and into the garden

1021
01:43:23,397 --> 01:43:25,843
Did you hear any sounds of fighting inside?

1022
01:43:25,868 --> 01:43:28,185
He said I had going home first.

1023
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,771
Oh my god.

1024
01:43:30,290 --> 01:43:31,906
I don't know if they are here or not

1025
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:33,872
I can't call out loud

1026
01:43:36,074 --> 01:43:38,138
Yasuke, Run!

1027
01:43:39,599 --> 01:43:41,568
Hold on.

1028
01:43:43,193 --> 01:43:44,177
Capture him.

1029
01:43:47,451 --> 01:43:48,943
She is very suspicious.

1030
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:58,919
We have procured such women.

1031
01:43:59,326 --> 01:44:00,802
What a nice.

1032
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:02,106
Where did you bring her from?

1033
01:44:02,131 --> 01:44:05,475
She was at the back east gate, so we caught her.

1034
01:44:05,682 --> 01:44:08,682
What kind of woman are you?

1035
01:44:10,225 --> 01:44:13,225
Why did you observe this mansion?

1036
01:44:13,250 --> 01:44:14,380
I did not observe it

1037
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,591
You're lying.

1038
01:44:17,265 --> 01:44:19,051
There was one more man,

1039
01:44:19,185 --> 01:44:20,325
but I let him slip away

1040
01:44:20,350 --> 01:44:23,350
Do you understand that this is Nakano sekiou lord's mansion?

1041
01:44:25,617 --> 01:44:26,963
I have no knowledge of such things

1042
01:44:27,480 --> 01:44:30,480
To be honest, We will get you naked.

1043
01:44:31,107 --> 01:44:33,028
I didn't stepped into the mansion

1044
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,528
but why do you have to capture me just for walking outside?

1045
01:44:36,553 --> 01:44:37,920
We suspect you.

1046
01:44:38,240 --> 01:44:39,420
What kind of woman are you?

1047
01:44:39,785 --> 01:44:41,224
You don't seem like an amateur

1048
01:44:43,943 --> 01:44:49,263
You can use me however you like.

1049
01:44:49,292 --> 01:44:50,896
She seems like an interesting woman

1050
01:44:50,921 --> 01:44:51,795
What kind of woman are you?

1051
01:44:52,821 --> 01:44:54,357
I'm teaching singing

1052
01:44:54,951 --> 01:44:55,959
Are you?

1053
01:44:56,160 --> 01:44:57,441
Are you a singing teacher?

1054
01:44:57,513 --> 01:44:59,771
You seem like that kind of person

1055
01:45:00,182 --> 01:45:02,078
Can you sing?

1056
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:02,923
Try singing there

1057
01:45:03,866 --> 01:45:06,688
My song can't be sung without a shamisen

1058
01:45:07,120 --> 01:45:09,281
Don't be greedy

1059
01:45:10,929 --> 01:45:13,224
You are always trying to act clever,

1060
01:45:13,690 --> 01:45:15,595
but you are really nothing special

1061
01:45:16,340 --> 01:45:18,558
What did you do with the woman's corpse?

1062
01:45:19,149 --> 01:45:20,756
We will take care of it shorty

1063
01:45:20,822 --> 01:45:21,869
Shut up!

1064
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:23,783
Look at that.

1065
01:45:26,910 --> 01:45:30,597
Why is the discarded kimono with the belt?

1066
01:45:30,961 --> 01:45:31,748
You bastard!

1067
01:45:33,121 --> 01:45:34,745
Did you kill the town doctor?

1068
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:39,908
We have buried him in the the Ushigome.

1069
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:45,739
Last night, someone sneaked here.

1070
01:45:47,190 --> 01:45:51,540
Daizen, those subordinates of your are completely useless

1071
01:45:52,546 --> 01:45:55,412
They can't even catch one.

1072
01:46:28,810 --> 01:46:30,911
Sing quieter.

1073
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,779
Don't be loud.

1074
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,107
What's wrong?

1075
01:47:11,396 --> 01:47:12,599
I’m sorry.

1076
01:47:14,654 --> 01:47:15,779
Hold on.

1077
01:47:53,614 --> 01:47:56,051
What a awesome.

1078
01:47:56,076 --> 01:47:57,615
She looks just like a certain person.

1079
01:47:59,714 --> 01:48:02,714
Bring her to Hanare.

1080
01:48:03,045 --> 01:48:03,576
Yes.

1081
01:48:06,520 --> 01:48:08,708
Forgive her.

1082
01:48:23,997 --> 01:48:24,864
Okumura

1083
01:48:25,466 --> 01:48:26,045
What?

1084
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:27,505
That woman...

1085
01:48:27,693 --> 01:48:29,130
Do you know her?

1086
01:48:44,115 --> 01:48:45,552
Excuse me.

1087
01:48:48,317 --> 01:48:49,224
Get on your knee.

1088
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:52,365
She.

1089
01:48:55,224 --> 01:48:59,255
She is indeed a creature of the same hole

1090
01:49:00,352 --> 01:49:02,724
What's your name?

1091
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:06,787
I'm Haru.

1092
01:49:08,760 --> 01:49:10,786
Do you have any brothers?

1093
01:49:12,018 --> 01:49:13,372
Do you have a  younger sister?

1094
01:49:17,349 --> 01:49:18,357
No.

1095
01:49:20,084 --> 01:49:20,787
No?

1096
01:49:22,224 --> 01:49:22,795
No.

1097
01:49:23,724 --> 01:49:25,529
You are lying.

1098
01:49:26,709 --> 01:49:27,201
Daizen.

1099
01:49:28,238 --> 01:49:30,646
Let Shimomura-san deal with this woman.

1100
01:49:31,970 --> 01:49:34,161
Tell him to be strict.

1101
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:35,419
I get it.

1102
01:49:38,930 --> 01:49:42,388
Ogosho is about to die

1103
01:49:42,825 --> 01:49:44,341
Really?

1104
01:49:44,496 --> 01:49:47,496
Hayashi is here now.

1105
01:50:10,513 --> 01:50:14,110
Is he getting die?

1106
01:50:14,177 --> 01:50:17,053
Please get ready

1107
01:50:17,282 --> 01:50:18,655
I get it.

1108
01:50:20,092 --> 01:50:33,772
If he dies, read that his approval in front of all of you.

1109
01:50:34,468 --> 01:50:35,348
Please

1110
01:50:35,915 --> 01:50:37,101
I get it.

1111
01:50:42,641 --> 01:50:43,554
Wait

1112
01:50:49,550 --> 01:50:51,065
Do you really think you can escape?

1113
01:50:51,657 --> 01:50:56,122
This woman should be dealt with severely.

1114
01:50:58,411 --> 01:51:02,771
You are going to die here

1115
01:51:03,518 --> 01:51:04,974
Kill her.

1116
01:51:06,757 --> 01:51:07,958
Stay down.

1117
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,749
Capture him

1118
01:51:31,749 --> 01:51:32,445
You.

1119
01:51:32,624 --> 01:51:34,569
Why you are here?

1120
01:51:34,819 --> 01:51:37,819
I'm worried because you didn't come back

1121
01:51:38,010 --> 01:51:41,425
I knew it, You were Sekiou's subordinate.

1122
01:51:54,882 --> 01:51:56,023
Don't worry about me, just run away

1123
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:57,460
How about you?

1124
01:51:58,038 --> 01:51:59,132
Don't worry

1125
01:52:00,904 --> 01:52:03,921
Go to your uncle's house

1126
01:52:04,491 --> 01:52:05,468
Yes.

1127
01:52:28,616 --> 01:52:29,640
You.

1128
01:52:30,048 --> 01:52:30,975
Don't worry

1129
01:52:39,288 --> 01:52:40,148
Will you run away?

1130
01:52:40,546 --> 01:52:42,320
I won't run away today

1131
01:52:43,690 --> 01:52:45,382
I feel different than I did yesterday

1132
01:52:46,938 --> 01:52:52,639
I will reveal all your secrets

1133
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:55,259
Just bring it.

1134
01:53:59,761 --> 01:54:02,342
You are disrespectful.
This is the Lord's approval.

1135
01:54:02,702 --> 01:54:04,155
What?
His approval?

1136
01:54:16,210 --> 01:54:17,741
What are you going to do?

1137
01:54:47,315 --> 01:54:49,186
Don't ever give him that letter of approval.

1138
01:54:56,312 --> 01:54:57,765
Come on.

1139
01:56:11,762 --> 01:56:14,762
His sword skills were very effective.

1140
01:56:15,445 --> 01:56:19,257
He finally got the Lord's letter of approval.

1141
01:56:19,859 --> 01:56:23,804
The approval letter left Sekiou's hands.

1142
01:56:24,875 --> 01:56:29,265
Will Shinnosuke take away that certificate?

1143
01:56:30,250 --> 01:56:33,195
Or Sekiou will take it back.

1144
01:56:34,146 --> 01:56:40,445
This document of approval would have a major influence on the shogunate's political course.

1145
01:56:41,436 --> 01:56:47,716
Meanwhile, In Edo Castle, is adding to the great elder's critical condition.

1146
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:19,843
THE END

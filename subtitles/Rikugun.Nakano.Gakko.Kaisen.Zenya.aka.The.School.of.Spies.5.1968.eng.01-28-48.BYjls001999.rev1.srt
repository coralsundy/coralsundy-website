School of Spies 5 (Final Episode of Series): 
The Night Before The War
(Old Title: War Broke Out Last Night)

3
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,915
November 1941

4
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:36,509
Japan was in a stalemate due to the war on mainland China

5
00:00:37,056 --> 00:00:44,098
I left Japan, which wasn't working at the US-Japan talks

6
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:48,942
I was headed to Hong Kong for a top secret mission.

7
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,908
Were you followed?

8
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:10,798
Maybe it’s the minion of the B agency.

9
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:18,086
There are US and British intelligence agencies operating in Hong Kong

10
00:02:21,089 --> 00:02:29,850
They are marking the Japanese here because the US-Japan negotiations are not going well

11
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,978
He's coming

12
00:02:37,634 --> 00:02:41,262
Thank you for your hard work.
I'll introduce him

13
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:45,067
He is Isomura from the Hong Kong branch of Yamato Bussan

14
00:02:45,224 --> 00:02:47,043
He is a navy intelligence officer

15
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,732
He is Mr. Shiina I explained to you

16
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,485
I'm Shiina.
Nice to meet you

17
00:02:52,559 --> 00:02:54,256
Have a seat

18
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:02,280
I got him to collect a lot of information for you

19
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,885
I want to help him

20
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:11,855
He is Lieutenant Colonel Dalek, who is stationed in Murray this time.

21
00:03:13,296 --> 00:03:15,394
He chairs the next meeting

22
00:03:17,336 --> 00:03:24,501
He will stay in Room 443 of the Plaza Hotel by 3 days

23
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:31,543
He reserves the innermost room on the 4th floor

24
00:03:32,436 --> 00:03:37,436
Your room is room 424.
There is an emergency staircase nearby just in case

25
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:46,996
American and British staff gathered here for 5 days from November 5th

26
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:57,517
Asian Defense Liaison Conference to be held in Hong Kong

27
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:02,422
The next day I went to the Stand Plaza Hotel

28
00:04:03,381 --> 00:04:13,860
My mission is to steal the confidential information that will be decided at this meeting.

29
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:21,865
Hi

30
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:27,445
I brought Masako, the daughter of the branch manager

31
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:30,425
She is the grandson of Dr. Okada

32
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:37,501
She is Masako's friend actress Ichinose

33
00:04:38,003 --> 00:04:40,068
Good evening.
Nice to meet you

34
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:42,512
I'm Shiina
Nice to meet you

35
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,862
What do you want to drink?

36
00:04:50,287 --> 00:04:51,727
I'll have wine

37
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:53,680
I want to dance

38
00:04:53,847 --> 00:04:55,142
I'm afraid

39
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,010
Let's dance,Akiko

40
00:04:58,836 --> 00:05:00,131
Serve us a wine

41
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:05,759
They are very good fiancées

42
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,617
Are they engaged?

43
00:05:09,085 --> 00:05:11,340
They are best friends since college

44
00:05:11,753 --> 00:05:13,025
You didn't know?

45
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,313
He didn't tell me

46
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:20,447
They seem to decide the date of the wedding

47
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:26,478
Let's have a festive party with four people in the near future

48
00:05:26,612 --> 00:05:29,904
We should tease them

49
00:05:33,647 --> 00:05:36,024
What a nice view

50
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:45,567
When will you return to japan?

51
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:49,997
I really want to stay for about a week, but our office doesn't have the money

52
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:57,174
If you stay at a hotel exclusively for Japanese people, you can stay for twice as many days with the same budget.

53
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:02,029
I wanted to stay longer if I knew I could meet you

54
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:13,534
Our wine is here

55
00:06:39,271 --> 00:06:47,017
Mr.Dyke comes at this time every night at 8 pm

56
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:52,798
Isomura was closely investigating his behavior

57
00:06:53,814 --> 00:07:00,878
I had to act for 30 minutes he was there

58
00:07:27,102 --> 00:07:31,265
That day I stayed at the Plaza Hotel

59
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:44,055
The next day he left the room at 8 pm, as expected

60
00:09:08,038 --> 00:09:09,310
On the rock

61
00:10:17,614 --> 00:10:20,192
One more on the rock

62
00:11:11,349 --> 00:11:12,990
Check please

63
00:11:30,472 --> 00:11:32,794
I need to go to front desk

64
00:11:33,865 --> 00:11:35,283
My bad

65
00:11:40,053 --> 00:11:42,173
I will be back soon

66
00:12:27,969 --> 00:12:29,342
I'm sorry

67
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:39,889
I don't drink anymore

68
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,864
Your Japanese is so good

69
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:46,511
I worked at a embassy in Japan three years ago

70
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,978
I miss Japanese women

71
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,306
I get it

72
00:12:50,998 --> 00:12:52,884
Good night

73
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:54,658
Good night

74
00:12:55,853 --> 00:12:57,694
He is kind

75
00:12:59,693 --> 00:13:01,188
I did something bad to him

76
00:15:25,339 --> 00:15:27,782
Let's invite Akiko tomorrow night and celebrate together

77
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:31,604
Shiina is a really kind person

78
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,791
Shall we go home soon?

79
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:37,452
If it's late, the branch manager will get angry

80
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:39,126
You are too serious

81
00:15:40,956 --> 00:15:43,144
It's OK

82
00:15:51,628 --> 00:15:53,704
I want to dance more

83
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:56,037
Ok just one more

84
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,117
I'm sorry

85
00:16:19,053 --> 00:16:20,147
It's OK

86
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:34,672
What's wrong?
I will take you to a hospital!

87
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:55,058
He seems to have lost consciousness

88
00:17:18,421 --> 00:17:20,062
Are you Shiina Jiro?

89
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,968
What is your status?

90
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,350
I am a member of Toa Research and Culture Research Institute

91
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,062
Don't tell a lie

92
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,691
I don't

93
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,392
You're a Japanese spy

94
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:40,947
No way

95
00:17:41,471 --> 00:17:43,290
You're a Japanese spy

96
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,585
I'm not

97
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,063
You're not

98
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:15,224
Let you tell the truth

99
00:18:33,093 --> 00:18:36,207
Tell the truth

100
00:18:38,004 --> 00:18:39,656
No way

101
00:19:03,964 --> 00:19:05,683
What is your status?

102
00:19:07,935 --> 00:19:11,082
I am a member of Toa Research and Culture Research Institute

103
00:19:19,895 --> 00:19:21,948
Tell the truth

104
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:25,509
I'm not spy

105
00:19:50,779 --> 00:19:55,433
Nazis are using this medicine

106
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,971
This works well

107
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:13,364
There is no doubt that Shiina left the hotel this morning

108
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,112
Yes

109
00:20:15,998 --> 00:20:21,891
I gave him the film.
He has to go here by 10 o'clock

110
00:20:23,442 --> 00:20:24,279
Come in

111
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:45,143
Shiina Jiro
You're a Japanese spy

112
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:49,860
Spy?

113
00:20:50,117 --> 00:20:53,432
Yes
You're a Japanese spy

114
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,191
I'm not

115
00:20:59,325 --> 00:21:05,239
You are.
You entered Dalek's room

116
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,493
What did you do there?

117
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:19,127
Where did I enter?

118
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,515
Room 443

119
00:21:22,933 --> 00:21:25,946
You entered Dalek's room

120
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:31,075
You entered Dalek's room

121
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,283
Here's not hotel

122
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:40,272
Where's here?

123
00:21:42,615 --> 00:21:46,812
I want to get out of here

124
00:21:53,295 --> 00:22:02,379
Tell me what you are thinking now

125
00:22:05,808 --> 00:22:07,080
About Akiko

126
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:08,777
Akiko?

127
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:25,510
I want to see her again

128
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:28,846
Didn't you enter his room?

129
00:22:49,628 --> 00:22:54,048
Hello?
Yes, Please wait

130
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:04,289
Is Isomura there?
There is a problem. I’ll put you through to My sister.

131
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,686
I'm Akiko.
I happened to see a foreigner taking Mr. Shiina to a Western-style building.

132
00:23:14,579 --> 00:23:17,537
Really?
Where did it happen?

133
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:26,761
Here

134
00:23:27,922 --> 00:23:30,947
If I don't come back after 5 minutes please contact the police

135
00:23:31,282 --> 00:23:31,806
I get it

136
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,279
Let's go

137
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:12,431
Shiina!

138
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:16,527
Isomura!

139
00:25:21,143 --> 00:25:22,270
Shiina!

140
00:25:53,959 --> 00:26:00,878
On November 14th, I received an emergency return order from Lieutenant Colonel Kusanagi.

141
00:26:01,592 --> 00:26:09,650
I headed directly from Yokohama Port to the Army General Staff Headquarters

142
00:26:17,264 --> 00:26:22,086
You stole a lot of information in Hong Kong

143
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:30,456
The reason I brought you back to Japan was because of a big problem

144
00:26:31,081 --> 00:26:32,309
What do you mean?

145
00:26:32,956 --> 00:26:37,041
There was a meeting in Kyushu on the day you went to Hong Kong

146
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:41,673
Japan's national policy was decided at the meeting

147
00:26:42,086 --> 00:26:48,782
No war will occur if US-Japan negotiations are agreed by December 1st

148
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:56,907
If the US-Japan negotiations do not agree, a war may occur

149
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:59,563
Is that secret leaked?

150
00:27:00,456 --> 00:27:04,072
Actually, I found that from that film you got from Hong Kong.

151
00:27:04,496 --> 00:27:05,836
from that film?

152
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:18,313
They learned that the deadline for US-Japan negotiations was December 1st.
It can be assumed that they will further act as information spies.

153
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:27,364
I want you to find that leak route

154
00:27:29,377 --> 00:27:33,306
Prime Minister Tojo attended the meeting with 14 people.

155
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:40,326
I looked up those 14 people or they weren't suspicious

156
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:44,645
But half of them are very patriots

157
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:54,779
I felt that there was something with Dr. Ohara, who has something to do with senior military personnel.

158
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:57,948
What?Dr. Ohara?

159
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:06,040
He is in the hospital now but can visit for 30 minutes

160
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,197
Did you look up his list of visitors?

161
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:15,956
No one is suspicious so far, but I'm trying to find out

162
00:28:15,981 --> 00:28:19,093
I get it.
Have a drink

163
00:28:25,352 --> 00:28:26,401
Good evening

164
00:28:26,925 --> 00:28:30,943
Hi,
Serve them

165
00:28:34,489 --> 00:28:38,127
I think I'll work on you guys tonight.
She's Kogiku

166
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:48,633
Here it is

167
00:28:58,083 --> 00:29:03,071
Don't be wary of her.
She is also a graduate of Nakano School

168
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:07,525
She is the only woman I trust

169
00:29:08,395 --> 00:29:11,118
I'm Kogiku.
Nice to meet you

170
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:19,891
Her husband helped me to build Nakano School

171
00:29:20,370 --> 00:29:23,439
But he died on the way

172
00:29:24,344 --> 00:29:30,795
I was asked by her to cooperate with us

173
00:29:31,364 --> 00:29:33,574
So she is in charge of this position

174
00:29:33,663 --> 00:29:37,726
I see.
I'm Jiro Shiina, a first-year student

175
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,650
I'm Sankichi Kariya, his junior

176
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:45,538
Let's continue the previous story.
Did you find out about Mr. Ohara's family and servants?

177
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:49,266
His wife died of tuberculosis 5 years ago

178
00:29:49,656 --> 00:29:55,471
Currently there is a maid who has been a nurse for over 30 years.

179
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:58,998
There is one man studying law

180
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:02,301
3 have a guarantor

181
00:30:02,837 --> 00:30:04,935
He had only one daughter

182
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:08,228
She is now the wife of Yamato Bussan Hong Kong branch manager

183
00:30:08,797 --> 00:30:14,188
I met her for the first time in Hong Kong

184
00:30:15,371 --> 00:30:20,516
I see.
You also searched for a marriage partner

185
00:30:20,906 --> 00:30:23,239
She has a fiancé

186
00:30:23,953 --> 00:30:26,587
Isomura from the Navy.

187
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:29,221
What a shame
(Japanese navy vs army joke as he belongs to the army side)

188
00:30:29,941 --> 00:30:32,128
I know him

189
00:30:33,155 --> 00:30:34,483
You know?

190
00:30:35,644 --> 00:30:43,401
There was a welcome party for military personnel who returned from Hong Kong about 5 days ago.

191
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:47,374
If I remember correctly. His name was Isomura Captain...

192
00:30:55,783 --> 00:31:01,207
I don't think Mr. Ohara will leak information, but please investigate just in case.

193
00:31:01,977 --> 00:31:04,857
Fortunately Masako returned Day before yesterday

194
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,323
With Akiko too

195
00:31:07,926 --> 00:31:13,517
She came back without deciding where to work

196
00:31:14,421 --> 00:31:15,917
She is staying at Ohara's house now

197
00:31:18,004 --> 00:31:20,124
What's wrong?

198
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,473
Nothing.
I'll visit her now

199
00:31:41,057 --> 00:31:42,040
Masako

200
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:43,457
Oh

201
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:50,198
I learned from Mr. Isomura that you have returned to Japan

202
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:53,144
I'm happy to see you again

203
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:58,735
He was convened by the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff because he was familiar with the Southern situation.

204
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:00,555
Good for him

205
00:32:01,448 --> 00:32:04,182
I will meet him next Saturday

206
00:32:04,696 --> 00:32:06,571
Do you draw a picture of a flower

207
00:32:10,905 --> 00:32:12,534
There is something black on your face

208
00:32:13,706 --> 00:32:15,235
I'm embarrassed

209
00:32:26,816 --> 00:32:27,564
Who is he?

210
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:32,095
He is Mr. Oyamada of the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff.
He sometime visit my grand father

211
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:33,635
I see

212
00:32:33,948 --> 00:32:38,066
Can you go out with me today?
I want to surprise you

213
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:39,428
What's that?

214
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,838
that's a secret

215
00:32:59,176 --> 00:32:59,924
Sis

216
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,759
Hi, Akiko.
Thank you for everything in Hong Kong.

217
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,575
Long time no see

218
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:12,708
I went to the Toa Institute when I came back to Japan to meet you

219
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:18,299
But You were absent

220
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:21,513
I'm part-time so I'm not in the lab

221
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:26,737
She was looking for ways to meet you

222
00:33:26,859 --> 00:33:27,685
I'm embarrassed

223
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,594
Hi Masako

224
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:32,094
Mizuike sensei

225
00:33:33,726 --> 00:33:36,628
I'm going to see your work

226
00:33:36,996 --> 00:33:39,686
Hello?
I'm Mizuike

227
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:44,898
I'm on my way to the museum too

228
00:33:51,053 --> 00:33:55,339
This coffee reminds me of Hong Kong

229
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,026
I think there will be more opportunities to drink coffee

230
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:03,269
When did you come to shanghai?

231
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:07,242
I went there this spring

232
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,889
At that time I draw that picture.
Do you know shanghai well?

233
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,720
I came on a business trip last year

234
00:34:14,745 --> 00:34:16,896
Are you a military person?

235
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:23,290
I'm not.
We are working to get people to understand the oriental culture

236
00:34:23,326 --> 00:34:24,718
I see

237
00:34:25,187 --> 00:34:27,933
What are you drawing now?

238
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,663
Gozen meeting

239
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,259
Gozen meeting?

240
00:34:31,526 --> 00:34:38,558
The government asked me to do the job

241
00:34:39,607 --> 00:34:43,982
I want to express it in my own way

242
00:34:45,243 --> 00:34:46,984
It seems to be difficult

243
00:34:47,009 --> 00:34:51,571
Yes,
I am moved by the hearts of women

244
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:56,035
I want to make a picture of you

245
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,171
No way

246
00:35:01,612 --> 00:35:09,771
According to a survey he lives in an atelier.
His wife is french

247
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:16,110
Currently he is ill and hospitalized

248
00:35:16,791 --> 00:35:19,101
It’s the same as the nurse at Mr. Ohara ’s house.

249
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,258
We should investigate Mr. Ohara's house more

250
00:35:47,816 --> 00:35:49,680
This is a plan view of Mr. Ohara's house.

251
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,676
Let's examine his range of action again

252
00:35:55,305 --> 00:35:56,823
How about the female relationship of the painter?

253
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:57,984
He's play boy

254
00:35:58,319 --> 00:35:59,546
Does he play?

255
00:35:59,571 --> 00:36:00,562
Yes

256
00:36:01,175 --> 00:36:05,060
He was there when I was with Kusanagi-san

257
00:36:09,017 --> 00:36:09,754
Really?

258
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:10,948
Please

259
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:16,696
Be careful because she is a woman

260
00:36:18,682 --> 00:36:27,198
Churchill says Britain will enter the war within an hour if Japan and the United States fight.

261
00:36:27,868 --> 00:36:29,307
I see

262
00:36:37,784 --> 00:36:48,231
The Navy's ship preparing for the war with the United States left secretly yesterday

263
00:36:51,312 --> 00:36:55,107
It is impossible for the US-Japan negotiations to be concluded by December 1st

264
00:36:58,187 --> 00:37:00,743
Pay attention to how it will be a war

265
00:37:06,272 --> 00:37:07,801
It's weird

266
00:37:08,181 --> 00:37:11,953
Really.
She is so pure

267
00:37:12,288 --> 00:37:14,844
If she doesn't like it, she refuses everything

268
00:37:15,179 --> 00:37:17,779
Why she invites me?

269
00:37:17,804 --> 00:37:22,299
It's very strange

270
00:37:24,375 --> 00:37:28,125
Perhaps she is interested in your painting

271
00:37:28,866 --> 00:37:31,980
She wanted to see you so much

272
00:37:33,364 --> 00:37:39,614
She is your great fan

273
00:37:44,251 --> 00:37:45,679
Good evening

274
00:37:58,498 --> 00:38:00,049
Then see you

275
00:38:07,014 --> 00:38:12,561
I thought I couldn't meet because you look busy.
You have time today, right?

276
00:38:13,308 --> 00:38:16,154
I will entertain you with Masako

277
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:18,688
But I don't have enough time

278
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,614
Masako-san hasn't finished drawing the picture yet.?

279
00:38:29,842 --> 00:38:35,009
Please put the flower out

280
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:29,673
Is Mr. Mizuike the other day her painting teacher?

281
00:39:29,698 --> 00:39:32,965
She was taught by him before going to Hong Kong

282
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,199
Her mother and Mr. Mizuike are acquainted

283
00:39:38,824 --> 00:39:40,554
Does he come here often?

284
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,831
He does not come lately

285
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,780
I see

286
00:39:44,293 --> 00:39:45,499
I prepare tea

287
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:47,139
Thanks

288
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,400
I wonder if I'll look at her picture

289
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:12,031
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting

290
00:40:12,254 --> 00:40:15,334
Since there are many customers, Mr. Ohara is busy

291
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:19,654
I don't know if he's sick or something

292
00:40:22,645 --> 00:40:26,439
Thank you for your distribution next week.

293
00:40:26,473 --> 00:40:27,399
Thanks

294
00:41:20,988 --> 00:41:22,830
No reaction

295
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:33,460
I should have done something if she was snooping

296
00:41:33,538 --> 00:41:35,335
I don't think she had a chance

297
00:41:36,741 --> 00:41:41,730
Thanks.
Please contact them to expand his range of activities

298
00:41:45,575 --> 00:41:49,069
Japan-US negotiations virtually broke down

299
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:55,821
Government meeting was held on November 29

300
00:41:57,145 --> 00:42:05,717
The enemy espionage we have marked has gradually escalated.

301
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:10,359
I've always been concerned about you

302
00:42:10,684 --> 00:42:14,222
Have you finished your work yet?

303
00:42:14,333 --> 00:42:15,963
I have not finished all

304
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:20,543
I will take you wherever you like today

305
00:42:21,547 --> 00:42:22,764
Your home

306
00:42:23,132 --> 00:42:24,092
My home?

307
00:42:24,561 --> 00:42:26,503
I'm hungry

308
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:30,158
Would you like to dine at a hotel in Akasaka?

309
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,071
You don't like?

310
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,609
I want to cook you something

311
00:42:41,634 --> 00:42:42,469
To me?

312
00:42:42,703 --> 00:42:44,756
I am confident in cooking

313
00:42:44,781 --> 00:42:46,419
OK let's go!

314
00:42:55,878 --> 00:42:58,936
We can share this if you like

315
00:42:59,427 --> 00:43:01,492
Really?

316
00:43:03,311 --> 00:43:04,728
about 100g

317
00:43:04,862 --> 00:43:06,860
Thank you

318
00:43:11,182 --> 00:43:13,771
Thank you

319
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:24,218
I will contact them that I can't go to work today

320
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:41,401
Follow that car

321
00:43:47,496 --> 00:43:48,277
Hello?

322
00:43:50,587 --> 00:43:51,614
Oh Kogiku

323
00:43:54,203 --> 00:43:56,580
To his home?

324
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,219
Did something strange happen?

325
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,785
He brought coffee beans?

326
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,010
I care about it

327
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:14,791
Anyway take care

328
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:20,077
Sorry for keeping you waiting

329
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,996
Thank you for calling

330
00:45:22,443 --> 00:45:25,266
I heard you will get a job from today

331
00:45:25,579 --> 00:45:27,956
I work at St. Joseph Hospital

332
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:32,175
Mizuike's wife is also hospitalized there.

333
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,202
Really?

334
00:45:33,425 --> 00:45:36,595
The world is small
Who introduced you to the job?

335
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:40,070
The director of the hospital when I was in Hong Kong introduced me

336
00:45:40,327 --> 00:45:43,954
I want to celebrate you tonight

337
00:45:50,234 --> 00:45:54,531
It ’s very quiet and calming here.

338
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,931
Isn't it cold?

339
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:02,757
I drank alcohol so my body is warm

340
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:05,678
Do you wanna drink little more?

341
00:46:05,778 --> 00:46:07,039
No thanks

342
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,830
I won't drink too

343
00:46:10,343 --> 00:46:12,240
I hear you can drink very much

344
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,522
I get sleepy if I drink too much

345
00:46:16,057 --> 00:46:18,222
How is Mr. Ohara's health?How is Mr. Ohara's health?

346
00:46:18,468 --> 00:46:20,187
He got better

347
00:46:20,443 --> 00:46:24,584
He always has a long conversation even when customers come

348
00:46:26,288 --> 00:46:28,933
Can you trust that nurse?

349
00:46:29,167 --> 00:46:32,415
I have no idea but she care him very well

350
00:46:34,346 --> 00:46:35,841
Why do you think so?

351
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:37,873
Nothing

352
00:46:39,741 --> 00:46:42,620
I think Masako's bride is very cute

353
00:46:42,743 --> 00:46:44,830
Do you want to get married?

354
00:46:45,165 --> 00:46:48,312
I sometimes think of it

355
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:56,951
I sometimes feel lonely to be alone in a world like this

356
00:46:58,123 --> 00:47:05,768
I often go abroad for work.
I always think it's important to be with someone I can trust

357
00:47:09,467 --> 00:47:12,078
I'm tired from time to time

358
00:47:14,043 --> 00:47:20,281
Sometimes I think of something else even with you

359
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:31,873
I'm trying to find out the secret of that nurse from you

360
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:34,704
Why do you suddenly say that ?

361
00:47:37,371 --> 00:47:41,769
Actually, I don't belong to Toa Institute

362
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:44,347
I can't tell you further detail

363
00:47:45,083 --> 00:47:48,365
So you were looking into her

364
00:47:50,541 --> 00:47:55,530
In addition to that nurse, Mr. Mizuike is also investigating.

365
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:03,476
I'm investigating the organization behind them

366
00:48:07,478 --> 00:48:09,342
Can you forgive me?

367
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:18,594
I'm glad you told me the truth

368
00:48:27,747 --> 00:48:32,725
Hello? Yes, I'm SHiina

369
00:48:35,865 --> 00:48:37,450
Ok. I'll get back soon

370
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:47,506
I have an urgent need, so I'm going home

371
00:48:48,711 --> 00:48:51,423
This is who I am

372
00:48:53,484 --> 00:48:56,787
Will you meet me again?

373
00:48:59,533 --> 00:49:03,852
I wish I had a calmer world

374
00:49:04,923 --> 00:49:07,914
I may not be able to meet you anymore

375
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:15,827
I'm really happy that you have fulfilled your promise in Hong Kong

376
00:49:17,766 --> 00:49:18,915
Akiko

377
00:49:36,064 --> 00:49:37,605
I love you

378
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:52,932
As you said, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Area is near.

379
00:49:53,971 --> 00:50:01,382
If today's meeting decides, Japan will attack the U.S.

380
00:50:02,832 --> 00:50:12,396
The Army is ready.
The Navy is also ready

381
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:16,966
It seems that the war is about to begin

382
00:50:44,923 --> 00:50:46,252
Hello

383
00:50:47,524 --> 00:50:48,517
I'll give you coffee

384
00:50:50,593 --> 00:50:51,642
Real coffee?

385
00:50:51,999 --> 00:50:53,004
Sure

386
00:51:20,228 --> 00:51:21,266
Sensei

387
00:51:43,948 --> 00:51:48,524
Mr. Mizuike gave coffee beans to a foreigner living next door?

388
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:53,390
The man is a doctor in the St. Joseph Hospital

389
00:51:54,709 --> 00:51:58,247
The owner of the pharmacy is Bunichi Minami.
Coffee shop master is Koji Minami

390
00:51:59,654 --> 00:52:01,663
They are from South Korea

391
00:52:10,743 --> 00:52:12,417
How about such an information route?

392
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:20,397
Nurse Kazuecatches some information From the story of a customer who visited Mr. Ohara's house

393
00:52:21,078 --> 00:52:25,709
She then fakes a drug order and gives it to the apothecary, Mr. Minami.

394
00:52:27,673 --> 00:52:32,003
He then gives it to his brother

395
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:38,879
Put it in a coffee bag and give it to that foreigner

396
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:45,803
I see.
Everything is related to St. Joseph Hospital

397
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:50,446
I will go to Mr. Mizuike

398
00:52:51,919 --> 00:52:53,873
Mr. Tanaka is currently watching him

399
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:56,094
Kogiku is in danger

400
00:53:19,164 --> 00:53:20,313
What's wrong?

401
00:53:20,548 --> 00:53:23,996
I have an appointment.
I need to go

402
00:53:26,586 --> 00:53:29,566
I will send you if you return

403
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:32,568
I cook and wait for you

404
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,398
Thanks

405
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:05,208
Hey. What are you doing?

406
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:14,701
Say it

407
00:55:15,806 --> 00:55:18,596
Who asked you to do it?

408
00:55:20,047 --> 00:55:21,398
Who the hell you are?

409
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:25,918
I can kill you

410
00:55:26,668 --> 00:55:27,650
I don't care if you kill me

411
00:55:27,773 --> 00:55:29,737
Don't be strong

412
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:42,524
Hello?
I'm Mizuike

413
00:55:42,702 --> 00:55:44,577
Did you forget the promised time?

414
00:55:44,856 --> 00:55:47,724
I'm sorry, I forgot something.

415
00:55:48,338 --> 00:55:49,477
Come here right away

416
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:51,720
I will go immediately after organizing the room

417
00:55:55,414 --> 00:55:56,820
Damn it

418
00:56:35,168 --> 00:56:36,396
Follow him

419
00:56:59,781 --> 00:57:03,486
Are you OK,Kogiku

420
00:57:06,131 --> 00:57:10,104
Shiina-san
Fukuzawa no...

421
00:57:14,482 --> 00:57:16,022
Kogiku-san

422
00:57:41,522 --> 00:57:44,948
I can have this at that location in less than 30 minutes.

423
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,730
What?
Mizuike was died?

424
00:59:32,964 --> 00:59:36,044
I can have this at that location in less than 30 minutes.

425
00:59:40,436 --> 00:59:45,257
I thought that if Akiko Ichinose was a spy, there would be some action.

426
00:59:46,585 --> 00:59:48,806
I'm surprised they killed their fellow Mizuike.

427
00:59:49,130 --> 00:59:51,362
They seems to be in a hurry.

428
00:59:53,416 --> 01:00:02,278
I heard from Mr. Kusanagi that Japan and the United States will have a war at today's conference.

429
01:00:04,548 --> 01:00:08,800
The number of cryptocurrency stores of spy organizations suddenly increased

430
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,579
It's only a matter of time before this secret is leaked

431
01:00:24,123 --> 01:00:30,742
The base of the spy organization is around here on the map

432
01:00:32,305 --> 01:00:35,419
If the code is sent again, the location will be known for sure.

433
01:00:36,524 --> 01:00:39,615
What if it was the last confidential information about the war between Japan and the United States?

434
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,158
It is not good to rely on the enemy's radio wave transmission

435
01:00:46,098 --> 01:00:50,461
Now let us go to St. Joseph Hospital to find out

436
01:00:50,506 --> 01:00:55,305
They are run by foreigners so we can't move until we find evidence

437
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:56,633
Just in case

438
01:00:56,834 --> 01:00:58,285
Do we leave this problem alone?

439
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:05,923
I will invite Akiko again or

440
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:10,890
She'll use the next means.

441
01:01:13,423 --> 01:01:14,417
maybe

442
01:01:20,555 --> 01:01:22,943
Hi, Isomura-san

443
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,734
Hello, I'm Isomura.
How are you,Akiko?

444
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:35,957
Masako?
Where is the hospital?

445
01:01:37,296 --> 01:01:40,990
I will go to Minato Hospital in Yokohama soon

446
01:01:45,321 --> 01:01:47,129
Please transfer to Ms. Ohara

447
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:52,034
She is out now

448
01:01:52,992 --> 01:01:54,667
Hello

449
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:00,772
From whom?

450
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:02,647
Nothing

451
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:23,805
You are Mr. Isomura

452
01:02:24,229 --> 01:02:25,478
Where is Masako's hospital room?

453
01:02:25,669 --> 01:02:30,512
She was taken to St. Joseph Hospital because she couldn't operate here

454
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:31,617
St. Joseph ?

455
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:33,102
I'll take you there

456
01:03:02,685 --> 01:03:04,805
Shiina-san
I have something to do with you

457
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,167
What's wrong?

458
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:08,377
Isomura is missing

459
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:09,884
Really?

460
01:03:10,955 --> 01:03:17,853
He was called to come to a hospital in Yokohama because I was injured

461
01:03:18,662 --> 01:03:19,577
I see

462
01:03:20,291 --> 01:03:22,323
What's wrong with him?

463
01:03:22,925 --> 01:03:28,372
He was in the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff as a Navy officer

464
01:03:28,907 --> 01:03:32,300
He seems to have been involved with an enemy spy

465
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,923
Really?

466
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:41,419
Akiko Ichinose kidnapped him

467
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:46,307
I can't believe it

468
01:03:46,474 --> 01:03:48,829
She is a member of the spy

469
01:03:49,477 --> 01:03:53,416
I wanted you to call her

470
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,222
I can't believe who she is

471
01:04:27,386 --> 01:04:29,462
Where is the nurse, Kazue?

472
01:04:29,998 --> 01:04:32,319
I think she's in the room

473
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:04,310
Mr. Isomura is in a dangerous state.
You should wait here

474
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:09,366
Ogawa is chasing her because the nurse ran away

475
01:05:09,466 --> 01:05:11,631
Please contact the military command urgently

476
01:05:34,895 --> 01:05:36,558
Yamamoto. please

477
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:46,130
Please

478
01:07:06,244 --> 01:07:09,414
10 am.
Where was he taken out?

479
01:07:17,576 --> 01:07:18,982
Take this

480
01:07:26,705 --> 01:07:30,187
I'm waiting for you at the lock behind the hospital.
Akiko

481
01:07:53,254 --> 01:07:55,464
Thanks for coming

482
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:57,652
What did you do about Isomura

483
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:23,272
You can meet him if I get in my car

484
01:08:24,377 --> 01:08:28,429
You are Japanese but why do you pass information to the enemy?

485
01:08:28,808 --> 01:08:34,958
I'm not Japanese.
I love my homeland

486
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:42,958
It can't be helped but I thank you

487
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,842
Don't chase me anymore

488
01:08:47,712 --> 01:08:48,538
See you

489
01:09:02,786 --> 01:09:03,936
Go

490
01:09:08,322 --> 01:09:09,215
See you

491
01:09:16,414 --> 01:09:17,608
See you

492
01:10:03,560 --> 01:10:10,390
At that time, the Navy was heading for Pearl Harbor in Hawaii.

493
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:15,870
The warship was running around 40 ° north latitude

494
01:10:31,285 --> 01:10:32,033
How was it?

495
01:10:32,234 --> 01:10:34,299
I got a photo of alien registration

496
01:10:36,453 --> 01:10:37,837
From hospital officials

497
01:10:41,285 --> 01:10:44,712
Hello?
Oh Shiina

498
01:10:47,111 --> 01:10:49,556
I now have a photo of a hospital official

499
01:10:49,957 --> 01:10:53,138
Please come to Keihin National Highway with it

500
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:56,495
See you

501
01:11:00,223 --> 01:11:01,149
Hurry up

502
01:11:31,195 --> 01:11:37,010
This is a picture that KOGIKU found at Mizuike's house.

503
01:11:39,075 --> 01:11:41,831
I checked mine against the photo on the alien registration.

504
01:11:48,856 --> 01:11:50,687
He's the x-ray technician, Mr. Steiny.

505
01:11:51,256 --> 01:11:52,796
Yes he is

506
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:09,696
Something is strange.
Check by device

507
01:12:42,084 --> 01:12:43,010
He's foreigner

508
01:12:43,903 --> 01:12:45,120
Who is he?

509
01:12:46,169 --> 01:12:51,872
He is an outpatient and is not registered as an alien

510
01:12:53,917 --> 01:12:58,878
I remember,
He threatened me in Hong Kong P agency man

511
01:12:59,831 --> 01:13:00,792
P agency?

512
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,002
He is now at St. Joseph Hospital

513
01:13:04,948 --> 01:13:06,902
We're heading to the hospital

514
01:13:07,636 --> 01:13:09,019
Contact the Kenpeitai

515
01:13:10,594 --> 01:13:12,351
Is the report complete?

516
01:13:28,868 --> 01:13:32,946
This Amobarbital is more powerful than the one used for Mr. Shiina in Hong Kong.

517
01:13:34,802 --> 01:13:37,239
He is from the Nakano School of the Army

518
01:13:38,325 --> 01:13:42,192
The Cloud 15 Directive etc. are all his achievements

519
01:13:43,411 --> 01:13:47,200
Recently the drug was caught by him

520
01:13:48,685 --> 01:13:51,919
We'll take him down.

521
01:13:52,122 --> 01:13:53,185
Akiko

522
01:13:55,004 --> 01:13:55,964
Get ready

523
01:14:10,764 --> 01:14:12,178
This drug works soon

524
01:14:13,311 --> 01:14:16,757
You will speak sensitive information without your consciousness

525
01:14:17,718 --> 01:14:19,616
We will report it to America

526
01:14:20,678 --> 01:14:23,468
Japan can't do anything

527
01:14:26,468 --> 01:14:30,804
We are homeland freed from Japanese colonies

528
01:14:31,812 --> 01:14:33,257
We'll be free

529
01:14:43,678 --> 01:14:49,911
Where is the Japanese Navy riot police now?

530
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,655
Tell me where they are

531
01:14:55,858 --> 01:14:56,851
Where?

532
01:14:58,390 --> 01:14:59,077
Tell me

533
01:15:01,585 --> 01:15:02,718
Chishima

534
01:15:04,562 --> 01:15:06,054
Single crown bay

535
01:15:06,476 --> 01:15:07,359
Single crown bay?

536
01:15:08,327 --> 01:15:09,249
Are they there now?

537
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:18,847
They are now in the northeastern Pacific

538
01:15:20,019 --> 01:15:22,597
Where are they heading?

539
01:15:25,308 --> 01:15:26,144
To Hawaii

540
01:15:26,285 --> 01:15:27,199
To Hawaii?

541
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,535
Pearl Harbor

542
01:15:34,121 --> 01:15:35,965
When?

543
01:15:37,058 --> 01:15:38,113
What time

544
01:15:49,068 --> 01:15:50,325
December

545
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:53,193
8th

546
01:15:55,482 --> 01:15:58,443
Is that true?

547
01:16:02,571 --> 01:16:06,227
Send this information immediately

548
01:16:06,969 --> 01:16:08,524
We will leave after sending the information

549
01:16:34,026 --> 01:16:40,056
I was fired by a man who followed me.
Japanese intelligence will be here

550
01:16:40,487 --> 01:16:42,393
Please contact your home country as soon as possible

551
01:17:28,805 --> 01:17:32,571
I caught a strong radio wave from this direction

552
01:17:33,126 --> 01:17:34,688
Let's investigate this hospital

553
01:17:35,759 --> 01:17:38,399
Contact me to turn off the main power of this hospital

554
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:40,227
Kariya

555
01:17:41,868 --> 01:17:43,657
Investigate this hospital

556
01:17:45,751 --> 01:17:47,274
I will investigate this hospital

557
01:17:49,462 --> 01:17:50,868
Get on work

558
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:00,411
Send information as soon as possible

559
01:18:24,854 --> 01:18:27,292
I will talk about the situation later.
Turn off the main power

560
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:30,659
I can't do that because it's during surgery

561
01:18:30,909 --> 01:18:31,698
Please

562
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:34,940
I can't do that for another hour

563
01:18:40,364 --> 01:18:45,082
It seems that the power cannot be turned off during surgery now.

564
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:46,207
What should we do?

565
01:18:49,184 --> 01:18:52,215
Get jamming from your car

566
01:18:52,981 --> 01:18:54,114
I get it

567
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,692
But I can only give it for 10 minutes

568
01:18:57,121 --> 01:18:59,700
10 mins, ok hurry up

569
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,174
There is no problem

570
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,615
We should hurry up

571
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:57,528
4 mins left

572
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,733
Go in

573
01:21:25,065 --> 01:21:26,059
Nothing problem

574
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:42,573
Wait

575
01:22:04,869 --> 01:22:05,761
Shiina-san

576
01:22:11,369 --> 01:22:13,278
You guys wait here

577
01:22:37,586 --> 01:22:41,001
We will arrest you for espionage!

578
01:22:41,459 --> 01:22:42,419
Stay down

579
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:33,773
We don't have time

580
01:23:38,153 --> 01:23:41,155
Send it quickly.

581
01:24:37,554 --> 01:24:38,704
Isomura

582
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:11,760
All of the spy cells that attempted to transmit information to the country at 1:00 a.m. on December 4 were killed.

583
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:30,275
At 6 a.m. on December 8, the Japanese were at war with the Americans in the Western Pacific.

584
01:25:49,755 --> 01:25:55,414
Oyamda leader visited me at that day

585
01:25:56,015 --> 01:26:00,056
will

586
01:26:00,081 --> 01:26:02,969
Hiroshi Isomura

587
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:11,061
He committed suicide.

588
01:26:12,724 --> 01:26:20,548
Confessions were demanded of him by enemy operatives.

589
01:26:21,437 --> 01:26:29,986
I get it.
But Are you aware that military secrets were tapped by the Ohara house?

590
01:26:31,828 --> 01:26:33,580
I don't want to talk with you anymore

591
01:26:42,788 --> 01:26:45,232
Force majeure is not allowed for military personnel.

592
01:26:46,539 --> 01:26:49,195
He was sent to the front lines of the war.

593
01:26:53,075 --> 01:27:09,325
We, the Japanese, launched a surprise attack on the Malay Peninsula at 11:50 on the 8th.

594
01:27:10,073 --> 01:27:14,794
We're getting results.

595
01:27:17,674 --> 01:27:20,363
Japan will be in difficult situation

596
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:28,388
We too must reconsider the mission of the Nakano School.

597
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:38,339
With the start of the war on December 8, Japan expanded its front to the Pacific Ocean

598
01:27:38,527 --> 01:27:44,886
Japan will fight against the United States and Britain as enemies

599
01:27:45,586 --> 01:27:48,633
We have taken on a harsh fate.

600
01:28:02,219 --> 01:28:10,545
I could not imagine my next mission

601
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,938
THE END

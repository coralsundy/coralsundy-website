2
00:00:43,033 --> 00:00:43,799
Excuse me

3
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:46,432
you get up early in the morning

4
00:00:46,744 --> 00:00:47,869
You too

5
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:48,713
Yeah

6
00:00:50,463 --> 00:00:51,823
Next stop is Hiroshima

7
00:00:52,987 --> 00:00:55,565
Are you getting off?
Thanks for last night

8
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,276
Not at all, it's just beer

9
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:01,815
I wonder where's your bar

10
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,612
i gave you my business card

11
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:05,174
Oh yeah

12
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:07,080
If you come to Hakata, please come and see me.

13
00:01:07,105 --> 00:01:08,440
Let's drink together in Nakatsu

14
00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:11,229
i drink more than you

15
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:16,002
your back is very nice

16
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:17,112
Thanks

17
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:18,151
See you

18
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:32,273
Excuse me

19
00:02:11,747 --> 00:02:13,403
To New Hiroshima Hotel

20
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:40,127
Sono yo wa wasurenai (1962)
(A Night to Remember / Hiroshima Heartache)

21
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:42,372
Welcome

22
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:44,903
Welcome

23
00:04:44,928 --> 00:04:46,387
I'm Kamiya from Weekly Journal

24
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,379
Your room is ready

25
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,723
Please fill in this form

26
00:05:03,208 --> 00:05:05,896
The dining room will open in 10 minutes

27
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,267
Hello?
Chugoku TV ?

28
00:05:43,685 --> 00:05:45,615
Oh you, I've just arrived

29
00:05:46,228 --> 00:05:49,900
I hear you called me earlier

30
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:56,759
I've been working all night.
A new video system was developed

31
00:05:58,682 --> 00:06:03,057
Did you come here to cover the atomic bombing?

32
00:06:04,892 --> 00:06:06,525
What? you came here for that?

33
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:09,533
It's kind of..

34
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:15,307
Atomic Bomb Memorial Day is held once a year, and today marks 17 years since the day the atomic bomb was dropped.

35
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:17,932
That's boring report

36
00:06:19,064 --> 00:06:21,838
The reporter seems to be having a hard time finding a story.

37
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:25,674
I know how you feel

38
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:30,279
Kusanari? Yes I have it

39
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:32,630
Let's have a drink together after a long time

40
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:36,291
I'll contact you later

41
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:38,244
See you

42
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:41,744
It's been 17 years since the atomic bomb was dropped.

43
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,049
Let's make it quick

44
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,259
Please come in

45
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:09,744
There are few visitors

46
00:09:09,837 --> 00:09:15,079
There are usually few visitors.
However, many visitors come every year before the anniversary of the atomic bombing.

47
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,072
Do people from Hiroshima come here?

48
00:09:17,298 --> 00:09:18,829
No one come

49
00:09:19,087 --> 00:09:20,533
don't they want to remember it?

50
00:09:20,603 --> 00:09:22,908
I have no idea

51
00:09:32,439 --> 00:09:39,682
The number of hospitalized patients at this hospital from January to today is 117.

52
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,424
13 of them had leukemia.
18 had liver damage

53
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:46,330
9 patients with cataracts

54
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,979
Surgical disease 12 Hypertension 8

55
00:09:49,151 --> 00:09:51,112
And other 12

56
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:57,947
Are there any special medical conditions that exist after the war

57
00:09:58,437 --> 00:10:03,539
I don't know what the future holds, but so far it's fine

58
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:09,414
There is a report on the effects of radioactivity

59
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,507
In other words, the atomic bomb is genetically related.

60
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:17,867
That's right.
However, it is not clinically proven yet.

61
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,836
So it means

62
00:10:21,351 --> 00:10:25,445
The issue of atomic bomb disease is very political

63
00:10:27,297 --> 00:10:31,992
University professor Asahina is researching the genetics of the atomic bomb

64
00:10:33,015 --> 00:10:35,007
Here's the report

65
00:10:38,928 --> 00:10:40,506
can you introduce him to me?

66
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:44,186
I’ll call him.
Why don't you see him tomorrow?

67
00:10:45,675 --> 00:10:47,096
do you want to see the hospital room?

68
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:48,417
Yes please

69
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,255
Excuse us

70
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:11,249
Excuse us

71
00:11:18,338 --> 00:11:19,526
Can I take a photo of you?

72
00:11:19,551 --> 00:11:20,284
Go ahead

73
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:21,393
How do you feel?

74
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,581
It's hot

75
00:11:32,856 --> 00:11:35,497
You got tanned, and look fine

76
00:11:35,786 --> 00:11:39,239
I was in Tottori for practical training until yesterday.

77
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:40,934
It was fun

78
00:11:42,723 --> 00:11:43,770
I shot like this

79
00:11:45,216 --> 00:11:46,122
Excuse us

80
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:47,419
Please

81
00:11:47,966 --> 00:11:50,137
Japan's army has changed

82
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:53,341
Humans used to take the place of bombs.

83
00:11:53,366 --> 00:11:55,177
I joined not army but self defense force

84
00:11:55,202 --> 00:11:56,309
It's same

85
00:11:59,044 --> 00:12:00,997
You eat a lot. You'll be fine

86
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:35,950
Oh yeah, there use to be 500000 members

87
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:41,497
You guys used to meet once a month.

88
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:47,091
We used to share our common feeling

89
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:50,137
But now w don't have to do that

90
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,786
So Are there any effects of the A-bomb now?

91
00:12:57,387 --> 00:13:00,372
I can't say there's no effect but I have no idea

92
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:06,583
Can I see your member list if you don't mind?

93
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:34,457
Excuse me but is here Fusako Tamura's home?

94
00:13:35,973 --> 00:13:37,269
I'm the Fusako

95
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:38,262
Hello

96
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:43,832
well..I'm this person

97
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,762
I heard about you at Kusanabe party

98
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:52,238
Oh, you wanna ask me about atomic bomb, come in

99
00:13:52,683 --> 00:13:53,933
Come in

100
00:13:54,394 --> 00:13:55,191
Thanks

101
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,896
It's hot. please take off your jacket

102
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,402
Don't worry

103
00:14:32,473 --> 00:14:33,395
Enjoy your tea

104
00:14:35,895 --> 00:14:36,926
When did you visit him?

105
00:14:37,301 --> 00:14:38,106
This morning

106
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:41,983
It's hot here,right?

107
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:45,381
This is me

108
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:47,694
This

109
00:14:49,419 --> 00:14:55,840
At the time I hated having my picture taken. They gave me candy and took my picture.

110
00:14:57,028 --> 00:14:59,645
You don't care now?

111
00:15:00,247 --> 00:15:03,973
No matter how much I hate it, this aftereffect will never go away.

112
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:06,637
Oh yeah

113
00:15:08,801 --> 00:15:13,794
This is a photo I took at a roundtable meeting of survivors the year before last.

114
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,961
And this

115
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:17,000
That's enough

116
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:21,453
I wanna ask you one thing

117
00:15:21,617 --> 00:15:22,367
Tell me

118
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:24,883
This might be rude

119
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:26,766
Ask me anything you like

120
00:15:27,492 --> 00:15:31,836
I wanna ask you about your scar

121
00:15:32,453 --> 00:15:38,766
How can I say..I was wondering if you are happy or not

122
00:15:44,848 --> 00:15:47,808
Every News paper reporter ask me same

123
00:15:49,488 --> 00:15:50,199
Oops

124
00:15:51,152 --> 00:15:54,488
I know it's better not to have this

125
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:57,160
But It can't be helped

126
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:02,846
Sometimes even healthy people die in car accidents.

127
00:16:04,307 --> 00:16:05,033
I see

128
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:07,440
Please enjoy your tea

129
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:08,080
Thank you very much

130
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,940
Shall I go outside if you take a photo of me?

131
00:16:09,965 --> 00:16:10,955
Don't worry

132
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:14,471
It's really hot

133
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:51,721
Sorry to have kept you wait

134
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:59,276
An American newspaper said Hiroshima was in the business of atomic bombs.

135
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:06,019
The Americans might think I am doing business here.

136
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,644
But I don't mean to that

137
00:17:10,058 --> 00:17:14,840
There are people who don't know or have forgotten the atomic bomb.

138
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:16,113
That’s bad

139
00:17:16,777 --> 00:17:23,277
I want to help them understand the horror of the atomic bombing.

140
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:28,300
For that I am willing to take criticism.

141
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:29,660
Look at that

142
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:39,698
That A-Bomb Dome has endured 17 years of rain and wind.

143
00:17:40,347 --> 00:17:48,737
As long as people see my body and know the horror of the atomic bomb, I'm happy.

144
00:17:49,215 --> 00:17:50,886
Do you get it?

145
00:17:51,379 --> 00:17:52,324
I get it

146
00:18:26,446 --> 00:18:28,868
i want to forget the atomic bomb

147
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:36,587
But you're fired with the aftereffects of the atomic bomb.

148
00:18:37,358 --> 00:18:38,187
Can you see?

149
00:18:41,999 --> 00:18:44,381
You don't care?

150
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:49,569
I’m still young I’m enjoying my life

151
00:18:49,999 --> 00:18:50,726
do you enjoy life?

152
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,546
Yes I do

153
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,827
do you want to get married?

154
00:18:55,312 --> 00:18:56,093
Why you ask me?

155
00:18:56,187 --> 00:18:58,554
What if you love anyone?

156
00:18:58,593 --> 00:18:59,436
I have my boyfriend

157
00:18:59,461 --> 00:19:01,827
What are you doing?

158
00:19:02,533 --> 00:19:05,244
did you finish talking to her?

159
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:09,322
I may marry him next month

160
00:19:26,107 --> 00:19:31,240
Someone was sitting at the entrance when the atomic bomb was dropped

161
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:37,272
There's only her and her shadow left

162
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:44,663
The surface of the houses around here melted with heat of over 5000 degrees.

163
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,897
This place is 280 M away from the hypocenter.

164
00:19:54,032 --> 00:19:57,392
now there's nothing left

165
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,566
Hey kamiya!

166
00:21:33,215 --> 00:21:34,199
I'm here

167
00:21:34,527 --> 00:21:35,090

168
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:37,777
I sent ticket for you

169
00:21:37,802 --> 00:21:38,481
Thank you very much

170
00:21:38,551 --> 00:21:40,785
Don't stand up!

171
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:43,019
I’m sorry

172
00:21:47,312 --> 00:21:49,476
Hit the ball hard!

173
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:51,054
Hit the ball hard!

174
00:21:51,273 --> 00:21:52,640
How's going on your work?

175
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:55,101
Did you go to Kusanabe party?

176
00:21:55,468 --> 00:21:56,648
It wasn't going well

177
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,922
He's bad

178
00:21:59,422 --> 00:22:00,812
Not you but him

179
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,876
What are you doing?

180
00:22:11,392 --> 00:22:12,603
Damn it

181
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,517
she is a talent in our theater company

182
00:22:18,861 --> 00:22:21,165
I'm Etsuko, nice to meet you

183
00:22:23,278 --> 00:22:26,278
Today's Hiroshima has changed.

184
00:22:26,583 --> 00:22:28,083
Do you know about Atomic bomb?

185
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:30,310
I don't know.
i was not born

186
00:22:31,322 --> 00:22:34,564
Children who do not know about the atomic bomb are growing up

187
00:22:35,197 --> 00:22:40,158
People who talk about the atomic bomb now are very strange.

188
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:41,689
I know

189
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:43,822
I don't care no one concern about it

190
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,915
There're many bars

191
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:25,899
There are many branches of various companies in Hiroshima.

192
00:23:25,924 --> 00:23:26,579
You mean?

193
00:23:26,752 --> 00:23:29,531
 The more companies, the more bars

194
00:23:31,438 --> 00:23:32,501
How about here

195
00:23:36,235 --> 00:23:37,360
Welcome

196
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:38,415
Welcome

197
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,852
did you come from narita airport?

198
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:41,594
Yeah

199
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,243
It seems that the baseball game was interesting today

200
00:23:44,329 --> 00:23:48,805
Hiroshima Toyo Carp is very strong when they have home game

201
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,087
That's funny

202
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:54,907
you are much more beautiful than before

203
00:23:55,587 --> 00:23:57,087
Thank you very much

204
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:57,829
You got a boyfriend?

205
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,391
How do you know?

206
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:03,055
Love makes a woman beautiful

207
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:06,313
If you want to be beautiful, you should fall in love

208
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:09,782
No one loves me unfortunately

209
00:24:09,807 --> 00:24:10,860
How about me?

210
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,266
No way

211
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,860
Why?

212
00:24:12,938 --> 00:24:14,594
Because...

213
00:24:15,337 --> 00:24:16,188
How dare you

214
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,188
What do you drink?

215
00:24:17,337 --> 00:24:19,313
Give me a beer anyway

216
00:24:21,337 --> 00:24:24,032
Do you like night life in Hiroshima?

217
00:24:24,438 --> 00:24:26,798
Why don't you change seat?

218
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:28,969
Let's change

219
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,149
She's the Madam

220
00:24:47,393 --> 00:24:48,166
You know him?

221
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:49,439
Yeah I met him today

222
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:51,611
Is he regular customer?

223
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,478
I don't think so

224
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:56,580
He's here to watch Madam

225
00:24:57,213 --> 00:25:00,643
What are you guys talking about?
You are one of them

226
00:25:01,439 --> 00:25:03,252

She is so beautiful

230
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,549
As far as I know, She is the most beautiful woman in Hiroshima

231
00:25:13,768 --> 00:25:15,260

232
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:18,626

00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:13,053

255
00:26:13,155 --> 00:26:14,920

00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:39,684
Sounds like you had the deepest conversation

263
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:41,028
Don't get us wrong

264
00:26:41,098 --> 00:26:41,989
Welcome

265
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:44,301
Come here

266
00:26:47,361 --> 00:26:48,853
I heard you came from Tokyo

267
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:49,931
i arrived this morning

268
00:26:50,064 --> 00:26:51,111
Do you come here often?

269
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,299
This is my first visit

270
00:26:53,525 --> 00:26:55,330
Thank you very much

271
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,619
Are you bored here?

272
00:26:58,712 --> 00:27:00,563
i just got here so i don't know yet

273
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:08,283
17 years after the atomic bomb was dropped, he thought that there would be some kind of evidence again, so he is interviewing here.

274
00:27:08,316 --> 00:27:09,861
I see

275
00:27:11,996 --> 00:27:18,534
There is no other way than to interview the atomic bomb survivors in the materials of the Atomic Bomb Museum or in the hospital.

276
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,730
Let's enjoy alcohol without talking about work

277
00:27:22,456 --> 00:27:23,034
Yeah

278
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,308
beer is not alcohol

279
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:25,691
Bring me whiskey on the rock

280
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,214
Give me high ball

281
00:27:27,239 --> 00:27:28,160

282
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:32,581

00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:36,410
I'm alright
Where's Madam?

284
00:27:37,292 --> 00:27:37,863

I give you

287
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,417
Don't be shy

288
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,536
Oh my god

289
00:27:50,607 --> 00:27:52,255
I'm sorry

290
00:27:52,786 --> 00:27:53,997
What the hell?

291
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:56,997
I'm sorry.
Let's go

292
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,391
He's so bad

293
00:27:59,618 --> 00:28:01,102
Pass me the towel

294
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,336
Clean here

295
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:04,493
I'm sorry.

296
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:06,954
I'm alright

297
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:10,513
When he gets drunk, he behaves badly

298
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,248
Mama

299
00:28:13,795 --> 00:28:15,490
I'm busy

300
00:28:16,643 --> 00:28:18,213
I was sorry

301
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:19,252
What the hell?

302
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:21,096
Let's go

303
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,814
What's wrong?

304
00:28:24,049 --> 00:28:24,908
Let's go out

305
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,119
I'm busy

306
00:28:26,144 --> 00:28:27,916
Please listen to me

307
00:28:28,627 --> 00:28:29,565
What's that?

308
00:28:29,744 --> 00:28:31,002
Who's he?

309
00:28:32,057 --> 00:28:34,432
he looks like a journalist from some magazine

310
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:36,573
He's chasing her

311
00:28:36,729 --> 00:28:37,744
He is still young

312
00:28:38,377 --> 00:28:39,526
He wants her money

313
00:28:39,713 --> 00:28:40,994
What do you mean?

314
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,666
You are still kid

315
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:45,119
Let's go out

316
00:28:45,393 --> 00:28:46,776
Go home

317
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:48,533

325
00:29:04,879 --> 00:29:06,098
Will you come here again

326
00:29:06,123 --> 00:29:07,238

To ABCC Hijiyama

330
00:29:50,786 --> 00:29:56,880
abcc Atomic Bomb Cure Association does not provide treatment

331
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,395
They are funded by the U.S. Defense Department and monitor healers on a long-term basis.

332
00:30:02,692 --> 00:30:06,856
They learned the relief method for combatants at the time of the atomic bombing.

333
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:10,028
They are also doing genetic research on radioactivity

334
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,319
abcc does not treat

335
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,280
Good timing,let's take that taxi

336
00:30:22,616 --> 00:30:23,233

337

00:30:30,421 --> 00:30:32,585
I'll leave first

342
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:33,343
See you

343
00:30:33,764 --> 00:30:34,968
See you

344
00:30:38,142 --> 00:30:39,017
To station

345
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,227
Take care

346
00:30:52,454 --> 00:30:53,384
Are you alright?

347
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:56,962
Were you in ABCC?

348
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,712
I'm just here to collect the money.

349
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:11,507
The scenery from here is wonderful

350
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:12,202
Yeah

351
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,159
Hiroshima has changed

352
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:21,425
That's right

353
00:31:29,117 --> 00:31:31,203
Did you finish your work?

354
00:31:32,659 --> 00:31:34,417
It's hard

355
00:31:34,612 --> 00:31:35,862
I know it's hard

356
00:31:36,901 --> 00:31:38,620
Did you find something?

357
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:46,753
As far as I can see, the Atomic Bomb Museum and DOME have no pride in the atomic bombing.

358
00:31:47,862 --> 00:31:49,948
It's been 17 years

359
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:52,221
Were you in Hiroshima at that time?

360
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:54,850
Why you ask me?

361
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:56,428
Well..nothing

362
00:31:57,131 --> 00:31:58,967
Where is Kusunoki city?

363
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:01,959
I think it's on the north side of the castle

364
00:32:01,992 --> 00:32:06,795
It seems that there is a mother of a baby with six fingers

365
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:10,248
I plan to go see her after abcc

366
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,910
what are you going to do looking for that person?

367
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,636
I'm a journalist, so I'd like to make sure

368
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,605
It's cruel

369
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:25,379
This is my work

370
00:32:26,285 --> 00:32:28,394
what do you do to make sure?

371
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:34,682
It's a journalist's job to report new medical conditions after 17 years

372
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:38,838
I have to visit somewhere, see you

373
00:32:39,025 --> 00:32:39,564
Hold on

374
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:22,587
Excuse me. May I ask you something?

375
00:33:23,259 --> 00:33:25,603
I'm looking for Yamada around here

376
00:33:25,767 --> 00:33:26,907
Yamada?

377
00:33:27,696 --> 00:33:29,079
That Yamada

378
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,806
she moved a while ago

379
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:33,860
To where?

380
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:37,915
I have no idea.
Do you know?

381
00:33:41,301 --> 00:33:47,113
Well...Kuniko Yamada is divorced from Yuji Yamada

382
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:48,751
divorced ?

383
00:33:49,243 --> 00:33:51,548
She back to Kuniko Seto now

384
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:29,409
Kuniko Seto?

385
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,675
I know her

386
00:34:32,456 --> 00:34:37,831
She worked for only two months, so I'm not sure.

387
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,224
Sugata might know about her

388
00:34:41,591 --> 00:34:42,919
They were good friend

389
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:44,474
Can I see her?

390
00:34:44,974 --> 00:34:47,005
She is absent now

391
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:50,533
she said she was going to the sea

392
00:35:03,146 --> 00:35:04,263
Come on

393
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:54,272
Where's my order?

394
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,397
What did you say?

395
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,319
Where's my order?

396
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,088
I'm cooking it now

397
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:04,924
Don't watch TV and make it quickly

398
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,615
Please make the customer's curry quickly

399
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:34,504
there are no customers

400
00:38:34,886 --> 00:38:36,465
Saturday always like this

401
00:38:37,488 --> 00:38:40,285
Welcome.
Are you alone?

402
00:38:40,769 --> 00:38:42,597
Mama was here just before

403
00:38:42,676 --> 00:38:43,386
She's not here?

404
00:38:44,004 --> 00:38:46,310
She has something to do.
You're unlucky

405
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,303
Where is she gone?

406
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:49,795
I have no idea
Do you know?

407
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,373
No

408
00:38:54,053 --> 00:38:56,084
I will go back to Tokyo tomorrow night

409
00:38:58,264 --> 00:38:59,420
This bar is closed on Sundays?

410
00:39:00,936 --> 00:39:02,975
Can you extend your stay by one day?

411
00:39:03,084 --> 00:39:04,108
I can't

412
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,076
Say hi to her

413
00:39:07,248 --> 00:39:09,311
To whom? Mama?

414
00:39:11,505 --> 00:39:15,045
you love her without me knowing

415
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,560
Don't get me wrong

416
00:39:20,428 --> 00:39:23,740
Hi, We are Aki, yes he is here

417
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,732
From Kikuta

418
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:41,381
She always disappears every Saturday

419
00:39:41,717 --> 00:39:42,444
What?

420
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:48,320
no one knows where she's going

421
00:39:48,648 --> 00:39:51,413
i think she is with that man

422
00:39:51,601 --> 00:39:52,359
Who?

423
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:56,757
It's the man who poured alcohol on you

424
00:39:57,265 --> 00:40:00,015
Oh that guy.
I can't believe

425
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:04,534
How old is she?

426
00:40:05,307 --> 00:40:06,190
Why?

427
00:40:06,761 --> 00:40:09,261
is she married?

428
00:40:09,815 --> 00:40:13,307
I have no idea.
she said she wasn't married

429
00:40:14,661 --> 00:40:16,779
let's drink a lot tonight

430
00:40:17,535 --> 00:40:19,614
No way.
I am very tired from walking around all day today.

431
00:40:19,639 --> 00:40:24,286
Are you disappointed because you don't have a girlfriend?

432
00:40:24,311 --> 00:40:26,936
alcohol takes away your tier

433
00:40:31,002 --> 00:40:34,448
Thank you for waiting

434
00:40:35,331 --> 00:40:37,018
You don't work today?

435
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:39,206
I will go to work late today

436
00:40:40,803 --> 00:40:44,452
Did you find a baby with six fingers?

437
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:47,038
I have a hard time finding his mother

438
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:50,063
I have bad luck

439
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:54,875
don't be disappointed.
It's so hard to find what kind of things now

440
00:40:55,291 --> 00:41:00,494
If you think Hiroshima has a problem, I think you have a problem yourself.

441
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,299
Since we came all the way here, why don't we go to Miyajima tomorrow?

442
00:41:09,416 --> 00:41:11,127
I can go with you

443
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:13,205
Oh yeah

444
00:41:14,049 --> 00:41:15,814
What's wrong?

445
00:41:15,955 --> 00:41:17,807
Drink more

446
00:41:34,267 --> 00:41:37,353
Hello? Yes connect me

447
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:41,298
Editorial office?

448
00:41:42,584 --> 00:41:44,897
I'm Kamiya, where's desk?

449
00:41:46,491 --> 00:41:48,303
I'm Kamiya,

450
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:54,037
I have covered a lot of ground, but I can't do this project, so can we cancel it?

451
00:41:57,146 --> 00:42:00,310
I know I know but

452
00:42:00,732 --> 00:42:06,193
There is nothing left in Hiroshima today.

453
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,052
this project is too old fashion

454
00:42:12,216 --> 00:42:13,513
I get it

455
00:42:14,153 --> 00:42:17,825
I'll go back tomorrow’s train

456
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:19,817
See you

457
00:43:23,427 --> 00:43:26,029
Hello?

458
00:43:28,365 --> 00:43:29,146
Hello?

459
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:46,732
Hello?
A stranger is sleeping in my bed. Please come

460
00:43:56,938 --> 00:43:57,758
Excuse me

461
00:43:57,914 --> 00:44:00,485
I took shower and she was sleeping

462
00:44:00,649 --> 00:44:03,071
It seems door was unlocked

463
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:05,489
Excuse me

464
00:44:07,801 --> 00:44:09,544
Hello?

465
00:44:10,106 --> 00:44:11,270
Hello?

466
00:44:13,463 --> 00:44:17,584
She got wrong room. her room is 317

467
00:44:17,811 --> 00:44:19,874
I'll call her friend

468
00:44:31,576 --> 00:44:33,319
She is troublesome

469
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:35,881
Help me

470
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:39,123
Damn it

471
00:44:54,909 --> 00:44:56,792
Good night

472
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,682
This is tip for you

473
00:45:02,854 --> 00:45:03,870
Thank you very much

474
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:12,941
I’ll clean your bed

475
00:45:13,128 --> 00:45:14,003
It's ok

476
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:14,901
Good night

477
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,250
Hello? Oh you

478
00:45:33,718 --> 00:45:36,461
That baby is in Akitsu

479
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:38,461
What? Akitsu?

480
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:45,268
I've never been there.
The town is famous for Sake

481
00:45:45,791 --> 00:45:49,346
My friend there told me

482
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:53,768
You were disappointed so I helped you

483
00:45:55,244 --> 00:45:56,971
I'm sure

484
00:46:18,853 --> 00:46:22,580
Well..The baby was died

485
00:46:25,445 --> 00:46:27,305
She was dead

486
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:33,609
A year ago she died of pneumonia.

487
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,506
Where's her mom?

488
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:40,631
I wanna see Kuniko

489
00:46:40,656 --> 00:46:42,006
Why you wanna see her?

490
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:43,944
I want to ask her something

491
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,826
What you will ask her?

492
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,037
I won't give you trouble

493
00:46:49,195 --> 00:46:51,289


494
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,983
You reporter?
Go home

495
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:57,656
You're sick.
Stay in bed

496
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,476
Stop it

497
00:46:59,582 --> 00:47:03,973
You ask about babies for fun.

498
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,988
I don't mean that

499
00:47:06,013 --> 00:47:09,410
So Why you are here?

500
00:47:09,873 --> 00:47:12,819
Don't give her trouble anymore

501
00:47:13,834 --> 00:47:15,529
You're sick.
Stay in bed

502
00:47:16,272 --> 00:47:18,475
I'm sorry.
You came here all the way

503
00:47:19,025 --> 00:47:21,165
I'm sorry.

504
00:48:15,855 --> 00:48:16,589
Hi

505
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:34,478
Why you are here?

506
00:48:35,243 --> 00:48:36,368
I wasted time

507
00:48:36,393 --> 00:48:37,228
For what?

508
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:40,539
You're strange

509
00:48:41,032 --> 00:48:42,501
You stayed here last night?

510
00:48:43,017 --> 00:48:47,032
I can't do anything bad.
Why you are here too?

511
00:48:48,891 --> 00:48:51,118
I'm here for finding the baby

512
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,516
She was dead so I can't do anything now

513
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,407
I see
Where are you going?

514
00:49:01,586 --> 00:49:02,946
Shall I guide you?

515
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,821
You're good at kidding

516
00:49:04,852 --> 00:49:06,954
So you can go alone

517
00:49:08,188 --> 00:49:08,688
To where?

518
00:49:09,141 --> 00:49:10,508
My hotel

519
00:49:11,258 --> 00:49:12,594
I will bother you

520
00:49:12,758 --> 00:49:14,125
It's ok

521
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,385
It's strange

522
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,260
For what?

523
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:18,307
Because

524
00:49:18,463 --> 00:49:21,572
You get me wrong

525
00:49:21,877 --> 00:49:24,658
You can come with me

526
00:49:47,044 --> 00:49:48,426
Here

527
00:50:05,907 --> 00:50:07,189
Come in

528
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:19,303
Come in

529
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,258
Take off your jacket

530
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:35,190
Take off your tie

531
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:40,472
Take off your shirts too

532
00:50:42,325 --> 00:50:44,364
I can't

533
00:50:44,544 --> 00:50:45,872
It's ok

534
00:50:48,872 --> 00:50:50,216
Excuse me

535
00:50:52,812 --> 00:50:54,492
You're sweaty

536
00:51:01,978 --> 00:51:02,752
Oh yeah

537
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:07,158
I know you smoke

538
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:09,314
Thank you very much

539
00:51:28,931 --> 00:51:30,040
Thank you very much

540
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:34,712
The owner here is my friend.
I come here every weekend

541
00:51:35,181 --> 00:51:36,251
Here it is

542
00:51:37,509 --> 00:51:41,462
you don't have to hide it

543
00:51:41,572 --> 00:51:44,033
No one believes me when I tell the truth

544
00:51:44,173 --> 00:51:47,908
I'm too lazy to explain every time

545
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,609
Welcome

546
00:51:55,898 --> 00:51:57,312
Sorry I'm like this

547
00:51:58,054 --> 00:52:00,523
It's ok. It's summer

548
00:52:00,703 --> 00:52:01,851
Please make yourself at home

549
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,961
She's owner

550
00:52:03,539 --> 00:52:05,508
Thanks for coming

551
00:52:05,533 --> 00:52:06,945
He's kamiya

552
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,344
I met you at Hijiyama yesterday

553
00:52:10,664 --> 00:52:13,976
you haven't had lunch yet?
Shall I order Sushi?

554
00:52:14,195 --> 00:52:15,031
Yeah

555
00:52:15,234 --> 00:52:17,219
Please order

556
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:19,687
Please make yourself at home

557
00:52:19,712 --> 00:52:22,578
bring me a bigger towel

558
00:52:22,603 --> 00:52:23,984
Ok that's better

559
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:25,390
Don't worry

560
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:30,664
why was she there?

561
00:52:31,101 --> 00:52:32,218
ABCC?

562
00:52:32,726 --> 00:52:33,609
is she an atomic bomb survivor?

563
00:52:33,867 --> 00:52:35,656
Yes but it's not serious

564
00:52:36,125 --> 00:52:38,656
She's your classmate

565
00:52:39,109 --> 00:52:40,445
So you were in Hiroshima at the time

566
00:52:40,554 --> 00:52:42,883
You should take a rest

567
00:52:42,908 --> 00:52:44,773
i bring a pillow

568
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:46,101
Don't worry

569
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,773
Please make yourself at home

570
00:52:47,798 --> 00:52:49,219
That's not so you

571
00:52:49,304 --> 00:52:49,914
Why?

572
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,992
you are a journalist

573
00:52:52,031 --> 00:52:56,594
i have nothing to do with the job now

574
00:52:56,726 --> 00:52:58,344
Please

575
00:52:58,617 --> 00:53:00,094
You serve me a lot

576
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:02,234
You should take a rest

577
00:53:08,656 --> 00:53:09,702
I feel good

578
00:53:09,727 --> 00:53:12,117
You are so sweaty

579
00:53:14,851 --> 00:53:17,617
Shall I prepare the bed?

580
00:53:18,453 --> 00:53:20,047
Don't worry

581
00:53:20,249 --> 00:53:22,538
Please make yourself at home

582
00:53:22,617 --> 00:53:25,148
Please order Sushi

583
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:27,851
I will order

584
00:53:35,736 --> 00:53:37,540
i look sick

585
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,954
you are curious sick

586
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:44,690
It's cold

587
00:54:21,164 --> 00:54:26,766
I have no idea what kind of person you are

588
00:54:27,548 --> 00:54:28,580
Same here

589
00:54:29,197 --> 00:54:31,627
I want to know more about you

590
00:54:32,705 --> 00:54:37,048
what your life is like in your past and now

591
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:38,447
because you are a journalist?

592
00:54:38,947 --> 00:54:42,587
please don't mislead me

593
00:54:43,557 --> 00:54:44,627
I really wanna know

594
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:50,252
It's better if we don't know anything about each other

595
00:54:50,814 --> 00:54:53,377
I'm happy now

596
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,174
i won't be happy anytime soon

597
00:54:57,275 --> 00:54:59,018
you are greedy

598
00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:01,228
It could be

599
00:55:02,572 --> 00:55:08,588
But I don't want to leave without anyone knowing

600
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:15,385
I have to go back to Tokyo tomorrow

601
00:55:16,072 --> 00:55:18,463
It's a pity that we became good friends

602
00:55:19,150 --> 00:55:20,033
So

603
00:55:25,898 --> 00:55:27,109
I want

604
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:30,828
If you go back to Tokyo, you will be busy with work.

605
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:33,039
Why you say that?

606
00:55:35,508 --> 00:55:37,367
Stop it

607
00:55:53,086 --> 00:55:54,032
Are you alright?

608
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:56,446
Please lay down

609
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,938
you are anemic.
I’ll get some medicine

610
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:12,024
I'm alright

611
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:14,399
Don't worry

612
00:56:16,305 --> 00:56:17,485
I was sorry

613
00:56:18,883 --> 00:56:21,188
You bully me

614
00:56:25,702 --> 00:56:26,998
I worried

615
00:56:29,373 --> 00:56:30,928
Stop here

616
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:33,248
In front of the hotel

617
00:56:33,608 --> 00:56:34,881
I'll send you

618
00:56:34,906 --> 00:56:36,131
Don't worry

619
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:50,675
Take care

620
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,386
Good night

621
00:57:12,272 --> 00:57:13,498
Welcome back

622
00:57:16,354 --> 00:57:18,823
we have booked your train ticket

623
00:57:19,971 --> 00:57:20,807
Thank you very much

624
00:57:22,049 --> 00:57:23,315
Good night

625
00:57:25,013 --> 00:57:28,864
Can I reserve a ticket for the train at 9 o'clock tomorrow night?

626
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,927
Asakaze train?

627
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,207
I think it's too late

628
00:57:33,247 --> 00:57:34,052
I'm in trouble

629
00:57:34,122 --> 00:57:35,302
Excuse me

630
00:57:36,598 --> 00:57:38,606
I'll give you this if you like

631
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,239
Are you alright?

632
00:57:40,513 --> 00:57:41,004
You don't need ?

633
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:41,973
I'm alright

634
00:57:43,723 --> 00:57:45,887
He's so kind

635
00:59:08,406 --> 00:59:10,210
I'm going now

636
00:59:10,235 --> 00:59:11,429
Good morning

637
00:59:14,711 --> 00:59:16,868
Good morning

638
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:22,165
Mama

639
00:59:27,305 --> 00:59:28,227
You're here

640
00:59:28,594 --> 00:59:30,110
You're cold

641
00:59:30,135 --> 00:59:30,922
What can I do for you?

642
00:59:32,759 --> 00:59:33,181
Again?

643
00:59:33,657 --> 00:59:36,735
I borrowed money from a friend, but I spent it all.

644
00:59:37,126 --> 00:59:39,516
Please help me

645
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:41,453
It can't be helped

646
00:59:42,945 --> 00:59:44,492
Good morning

647
00:59:45,289 --> 00:59:47,313
I'm going out for dinner

648
00:59:50,234 --> 00:59:52,234
How much you need?

649
00:59:55,382 --> 00:59:57,249
50000yen is enough

650
00:59:57,398 --> 01:00:00,953
Good morning.
Sorry I'm late

651
01:00:01,195 --> 01:00:02,406
Good morning

652
01:00:02,992 --> 01:00:06,781
Thank you very much.
Let's have drink together

653
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:08,117
I'm busy tonight

654
01:00:08,142 --> 01:00:09,914
Let's have drink together

655
01:00:12,078 --> 01:00:13,476
Go away

656
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:19,913
Good morning

657
01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:40,078
Good night

658
01:00:41,547 --> 01:00:43,641
It's been a age

659
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:44,250
Madam is here?

660
01:00:44,275 --> 01:00:46,758
Yes, please come in

661
01:01:00,001 --> 01:01:01,626
Welcome

662
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:04,251
have a seat

663
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:09,861
Excuse me

664
01:01:13,103 --> 01:01:15,376
Didn't you go back to Tokyo?

665
01:01:17,736 --> 01:01:19,189
Are you alright?

666
01:01:20,736 --> 01:01:23,509
Why didn't you go back to Tokyo?

667
01:01:24,212 --> 01:01:29,790
I thought I'd go home without seeing you, but I changed my mind.

668
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:34,290
Can you go out?

669
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:37,954
After work, ok

670
01:01:39,314 --> 01:01:41,775
Welcome

671
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:47,983
Welcome

672
01:01:48,351 --> 01:01:49,007
Where's Kaneko?

673
01:01:49,032 --> 01:01:50,319
Over there

674
01:01:53,698 --> 01:01:55,652
you were waiting for me?

675
01:01:56,370 --> 01:01:57,269
Excuse me

676
01:02:13,381 --> 01:02:15,483
Do you want another beer?

677
01:02:17,265 --> 01:02:18,733
Serve him beer

678
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,186
Excuse me

679
01:02:29,422 --> 01:02:30,445
What's wrong?

680
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:40,649
you borrowed money from that woman?

681
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:41,641
Yeah

682
01:02:41,906 --> 01:02:43,594
you borrowed money from that woman?

683
01:02:43,781 --> 01:02:44,399
Yeah

684
01:02:44,656 --> 01:02:45,719
You're kidding

685
01:02:45,953 --> 01:02:47,321
It's true

686
01:02:47,938 --> 01:02:49,313
i won't be stupid

687
01:02:49,571 --> 01:02:52,336
why don't you trust me?

688
01:02:57,137 --> 01:02:58,723
Give me water

689
01:03:17,014 --> 01:03:18,733
What's wrong?

690
01:03:18,858 --> 01:03:19,670
You go home

691
01:03:19,748 --> 01:03:21,834
Ok I'll wait for you

692
01:03:21,959 --> 01:03:22,983
Bye

693
01:03:29,203 --> 01:03:30,898
Why you upset?

694
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,718
you don't have to worry about her

695
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:39,500
You didn't care about me so I played with her a little

696
01:03:41,062 --> 01:03:45,281
you are always busy

697
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,258
I was lonely

698
01:03:48,367 --> 01:03:49,281
Mom

699
01:03:49,306 --> 01:03:50,359
What are you talking about?

700
01:03:51,117 --> 01:03:57,257
I was so worried about you because you don't have parents

701
01:03:57,282 --> 01:03:57,828
So

702
01:03:57,853 --> 01:03:59,273
don't rely me too much

703
01:03:59,876 --> 01:04:01,314
You go home

704
01:04:02,533 --> 01:04:03,204
What's the hell?

705
01:04:07,228 --> 01:04:09,087
Get away

706
01:04:09,493 --> 01:04:13,306
I am one of the customers
you are nagging her

707
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:14,548
one of the customers?

708
01:04:15,533 --> 01:04:17,994
You are new here

709
01:04:18,681 --> 01:04:21,291
You just act cool

710
01:04:21,424 --> 01:04:23,447
What? you act cool

711
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:25,095
Stop it

712
01:04:25,509 --> 01:04:27,049
He look me down

713
01:04:27,283 --> 01:04:28,424
What's wrong?

714
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:31,493
What's the hell?

715
01:04:31,518 --> 01:04:32,423
Stop it

716
01:04:32,962 --> 01:04:34,360
You go home

717
01:04:35,064 --> 01:04:36,001
What's the hell?

718
01:04:36,026 --> 01:04:37,017
Who are you guys?

719
01:04:37,042 --> 01:04:39,290
Mind your mouth

720
01:04:39,315 --> 01:04:41,501
What's the hell?

721
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:43,884
You hit me

722
01:04:45,851 --> 01:04:47,359
Go outside

723
01:04:50,413 --> 01:04:51,804
Stop it

724
01:04:52,531 --> 01:04:54,007
Calm down

725
01:04:54,835 --> 01:04:56,445
You go home

726
01:04:58,002 --> 01:04:59,041
Are you alright?

727
01:04:59,072 --> 01:05:00,478
I'm alright

728
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:05,812
you are bothering me
You go home

729
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,234
Sorry, we will just drink

730
01:05:08,259 --> 01:05:09,922
You're too bad

731
01:05:11,236 --> 01:05:12,798
I was sorry

732
01:05:12,823 --> 01:05:14,470
What's wrong?

733
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:16,962
It's nothing

734
01:05:18,946 --> 01:05:20,149
Where's Kamiya?

735
01:05:20,188 --> 01:05:22,633
He's just left

736
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,993
Welcome

737
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,492
Welcome back

738
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:51,970
Welcome back

739
01:05:55,626 --> 01:05:56,485
Kamiya-san

740
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:02,126
What's wrong?

741
01:06:02,478 --> 01:06:03,548
I need to talk with you

742
01:06:03,915 --> 01:06:06,134
Me?
Thank you

743
01:06:06,189 --> 01:06:08,861
Where have you been?
I was waiting for long time

744
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:11,376
i was drinking in some bars

745
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:18,474
I'm here to say sorry

746
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,818
I'm alright

747
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:35,799
shall we take a walk outside?
I’m going to change clothes

748
01:06:55,557 --> 01:06:59,784
what kind of relationship does that man have with you?

749
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:01,674
Nothing

750
01:07:02,745 --> 01:07:06,245
I have seen them stay together in a hotel

751
01:07:06,964 --> 01:07:08,526
i happened to see it

752
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:12,503
He's play boy

753
01:07:13,089 --> 01:07:15,534
I have nothing to do with him now

754
01:07:15,917 --> 01:07:16,909
What do you mean?

755
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:19,807
a lot happens in my job

756
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:25,111
But he was always lonely

757
01:07:25,783 --> 01:07:27,651
that's why he depends on me

758
01:07:27,799 --> 01:07:29,291
So you are...

759
01:07:30,541 --> 01:07:36,322
We were drunk so I don't remember anything..so we slept together

760
01:07:38,432 --> 01:07:40,729
You are lonely too

761
01:07:41,705 --> 01:07:42,455
Kind of

762
01:07:43,979 --> 01:07:46,736
You were too lonely

763
01:07:47,697 --> 01:07:48,901
i understand your feelings

764
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,138
Akiko?

765
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:02,028
you have a very pure heart

766
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:05,341
now i know about it

767
01:08:19,785 --> 01:08:23,832
i feel like i understand you

768
01:08:24,785 --> 01:08:26,035
You are lonely

769
01:08:28,199 --> 01:08:31,332
I want to help you if you want

770
01:08:33,191 --> 01:08:36,800
I really wanna help you

771
01:08:53,636 --> 01:08:54,464
Excuse me

772
01:09:25,229 --> 01:09:26,072
What are you doing?

773
01:09:31,963 --> 01:09:33,221
Put your hand out

774
01:09:39,894 --> 01:09:40,581
What's this?

775
01:09:40,855 --> 01:09:41,769
Hold it

776
01:09:52,808 --> 01:09:53,347
What's this?

777
01:09:53,816 --> 01:10:00,668
The stone is at the bottom of the river at high tide

778
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:04,021
At low tide the stone appears

779
01:10:06,216 --> 01:10:10,661
The tide was ebb at the time of the atomic bombing

780
01:10:13,592 --> 01:10:16,155
Is this the effect of the atomic bomb?

781
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,767
There are many stones like this in Hiroshima.

782
01:10:24,361 --> 01:10:25,595
This is Hiroshima stone

783
01:10:28,251 --> 01:10:31,900
why did you give me this stone?

784
01:11:09,206 --> 01:11:10,588
Please make yourself at home

785
01:11:11,979 --> 01:11:15,253
If you have any business, please ring the bell over there.

786
01:11:24,023 --> 01:11:27,688
It's quiet here so we can talk

787
01:11:28,797 --> 01:11:33,031
why are you interested in me?

788
01:11:38,311 --> 01:11:42,975
because i like you.
That's all

789
01:11:45,526 --> 01:11:47,893
Have a seat.
Wanna drink?

790
01:11:53,307 --> 01:11:55,221
do you doubt me?

791
01:12:00,629 --> 01:12:03,184
Because of my job, it may be unavoidable

792
01:12:06,970 --> 01:12:08,782
do you think all men are playboys?

793
01:12:09,118 --> 01:12:10,048
No

794
01:12:11,087 --> 01:12:14,399
What do you mean?

795
01:12:17,383 --> 01:12:20,844
I really love you

796
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:23,180
You hate me?

797
01:12:23,563 --> 01:12:26,172
You know how I feel

798
01:12:26,328 --> 01:12:26,805
So?

799
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:30,055
I'm sure you'll regret it

800
01:12:30,703 --> 01:12:34,039
i will never regret

801
01:12:37,175 --> 01:12:38,355
Hold on

802
01:12:38,393 --> 01:12:40,355
you don't understand me

803
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:41,832
It's none of my business

804
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,941
Hold on

805
01:13:13,899 --> 01:13:14,766
Open the door

806
01:14:48,327 --> 01:14:51,186
I was a student at that time

807
01:14:52,546 --> 01:14:57,507
I lived in the suburbs of Hiroshima and was hit by the atomic bomb on my way to a temple.

808
01:15:00,286 --> 01:15:06,328
Then I feel very insecure about my health

809
01:15:06,617 --> 01:15:10,727
I’m always so insecure about myself

810
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,821
I don't want female happiness

811
01:15:21,985 --> 01:15:27,289
After I graduated, my parents died and I started working at a company.

812
01:15:28,133 --> 01:15:29,578
I also worked as a housekeeper

813
01:15:30,985 --> 01:15:34,219
and now I’m doing this job

814
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:41,327
many men seduce me

815
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:50,014
I'm a woman, so I want to rely on men sometime

816
01:15:54,267 --> 01:15:57,587
but my body won't let it

817
01:15:58,970 --> 01:16:02,814
men see my body and run away.
I’m worried of it

818
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:11,049
Now you know how I am

819
01:16:15,393 --> 01:16:17,386
I’m like a stone in Hiroshima

820
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:30,174
No one sees the stones at the bottom of the river because people see the blue sky during the day and the neon lights at night.

821
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:36,460
you get it?

822
01:16:43,494 --> 01:16:44,205
Where are you going?

823
01:16:44,853 --> 01:16:48,213
I'm going home.
See you

824
01:16:48,595 --> 01:16:49,923
Don't go

825
01:16:51,563 --> 01:16:52,321
You can't go home

826
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:52,970
Let me go

827
01:16:53,142 --> 01:16:54,580
Stay here

828
01:16:58,410 --> 01:17:03,387
No matter how is your body. I love you all the way

829
01:17:04,551 --> 01:17:05,926
 I love you

830
01:17:05,980 --> 01:17:08,613
I can't believe it

831
01:17:09,582 --> 01:17:13,168
Let's get married.
I will protect you

832
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:16,869
I will heel your disease

833
01:17:17,447 --> 01:17:18,837
We can't

834
01:17:19,197 --> 01:17:20,650
I can't believe it

835
01:17:21,744 --> 01:17:23,369
I can't believe

836
01:17:23,728 --> 01:17:24,611
You can't?

837
01:17:25,494 --> 01:17:28,064
Not you but...

838
01:17:29,587 --> 01:17:30,267
Akiko

839
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:35,712
Let's get married.

840
01:17:38,501 --> 01:17:43,087
No..
We can't get married

841
01:17:43,112 --> 01:17:46,322
Stay strong

842
01:17:46,931 --> 01:17:48,705
I want to help you

843
01:17:48,908 --> 01:17:52,150
You'll regret

844
01:17:52,306 --> 01:17:53,033
Stay strong

845
01:17:56,205 --> 01:18:00,954
I wanna make you happy

846
01:18:01,712 --> 01:18:03,759
You'll regret

847
01:18:05,251 --> 01:18:09,728
I love you all the way.
Your unhappy is my unhappy

848
01:18:10,377 --> 01:18:14,025
Your happiness is my happiness

849
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:35,143
Let's go to Tokyo with me tonight.
This is our best way

850
01:18:37,432 --> 01:18:38,377
Can you?

851
01:18:41,446 --> 01:18:43,485
I won't leave from you

852
01:18:45,516 --> 01:18:51,313
If you are sick and dying, use my love as a springboard to live the rest of your life.

853
01:18:52,969 --> 01:18:54,750
I will willing to support you

854
01:18:57,782 --> 01:18:59,040
Can you?

855
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:01,336
Can you?

856
01:19:05,443 --> 01:19:11,936
Thanks. I will buy a ticket for you at the station

857
01:19:14,446 --> 01:19:15,477
You sure to come?

858
01:19:17,422 --> 01:19:18,000
Yes

859
01:19:27,718 --> 01:19:29,226
You gonna get married?

860
01:19:31,945 --> 01:19:36,945
I think you know about yourself very much

861
01:19:38,187 --> 01:19:40,273
So I'm here to consult you

862
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:49,250
I can't say no.. and I can't recommend

863
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:54,791
I always tell you about your health

864
01:19:56,549 --> 01:20:00,322
I don't know what's going on your health

865
01:20:02,697 --> 01:20:07,447
I can't against to you

866
01:20:08,805 --> 01:20:12,133
Sudden increase in white blood cells may occur

867
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:23,915
But this is your happiness..so I can't say anything as a doctor

868
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,750
Kamiya

869
01:21:13,109 --> 01:21:14,180
Thanks for waiting

870
01:21:14,211 --> 01:21:16,836
I thought you wouldn’t come

871
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:19,121
Excuse me

872
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,051
One entrance ticket

873
01:21:24,518 --> 01:21:26,784
What?
I've bought your ticket

874
01:21:28,682 --> 01:21:29,440
Where's your baggage?

875
01:21:29,565 --> 01:21:30,268
I don't have

876
01:21:30,293 --> 01:21:30,870
no?

877
01:21:31,659 --> 01:21:32,487
Let's go

878
01:21:38,788 --> 01:21:41,272
Akiko

879
01:21:43,621 --> 01:21:44,629
What happened?

880
01:21:46,512 --> 01:21:48,058
I'll say good bye here

881
01:21:48,762 --> 01:21:49,223
Why?

882
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,418
I can't go after all

883
01:21:53,291 --> 01:21:55,869
We have time.
Let's talk

884
01:21:57,971 --> 01:22:00,783
You worry about your health?

885
01:22:00,808 --> 01:22:01,564
No

886
01:22:03,410 --> 01:22:05,058
why did you suddenly change your mind?

887
01:22:05,988 --> 01:22:08,285
Let me think more

888
01:22:09,003 --> 01:22:10,441
I need to think

889
01:22:10,730 --> 01:22:13,761
Think?
You just follow me, ok

890
01:22:16,384 --> 01:22:19,361
This memory is enough for me

891
01:22:20,642 --> 01:22:22,220
I was happy

892
01:22:23,041 --> 01:22:25,509
Anyway, we're splitting here today

893
01:22:29,299 --> 01:22:32,096
I won't leave

894
01:22:45,971 --> 01:22:51,971
I won't give up, so please wait until I come to pick you up

895
01:22:53,276 --> 01:22:54,143
I'm sure to pick you up

896
01:23:13,607 --> 01:23:19,553
i will come here again to pick you up

897
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,366
Trust me

898
01:23:28,972 --> 01:23:30,136
See you

899
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:32,191
See you

900
01:24:36,282 --> 01:24:37,735
Kamiya

901
01:24:38,431 --> 01:24:41,079
Do you have data on coal mine turnover?

902
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:45,095
I have not prepared for that yet

903
01:24:45,470 --> 01:24:46,618
Please prepare it

904
01:25:19,302 --> 01:25:20,880
Kikuta,Phone call

905
01:25:22,614 --> 01:25:23,325
Take this

906
01:25:39,408 --> 01:25:40,806
Hello? I'm Kikuta

907
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,853
Oh Kamiya

908
01:25:44,751 --> 01:25:45,533
Are you alright?

909
01:25:46,056 --> 01:25:47,626
I'm alright

910
01:25:49,317 --> 01:25:49,661
Bar?

911
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:50,723
Which?

912
01:25:52,927 --> 01:25:54,036
bar Aki?

913
01:25:56,270 --> 01:25:56,817
Madam?

914
01:25:58,130 --> 01:25:59,973
She doesn't come to work these days.

915
01:26:01,151 --> 01:26:02,839
I think she went to play somewhere

916
01:26:05,354 --> 01:26:06,808
I haven't seen her lately

917
01:26:08,987 --> 01:26:12,870
let's meet again then

918
01:26:16,758 --> 01:26:19,704
I'm busy so I can't check her

919
01:26:20,086 --> 01:26:21,039
I'm busy

920
01:26:21,868 --> 01:26:24,829
Come here if you love her

921
01:27:01,218 --> 01:27:01,687
Hello?

922
01:27:02,968 --> 01:27:04,546
Welcome

923
01:27:10,734 --> 01:27:11,398
Welcome

924
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:15,914
there is an empty seat in the back

925
01:27:15,939 --> 01:27:16,961
Here's fine

926
01:27:17,156 --> 01:27:18,523
It's been a age

927
01:27:19,131 --> 01:27:20,256
Drink this?

928
01:27:23,935 --> 01:27:24,842
Welcome

929
01:27:25,693 --> 01:27:28,591
when did you come here?

930
01:27:28,616 --> 01:27:29,756
I've just arrived

931
01:27:31,068 --> 01:27:33,139
He's Kamiya

932
01:27:33,389 --> 01:27:35,287
He is a reporter for a weekly journal in Tokyo.

933
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,459
Nice to meet you

934
01:27:38,721 --> 01:27:41,901
Did Akiko leave this bar?

935
01:27:42,745 --> 01:27:43,932
She's died

936
01:27:45,741 --> 01:27:46,194
When?

937
01:27:46,725 --> 01:27:49,085
2 months ago.
You didn't know?

938
01:27:51,959 --> 01:27:52,873
2 months ago.

939
01:27:56,810 --> 01:28:00,021
she died suddenly

940
01:28:00,046 --> 01:28:01,084
Yeah

941
01:28:01,935 --> 01:28:06,498
she put up with her illness

942
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,123
i didn't notice that

943
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:11,959
She was nice person

944
01:28:27,100 --> 01:28:29,326
Are you alright?

945
01:28:29,811 --> 01:28:30,827
I'm alright

946
01:28:38,726 --> 01:28:42,250
i was resting,sorry

947
01:29:06,305 --> 01:29:08,602
You didn't know...

948
01:29:09,500 --> 01:29:11,172
Since when has her illness been bad?

949
01:29:12,297 --> 01:29:17,289
We were in the habit of not talking to each other about our illness.

950
01:29:17,547 --> 01:29:20,071
I thought it was pointless to talk about illness

951
01:29:20,969 --> 01:29:25,282
we tried to forget it

952
01:29:25,985 --> 01:29:29,547
I can't believe she died suddenly

953
01:29:30,227 --> 01:29:31,321
In the hospital?

954
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:35,914
She collapsed in her apartment on her way to work

955
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:40,368
She pushed herself too hard

956
01:29:41,595 --> 01:29:48,181
she was dead when i went there

957
01:29:50,105 --> 01:29:55,472
We promised that when we die, we won't show it to anyone.

958
01:29:56,244 --> 01:30:01,556
A few of us attended her funeral.

959
01:30:03,226 --> 01:30:05,015
It was too lonely

960
01:30:07,775 --> 01:30:13,455
But I think it was what she wanted

961
01:30:14,402 --> 01:30:19,004
She's been here for the past three months, reading your letter.

962
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:24,176
she looked very happy

963
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,349
I should have come earlier

964
01:30:30,216 --> 01:30:35,982
she never intended to see you again

965
01:30:36,976 --> 01:30:39,077
Why?

966
01:30:39,695 --> 01:30:46,476
If she is going to meet you, I think she went to Tokyo to see you.

967
01:30:48,263 --> 01:30:55,286
The last night she spent with you in Hiroshima was her last.

968
01:30:56,870 --> 01:31:01,917
she ended her life that day

969
01:31:04,308 --> 01:31:09,316
We live as if we don't know when we will die

970
01:31:10,096 --> 01:31:19,652
I think it's really miraculous that we meet someone we've given our hearts to.

971
01:31:20,304 --> 01:31:21,836
it's so dreamy

972
01:31:23,234 --> 01:31:30,062
I'm so glad she finally had a happy day.

973
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:32,203
I think like that

974
01:35:22,258 --> 01:35:28,859
THE END

2
00:00:15,008 --> 00:00:22,765
The Sisters and I

3
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:04,594
Do the alignments!

4
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,188
Start!

5
00:01:11,727 --> 00:01:13,625
Do the alignments!

6
00:01:14,313 --> 00:01:15,742
Start!

7
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:19,594
Make the right group

8
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:21,477
Start!

9
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:35,742
Good morning

10
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,586
Anyone here?

11
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:01,313
Sen-san

12
00:03:03,649 --> 00:03:04,586
It's been a while

13
00:03:05,032 --> 00:03:06,477
I was surprised

14
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,039
I was surprised

15
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:13,758
I was really surprised

16
00:03:13,783 --> 00:03:15,891
See how my heart is pounding

17
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:17,938
My heart is pounding in my chest.

18
00:03:18,141 --> 00:03:19,133
I called you but you didn't come

19
00:03:19,539 --> 00:03:20,289
Sorry

20
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:26,750
I thought you don't like me

21
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:27,938
Why?

22
00:03:28,313 --> 00:03:30,227
You didn't contact me at all

23
00:03:31,149 --> 00:03:35,969
I saw in the newspaper that you quit writing a novel

24
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:37,477
I was worried

25
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,156
I thought you committed suicide

26
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,008
You are good at kidding

27
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:47,289
Why did you stop writing novels?

28
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:55,400
It seems that the novel I write is not good for the Japanese people

29
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,760
I like your humane novel

30
00:04:00,947 --> 00:04:04,337
Your novel comforts people

31
00:04:04,572 --> 00:04:05,799
You tell the army so

32
00:04:06,298 --> 00:04:07,330
Shall I?

33
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,619
You go to jail

34
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,478
That's bad for me

35
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,017
The dance you did was Kurokami?

36
00:04:16,892 --> 00:04:17,369
Yes

37
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:19,400
I'm glad to see your dance

38
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,002
A bush warbler was just in our yard.

39
00:04:23,486 --> 00:04:25,947
I felt like dancing a little

40
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:27,197
I'm glad

41
00:04:27,814 --> 00:04:29,096
You remind me of Kyoto

42
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:32,088
What meal do you want?

43
00:04:32,322 --> 00:04:34,635
I want to eat ochazuke.

44
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:38,915
There are only simple dishes

45
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:39,853
That's OK

46
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,142
Here's your tea

47
00:04:53,619 --> 00:04:54,627
Oshima

48
00:04:55,682 --> 00:04:57,252
I'll live here

49
00:04:57,986 --> 00:04:59,494
Make yourself at home

50
00:05:00,182 --> 00:05:01,205
Forever

51
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:03,642
You can stay here forever

52
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,158
No one live here besides you?

53
00:05:19,392 --> 00:05:23,057
Only me and my grandmother live here

54
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:28,236
Many people want to work at our inn

55
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:30,721
But I refuse everyone

56
00:05:30,869 --> 00:05:32,541
That's good for me

57
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,400
It tastes good

58
00:05:39,892 --> 00:05:41,955
I'm going to see the temple from noon

59
00:05:42,588 --> 00:05:43,635
Which temple?

60
00:05:43,892 --> 00:05:45,572
I'll go to Myo-temple

61
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:47,533
That's good

62
00:05:48,424 --> 00:05:50,752
I decided to go there from the time I left Tokyo

63
00:05:52,314 --> 00:05:58,494
A woman quit her job to become a monk in Kyoto.

64
00:06:00,455 --> 00:06:02,549
I miss her

65
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:06,978
I was also a geisha in Gion, Kyoto

66
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:09,424
I quit my  job and live in Okazaki now

67
00:06:10,392 --> 00:06:13,978
You have no sex appeal compared to her

68
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:17,642
You are so mean

69
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,119
Are you looking for Anjo?

70
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:47,994
Is she here?

71
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:52,041
She went to pick flowers

72
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,635
Oh I see

73
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:55,182
She'll be back soon

74
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,189
Thanks for coming

75
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:23,009
Did you also come to visit Anjo?

76
00:07:23,908 --> 00:07:24,557
Yes

77
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:32,510
Are you Shinkichi Yuki?

78
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:33,822
Do you know of me?

79
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,572
That's what I thought

80
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:41,807
It's rare for a young woman to come here

81
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,314
Did you see my picture in a magazine?

82
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:46,221
No

83
00:07:47,932 --> 00:07:48,791
Why do you know of me?

84
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:51,103
I have known you for a long time

85
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,158
Really?

86
00:07:52,814 --> 00:07:56,002
I am Hisako from a certain restaurant.

87
00:07:56,408 --> 00:07:58,447
Oh you are the Hisako?

88
00:07:59,017 --> 00:08:00,322
I was surprised

89
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,064
Really

90
00:08:04,908 --> 00:08:06,650
You've grown so much

91
00:08:07,924 --> 00:08:11,228
I haven't seen you for a while.
I'm glad to see you again

92
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:12,994
How's your father?

93
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,236
He died last spring

94
00:08:17,338 --> 00:08:18,197
I didn't know that

95
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:20,221
I see

96
00:08:21,674 --> 00:08:23,947
I'm sorry

97
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,244
He was still young

98
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,557
He was 60 yrs old

99
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:35,119
How is your restaurant?
Your sister was married and left

100
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,900
I stopped going to the restaurant because she left

101
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:40,869
I'm sorry

102
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,252
She's come back

103
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:47,142
In Kyoto?
Does her husband work in Kyoto?

104
00:08:48,244 --> 00:08:49,697
Or did he serve in the military?

105
00:08:50,392 --> 00:08:53,478
She was kicked out because she didn't fit in his house

106
00:08:58,392 --> 00:09:02,377
Now our restaurant is making bento boxes for munitions factories

107
00:09:02,775 --> 00:09:06,752
My sister makes a special bento for her close friends

108
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:07,557
I see

109
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:10,822
My sister will be delighted, so please come!

110
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,111
You should cut your hair

111
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:21,424
You will be attacked by the soldiers

112
00:09:21,877 --> 00:09:25,205
I don't care.
I can go anywhere

113
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,393
Your sister'll be lonely without you

114
00:09:30,346 --> 00:09:31,799
She won't

115
00:09:33,854 --> 00:09:38,775
I'll be in a shaved head sooner or later.

116
00:09:40,354 --> 00:09:44,705
You're angry that they're taking you to war.

117
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,979
Or you don't like your sister?

118
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:48,275
Which?

119
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,119
Both

120
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,127
You should get married with me

121
00:09:54,212 --> 00:09:58,291
It's hard for me to be a clerk all the time

122
00:09:59,393 --> 00:10:00,682
What do you think?

123
00:10:03,314 --> 00:10:05,033
You don't know how I feel

124
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:07,682
What did you say?

125
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:10,299
Stop it.
Did you finish your cooking?

126
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:12,346
Please deliver it to the factory when you can cook

127
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:24,994
Ah

128
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:30,322
Hisako sister is coming back

129
00:10:32,846 --> 00:10:34,471
Where are you going.Akibo

130
00:10:36,658 --> 00:10:38,611
Do you have any problems with AkiBo?

131
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,830
Nothing

132
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:41,049
Please come in

133
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,057
Oh you

134
00:10:45,463 --> 00:10:46,557
It's been a whole

135
00:10:46,597 --> 00:10:48,010
I wanted to see you

136
00:10:48,494 --> 00:10:51,189
I'm glad you've come

137
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:53,908
Please come in

138
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:55,393
Here's fine

139
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:58,166
I want you to come in

140
00:11:07,994 --> 00:11:09,572
It's been a whole

141
00:11:10,174 --> 00:11:11,439
Welcome

142
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:14,447
I heard a lot about you

143
00:11:15,533 --> 00:11:17,408
Hisako told you?

144
00:11:21,595 --> 00:11:23,486
Do you prefer Alcohol to tea?

145
00:11:24,252 --> 00:11:26,393
I hear you are cooking

146
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:28,462
I learned cooking from my father

147
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,369
Can you cook?

148
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,947
I have no choice but to cook

149
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:36,057
There are only elderly cooks here

150
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,752
Can you cook local food here

151
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,354
Yes

152
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,962
Can you?

153
00:11:45,213 --> 00:11:46,713
Can you serve it for him?

154
00:11:47,229 --> 00:11:52,494
I want you to eat our local food

155
00:12:07,424 --> 00:12:10,338
Why they kicked you out?

156
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,604
You were there for 3 yrs

157
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:18,252
I didn't go well with my mother-in-law

158
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:23,939
I put up with it very much

159
00:12:26,424 --> 00:12:29,494
She complained about my cooking

160
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:32,955
I was scolded a lot by her

161
00:12:33,658 --> 00:12:35,064
What do you think?

162
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:36,354
Really?

163
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:37,947
That's bullshit

164
00:12:38,392 --> 00:12:43,822
I was complained to her that I drank too much and had too much sex appeal

165
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,768
She's so mean

166
00:12:46,525 --> 00:12:49,643
But I put up with it for 3 years

167
00:12:50,955 --> 00:12:52,314
Please praise me

168
00:12:52,932 --> 00:12:56,033
You are not great.
You should have come back sooner.

169
00:12:57,588 --> 00:13:01,432
Let us stop telling this story

170
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:59,666
Please enjoy our Miso dish

171
00:14:00,017 --> 00:14:00,962
I will eat

172
00:14:09,385 --> 00:14:10,150
It tastes good

173
00:14:10,814 --> 00:14:11,588
Really?

174
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,189
I'm glad

175
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:19,486
It tastes good.
I'm surprised

176
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:23,307
It tastes the same as the food your dad cooked.
How did you learn it?

177
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:29,602
I'm very happy to be complimented by someone like you

178
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,525
I'll serve you a sake

179
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,596
My dad was disappointed that they kicked me out

180
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:58,963
My dad trained me hard for two years

181
00:15:00,416 --> 00:15:02,182
It was too hard

182
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:04,807
You're great

183
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:12,354
It ’s amazing that you girls have a dead father and two women running this restaurant.

184
00:15:14,119 --> 00:15:17,635
I travel with a ban against writing novels.

185
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,119
I was encouraged by you

186
00:15:22,932 --> 00:15:25,369
I will do my best like you

187
00:15:25,986 --> 00:15:28,299
Shake hands with me

188
00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:31,494
I’m horned

189
00:15:35,682 --> 00:15:36,408
Hello?

190
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,643
Eh? To where?

191
00:15:41,611 --> 00:15:42,854
I need to ask my sister

192
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:45,799
From Who?

193
00:15:47,494 --> 00:15:50,853
Akio is at the Kyoto Hotel so He wants me to come

194
00:15:51,322 --> 00:15:52,299
Please go

195
00:15:52,963 --> 00:15:54,525
You can talk with him

196
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,104
Please go

197
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:00,471
I'm going out

198
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:01,182
Take care

199
00:16:06,627 --> 00:16:08,361
Akio is having a fight with his fiancé

200
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:17,275
Don't do anything to me

201
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:23,666
What do you think about me?

202
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,104
I am your fiancée

203
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,111
What do you mean by that?

204
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:30,111
Do you know the meaning of fiancée?

205
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:33,307
The meaning is that marriage is allowed

206
00:16:33,729 --> 00:16:35,729
It means we can get married

207
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:36,713
That's right

208
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:38,760
So we can sleep together

209
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:43,752
We can have sex after the wedding

210
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:46,635
Have a seat

211
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:53,729
You don't like me?

212
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,822
It does not matter

213
00:16:56,338 --> 00:16:59,018
I'm asking you like me or not

214
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:00,299
I like you

215
00:17:01,432 --> 00:17:02,385
You are lair

216
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,518
You just pretended to like me

217
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:08,666
Don't pretend you are elegant

218
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,408
I am elegant

219
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:11,986
You are not

220
00:17:21,705 --> 00:17:22,330
Drink it

221
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,189
I'll give you

222
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:33,424
Stop it

223
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:34,971
Stop it

224
00:17:35,393 --> 00:17:36,111
Stop it

225
00:17:36,314 --> 00:17:36,908
Stop it

226
00:18:09,018 --> 00:18:09,994
What happened?

227
00:18:12,064 --> 00:18:13,330
What happened?

228
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,916
Tell me

229
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,103
He forced me

230
00:18:23,408 --> 00:18:24,291
That's no problem

231
00:18:25,768 --> 00:18:26,502
Sister

232
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:30,744
Did you sleep with him?

233
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,752
Don't make fun of me

234
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:52,166
Did you have fun there?

235
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,791
We are old but They are young

236
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:58,611
That's right

237
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,471
You are so mean

238
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,619
Where are you going?

239
00:19:15,939 --> 00:19:21,635
1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.1.2.

240
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:25,611


241
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,674
I refreshed

242
00:19:43,603 --> 00:19:44,564
Are you going to sleep?

243
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,353
I'll write something

244
00:19:47,588 --> 00:19:50,369
Please set my bed

245
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:51,322
Sure

246
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:11,502
I feel sorry for Kiyo

247
00:20:13,275 --> 00:20:16,221
Her mother died when she was young.
And she worked so hard

248
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,502
She got married but she was kicked out

249
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:23,088
She loved someone before she got married

250
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,549
It might be so

251
00:20:27,205 --> 00:20:30,119
But her dad was very strict

252
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:33,518
Does she have anyone to consult?

253
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:39,790
Unfortunately she has that person

254
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:41,502
She has?

255
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,494
Don't be disappointed

256
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:49,853
That person is a very serious person in the neighborhood

257
00:20:52,564 --> 00:20:56,471
Can I go talk to Mr. Tamura?

258
00:21:00,603 --> 00:21:04,018
Anyway, my father's first anniversary is over

259
00:21:04,603 --> 00:21:07,127
You had better get married early

260
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,635
It's none of your business

261
00:21:12,611 --> 00:21:17,361
I can't sleep unless I decide clearly

262
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,213
It's not about your marriage

263
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,689
You should go to bed

264
00:21:24,674 --> 00:21:26,799
Ok you can go

265
00:21:27,275 --> 00:21:29,783
Thank you for your permission

266
00:21:30,768 --> 00:21:32,580
I can sleep with peace of mind

267
00:21:33,307 --> 00:21:34,853
You should go upstairs now

268
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:38,994
You are so pervert

269
00:22:11,611 --> 00:22:12,408
I get it

270
00:22:12,939 --> 00:22:15,877
Let's get ready for the wedding now

271
00:22:16,447 --> 00:22:17,713
Before he changes his mind

272
00:22:18,627 --> 00:22:19,455
Thank you

273
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:25,361
Thank you for listening to me

274
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,572
I'm sure Toto City's older brother will be happy.

275
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,244
Kiyo

276
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,439
Hello?
I'm here to see you

277
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:54,596
For what?

278
00:22:55,947 --> 00:22:58,103
I'm here to talk about your marriage

279
00:22:59,197 --> 00:23:02,393
Dad told you guys to have a wedding early

280
00:23:03,806 --> 00:23:06,197
I won't get married

281
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:08,908
Akibo

282
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:13,712
Let's go to Kiyomizu together

283
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:44,393
Why did you say you wouldn't get married suddenly?

284
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:50,275
I don't like Hisako

285
00:23:51,314 --> 00:23:52,893
What did you say?

286
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:57,486
I hate her attitude

287
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:01,478
You loved her,right?

288
00:24:02,822 --> 00:24:04,877
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

289
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,682
I'll tell you the truth

290
00:24:19,768 --> 00:24:20,846
Tell me

291
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:25,346
To be honest, I loved you

292
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:30,510
Don't say bullshit

293
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:32,041
Really

294
00:24:32,978 --> 00:24:36,799
I agreed to marry her so that I could be near you.

295
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:42,158
Don't tell her that

296
00:24:43,939 --> 00:24:46,658
She will be sad when she hears it

297
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:47,722
I don't care

298
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,986
I love you

299
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:51,205
Really

300
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,540
Stop it,Akibo

301
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:55,478
Let me go

302
00:24:55,503 --> 00:24:56,760
Really

303
00:24:57,814 --> 00:24:59,822
I wanted someone like you

304
00:25:00,494 --> 00:25:02,252
Stop it,Akibo

305
00:25:02,721 --> 00:25:03,838
Let me go

306
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:06,338
No

307
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:08,994
I won't let you go

308
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:12,314
Stop it,Akibo
That's not good

309
00:25:26,338 --> 00:25:28,822
I'll be waiting at Shinoda of Otsubu tonight

310
00:25:47,783 --> 00:25:51,276
How have you been doing?

311
00:26:03,924 --> 00:26:06,018
Are you still awake?

312
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,010
Who's visited me at such a late night?

313
00:26:09,783 --> 00:26:11,744
Kiyo from Totoki

314
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:16,924
Oh you

315
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,729
Sorry to make you wake up

316
00:26:20,315 --> 00:26:21,440
What's wrong?

317
00:26:22,377 --> 00:26:23,768
She's got drunk

318
00:26:24,017 --> 00:26:25,736
She's loopy

319
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,432
What are you talking about?

320
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:35,846
I'm a woman with a drinking problem.

321
00:26:36,213 --> 00:26:37,963
I wonder if there was anything happy for her.

322
00:26:40,815 --> 00:26:42,236
Yes there is

323
00:26:42,721 --> 00:26:45,416
My sister's wedding is set.

324
00:26:46,322 --> 00:26:47,338
That's good news

325
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,901
Congratulation

326
00:26:51,307 --> 00:26:52,666
I'm so glad

327
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,877
I want to drink more

328
00:26:59,127 --> 00:27:00,276
I want to drink

329
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:01,635
You shouldn’t drink much

330
00:27:03,096 --> 00:27:06,736
Why you stop me to drink?

331
00:27:07,893 --> 00:27:11,822
You're not going to celebrate a happy story?

332
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,096
OK let's toast together

333
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,463
I want cold sake

334
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,080
OK let's toast together

335
00:27:37,885 --> 00:27:38,619
Congratulation

336
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:39,955
Thank you

337
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:40,986
Congratulation

338
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:56,885
That would be fine

339
00:27:59,526 --> 00:28:02,393
Let's sing together

340
00:28:02,901 --> 00:28:05,049
It's too late to sing

341
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,994
Well done

342
00:30:04,979 --> 00:30:06,752
You were drunk, but you sang well.

343
00:30:08,621 --> 00:30:10,097
I can't hold back

344
00:30:11,363 --> 00:30:14,363
You've got a big mouth.

345
00:30:15,332 --> 00:30:18,324
You should go to bed,Kiyo

346
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:21,269
Oh my god

347
00:30:22,441 --> 00:30:26,730
It can't be helped.
You may catch a cold

348
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,207
It seems she was so happy

349
00:30:58,605 --> 00:31:00,738
She is very much a sister.

350
00:31:02,121 --> 00:31:04,074
She thinks she is her mother.

351
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,871
Leave her alone.
I go to bed

352
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,777
Sorry to make you trouble

353
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:51,761
Sensei

354
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:54,363
Don't come here

355
00:31:54,683 --> 00:31:56,871
Never mind

356
00:31:58,051 --> 00:31:59,215
Hug me please

357
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,308
I want to be your woman

358
00:32:05,168 --> 00:32:06,168
Sensei

359
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:08,769
I'm embarrassed

360
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,230
I can't.
Get up

361
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:21,551
You take better care of yourself.
You just got out of an unhappy marriage.

362
00:32:24,004 --> 00:32:27,418
You have to find real love from now on

363
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:34,613
I really love you

364
00:32:36,074 --> 00:32:37,574
You can see me when you are not drunk

365
00:32:39,972 --> 00:32:42,113
Don't say that when you're drunk.

366
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:44,769
I don't like such a woman

367
00:32:55,051 --> 00:32:56,285
I was sorry

368
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:04,004
I'll be back.
Good night

369
00:33:26,699 --> 00:33:28,231
I called you

370
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,348
Oume said you were not here

371
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:32,613
I've been waiting for you here

372
00:33:33,668 --> 00:33:34,754
Where have you been?

373
00:33:38,082 --> 00:33:39,496
Let's go

374
00:33:39,582 --> 00:33:40,863
Where are we going?

375
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:43,793
I know a good scotch bar.

376
00:33:44,512 --> 00:33:45,254
Really?

377
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,551
You know what?
Okiyo

378
00:33:59,988 --> 00:34:01,606
Please love me

379
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:06,192
I can't live without you

380
00:34:07,324 --> 00:34:09,153
Please love me

381
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,238
I can't,Akio

382
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,348
Where did you stay last night?

383
00:35:26,418 --> 00:35:27,684
At my mom's place

384
00:35:28,871 --> 00:35:30,559
I fell asleep in the living room

385
00:35:30,707 --> 00:35:34,403
Seisei called us and worried about you

386
00:35:36,731 --> 00:35:39,348
Why you make a lie?
Where did you stay last night?

387
00:35:40,262 --> 00:35:44,168
I was sleeping on the current bench in the museum

388
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:47,231
That's bad

389
00:35:51,207 --> 00:35:56,403
I was so embarrassed that I lied

390
00:35:57,434 --> 00:36:00,535
What if you get sick?

391
00:36:01,012 --> 00:36:03,863
Don't do that again

392
00:36:12,449 --> 00:36:14,332
What did you come to do so quickly?

393
00:36:23,957 --> 00:36:24,645
Hisako

394
00:36:25,746 --> 00:36:27,028
Let's break our engagement

395
00:36:27,512 --> 00:36:28,270
Akibo

396
00:36:28,746 --> 00:36:32,410
We do not allow it

397
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:34,262
Why did you go home first?

398
00:36:43,387 --> 00:36:46,035
I've been loved your sister

399
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:50,449
We had slept together

400
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,973
Where are you going?

401
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:12,449
It's none of your business!

402
00:37:14,684 --> 00:37:15,660
Don't go

403
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:17,684
Don't go

404
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,426
Boss is here?

405
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,262
Yes

406
00:37:30,254 --> 00:37:31,285
Boss

407
00:37:32,074 --> 00:37:32,707
What's wrong?

408
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:34,778
Please come to our restaurant?

409
00:37:35,121 --> 00:37:35,918
What's wrong?

410
00:37:36,129 --> 00:37:37,567
There was a big problem

411
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,051
Damn it!

412
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:43,809
Are you thinking of your dead father?

413
00:37:43,856 --> 00:37:44,731
Slap me

414
00:37:44,918 --> 00:37:45,817
What?

415
00:37:45,842 --> 00:37:47,301
Slap me

416
00:38:04,856 --> 00:38:06,488
What if Hisako won't go home?

417
00:38:07,238 --> 00:38:08,004
You stupid

418
00:38:09,668 --> 00:38:13,301
I didn't want to make a marriage failure like my sister

419
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:18,567
I tried to be a good female cook

420
00:38:19,293 --> 00:38:23,449
Akio doesn't like such women

421
00:38:24,629 --> 00:38:25,434
He told me so

422
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,090
He told you so?

423
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:29,567
He doesn't like me

424
00:38:30,379 --> 00:38:33,153
That's bad.
You should separate with him

425
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:38,332
He's bad.
It's ok if you break your marriage proposal

426
00:38:40,817 --> 00:38:41,434
Wait

427
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:45,145
Hisako doesn't not say she does not want to marry with Akio

428
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,535
But, Sensei

429
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,074
When kiyoko goes to Hozansan?

430
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:51,106
Yesterday

431
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,629
Then She came to us that day

432
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:02,098
Why did she do that

433
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:05,043
You know what,sensei

434
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:08,840
Let's have KIYO come here with Totoichi's older brother

435
00:39:09,184 --> 00:39:11,723
Let's talk with us

436
00:39:11,748 --> 00:39:12,785
Well

437
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:15,715
What do you think?

438
00:39:16,309 --> 00:39:17,973
That's good for you

439
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,582
Let's do it

440
00:39:32,048 --> 00:39:34,610
Eh? she's there?

441
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:39,220
Hisako is at Okazaki

442
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,696
Hello?
I'm Totoichi

443
00:39:46,352 --> 00:39:47,173
Thank you

444
00:39:51,017 --> 00:39:53,517
Sorry to make you trouble

445
00:40:03,642 --> 00:40:04,759
She'll come

446
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:08,399
Kiyo hate it

447
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:11,720
Totoichi's older brother will take her

448
00:40:26,954 --> 00:40:30,727
I am...

449
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:35,454
going out

450
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:37,165
Why?

451
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:39,618
We need you

452
00:40:39,643 --> 00:40:40,798
Leave it to you

453
00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:53,071
This may be the writer's intuition

454
00:40:54,188 --> 00:40:57,782
Something happened to her when she went to talk about her wedding

455
00:40:58,540 --> 00:40:59,157
I think so

456
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,618
She asked me to forget it

457
00:41:07,126 --> 00:41:08,212
I didn't know that

458
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:11,735
I got angry with her

459
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:17,227
You also pretended to be a good man

460
00:41:17,813 --> 00:41:18,899
Because

461
00:41:19,876 --> 00:41:24,688
If you had sex with her this wouldn't happen

462
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:27,095
I'm in trouble

463
00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:29,415
I also feel responsible

464
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:30,977
So please

465
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:38,196
I want to sleep with you if I'm in trouble too

466
00:41:39,032 --> 00:41:41,017
I'm honor to sleep with you

467
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:43,634
You are mean

468
00:41:47,454 --> 00:41:48,509
Bad man

469
00:42:17,977 --> 00:42:18,860
Kiyo

470
00:42:20,017 --> 00:42:21,165
Where's Totoichi's older brother?

471
00:42:23,243 --> 00:42:27,540
He told me to go alone.

472
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,407
What happened to you?

473
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:42,165
I went to talk about my sister's wedding

474
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:46,767
He told me He hates her

475
00:42:47,282 --> 00:42:49,431
He told me he loves me

476
00:42:50,282 --> 00:42:52,024
I was upset

477
00:42:52,743 --> 00:42:58,571
You've had a hard life and you shouldn't be so easily offended.

478
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:00,618
But mom

479
00:43:01,767 --> 00:43:06,743
I thought he was like my brother.

480
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:10,907
I was very surprised

481
00:43:11,688 --> 00:43:13,056
I know how you feel

482
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:18,517
I've never loved someone before

483
00:43:20,532 --> 00:43:24,829
I had an unhappy marriage and was only sad

484
00:43:25,665 --> 00:43:27,767
I was in trouble when he said that

485
00:43:28,306 --> 00:43:29,579
But

486
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:31,860
Wait for me

487
00:43:33,149 --> 00:43:40,087
I was in trouble and came here

488
00:43:40,681 --> 00:43:41,431
You know what

489
00:43:43,915 --> 00:43:47,477
Why did sensei not have sex with Kiyo

490
00:43:49,134 --> 00:43:51,337
He can be pretentious at times.

491
00:43:52,102 --> 00:43:54,048
He is a very troublesome person

492
00:43:55,884 --> 00:43:57,352
I was scold by him

493
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:04,743
Actually I love him

494
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:08,837
I don't know why he is so popular with women

495
00:44:11,009 --> 00:44:16,446
I came home dumped and scolded by him.

496
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:19,196
Then Akibo was waiting in front of house

497
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:23,595
I was asked to go bar with him

498
00:44:24,798 --> 00:44:26,212
It can't be helped

499
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:32,313
I was stupid

500
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,571
I always thought of him as my brother.

501
00:44:39,852 --> 00:44:42,454
I did something very stupid

502
00:44:43,595 --> 00:44:47,095
You are so stupid

503
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:49,587
Yes I am

504
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,501
I did something very stupid

505
00:44:56,517 --> 00:45:00,181
You really think so?

506
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:01,665
Yes

507
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:08,493
She came here alone

508
00:45:18,579 --> 00:45:20,071
Have a seat

509
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:25,298
Come in

510
00:45:31,759 --> 00:45:34,485
Do you girls fight?

511
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:37,204
I can be a referee

512
00:45:46,931 --> 00:45:48,696
Can you bring the dish

513
00:45:48,954 --> 00:45:49,610
Sure

514
00:45:50,446 --> 00:45:55,345
I made oden for you

515
00:45:56,517 --> 00:45:58,306
Come here now

516
00:46:05,353 --> 00:46:06,384
Thank you

517
00:46:28,712 --> 00:46:30,134
Have a drink

518
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:36,119
Hisako too

519
00:46:36,861 --> 00:46:39,907
I can't drink to make up

520
00:46:40,205 --> 00:46:41,955
I don't mean that

521
00:46:53,056 --> 00:46:53,658
Let's drink

522
00:46:58,455 --> 00:46:59,845
Drink it

523
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:05,353
Eat some Oden

524
00:47:17,150 --> 00:47:17,908
How's it?

525
00:47:19,853 --> 00:47:21,259
It tastes good

526
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:36,001
You just gave in to temptation,right?

527
00:47:38,955 --> 00:47:42,314
Your sister is very remorseful.

528
00:47:44,392 --> 00:47:48,228
She didn't mean to break your relationship

529
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:55,056
She already had male experience

530
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:59,603
Young men like people like her

531
00:48:00,478 --> 00:48:06,095
Your sister was trying to comfort the young man

532
00:48:06,774 --> 00:48:07,938
Please understand her

533
00:48:08,611 --> 00:48:09,611
I don't understand

534
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:13,119
It can't be helped

535
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,244
I know you get angry

536
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:22,727
I know you can't forgive her

537
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:27,072
But you are sisters

538
00:48:28,564 --> 00:48:30,790
Please forgive her

539
00:48:32,455 --> 00:48:33,150
No

540
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:35,619
I'm sorry too

541
00:48:36,111 --> 00:48:38,658
You have nothing to do with her

542
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:46,829
Say sorry to her

543
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:49,408
I'll say sorry too

544
00:48:52,572 --> 00:48:55,001
I'm sorry,Hisako

545
00:49:01,994 --> 00:49:03,017

547
00:49:10,369 --> 00:49:11,322
I was sorry

548
00:49:12,603 --> 00:49:14,423
Forgive me

549
00:49:15,103 --> 00:49:16,736
Forgive me

550
00:49:18,806 --> 00:49:19,533
Hisako

551
00:49:21,837 --> 00:49:22,900

Forgive her

553
00:49:25,673 --> 00:49:27,619
You can go home with her

554
00:49:28,681 --> 00:49:29,509
Hisako

555
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:40,775
Someone is outside

556
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:47,626
A man?

557
00:49:48,447 --> 00:49:50,744
I have no idea

558
00:49:51,236 --> 00:49:53,236
He is hiding

559
00:50:11,322 --> 00:50:12,501
Oume

560
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,337
Good evening

561
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:16,306
Come in

562
00:50:16,837 --> 00:50:17,806
Don't worry

563
00:50:19,056 --> 00:50:21,681
Did they make up?

564
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:28,697
Please let these girls go home.

565
00:50:37,275 --> 00:50:38,267
Oume came

566
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:44,548
She hopes you girls go home

567
00:50:53,181 --> 00:50:55,103
Let's go home

568
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:04,681
You should go to bed

569
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:05,751
Yes

570
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:08,111
I'll take a bath

571
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:24,197
Did you forgive me?

572
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,228
Please say something

573
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,626
Your apologies will not undo it.

574
00:51:33,064 --> 00:51:36,751
You're good but I'm not

575
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,283
Do you want me to give up?

576
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:49,973
Do you tell me to leave this house because I can't cook?

577
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:54,130
You think too much

578
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:58,965
You planned for it.

579
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,661
You stole my fiancée

580
00:52:04,036 --> 00:52:05,544
You took my guy

581
00:52:07,036 --> 00:52:09,005
You broke us

582
00:52:10,645 --> 00:52:13,012
You are so mean

583
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:34,247
Are you Akibo?

584
00:52:35,497 --> 00:52:36,715
Let's go to Tokyo

585
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,739
They are stupid

586
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:19,934
Hisako, You go to Tokusima's uncle place

587
00:53:21,106 --> 00:53:26,192
We can't work without her.

588
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:30,372
How about me?

589
00:53:31,426 --> 00:53:32,481
You go home

590
00:53:33,106 --> 00:53:34,090
No

591
00:53:34,309 --> 00:53:38,239
I'd like to take you in, but

592
00:53:38,676 --> 00:53:41,333
You are useless.
You go home and do farm job

593
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:42,426
No

594
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:44,762
What can I do?

595
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:49,598
I want to be your finance

596
00:53:49,918 --> 00:53:50,989
What?

597
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:53,543
What did you say?

598
00:53:54,215 --> 00:53:59,293
If I become your finance,
I'll take care of this restaurant

599
00:54:00,465 --> 00:54:03,840
I don't want to leave here

600
00:54:08,644 --> 00:54:11,175
OK show me your butt

601
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,122
OK.
I'll take care of you too

602
00:54:35,262 --> 00:54:36,043
Sensei

603
00:54:36,247 --> 00:54:36,989
What

604
00:54:38,247 --> 00:54:40,497
I want to tell you something

605
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:41,739
What

606
00:54:43,512 --> 00:54:46,676
Kiyo eloped with AKibo

607
00:55:07,114 --> 00:55:08,770
I made a haiku.

608
00:55:11,325 --> 00:55:16,153
Butterflies longing for spring

609
00:55:19,754 --> 00:55:22,411
Will the war really last 100 years?

610
00:55:22,436 --> 00:55:24,637
I don't think so

611
00:55:25,903 --> 00:55:31,184
The war will be over in 10 years and the world will
change.

612
00:56:01,973 --> 00:56:03,122
Welcome

613
00:56:03,528 --> 00:56:05,293
Yuki sensei has come

614
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:07,895
You are very welcome

615
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,325
Thanks for your work

616
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:18,223
Osima-san
You have his followers

617
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:21,543
I'm Yuki's wife

618
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:24,340
I didn't know that

619
00:56:25,364 --> 00:56:27,223
I'm Yuki's wife too

620
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,536
Oh you too

621
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:31,356
I'm sorry I didn't know

622
00:56:36,637 --> 00:56:38,833
It's been a long time

623
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:45,645
How're you?

624
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:50,114
Let the jokes be over.

625
00:56:50,497 --> 00:56:55,247
I am glad he got the literary award

626
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:56,833
I know how you feel

627
00:56:57,684 --> 00:57:01,489
You cared for him in Kyoto during the war.

628
00:57:01,958 --> 00:57:04,918
I hear there is a party in Tokyo, so I've come

629
00:57:06,981 --> 00:57:11,622
I am so happy to get his bouquet

630
00:57:12,879 --> 00:57:16,106
I want to take care his bouquet

631
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,637
Please be relax

632
00:57:23,559 --> 00:57:24,684
Give us Brandy

633
00:57:29,106 --> 00:57:30,856
Excuse me

634
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,497
Sensei

635
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:38,614
I'll introduce you our new worker

636
00:57:43,872 --> 00:57:45,762
I'm sorry don't introduce me

637
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,911
I can't meet him

638
00:57:49,497 --> 00:57:50,598
Why?

639
00:57:51,122 --> 00:57:52,184
Come with me

640
00:57:55,583 --> 00:57:56,598
Sensei

641
00:57:58,442 --> 00:57:59,512
Kiyoko!

642
00:58:00,723 --> 00:58:01,856
Long time no see

643
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:08,012
Oshima!

644
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:08,895
What?

645
00:58:12,098 --> 00:58:13,208
Kiyoko works here

646
00:58:15,161 --> 00:58:17,114
OKiyo

647
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:19,340
Long time no see

648
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:22,176
Do you know her?

649
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,637
We are very close

650
00:58:26,278 --> 00:58:27,942
Are there any other seats available?

651
00:58:29,098 --> 00:58:32,379
Can I talk with her?

652
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:34,856
Go ahead

653
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,801
When I come to Tokyo

654
00:58:43,122 --> 00:58:48,293
I was dumped by him

655
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:55,473
He didn't like me from the beginning

656
00:58:56,801 --> 00:59:00,754
He didn't want to marry with Hisako, so He used me

657
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:04,715
I was stupid

658
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:07,723
He is so bad

659
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:13,668
Then I worked at my friend's inn

660
00:59:15,489 --> 00:59:18,489
Then there was an air raid.

661
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,028
I lost my home

662
00:59:22,356 --> 00:59:24,512
I worked several jobs

663
00:59:25,051 --> 00:59:26,887
Why you don't go back?

664
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,622
It's hard

665
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:29,950
Really

666
00:59:30,989 --> 00:59:36,520
I was afraid to see you

667
00:59:37,551 --> 00:59:39,051
How's Akibo?

668
00:59:40,637 --> 00:59:45,004
He got a woman and have 2 kids

669
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:52,184
He's working hard and doing a great job with his ceramics.

670
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:59,879
Hisako has backed to Tokushima

671
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:04,426
I hear something about her

672
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:10,387
She opened a restaurant in Yasui

673
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:14,020
She use Name of Totoki?

674
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:20,606
No.
Totoichi brother is managing the name of Totoki

675
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:25,567
He is waiting for you to return

676
01:00:27,371 --> 01:00:29,332
You should go back in Kyoto

677
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:34,598
Let's go back in Kyoto together

678
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:41,082
But Hisako won't forgive me

679
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,137
We'll talk to her

680
01:00:44,856 --> 01:00:48,215
I'll do my best

681
01:00:49,371 --> 01:00:50,887
So let's go back

682
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:55,621
You work at TOTOKi restaurant again

683
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,364
I'll support you

684
01:01:01,418 --> 01:01:02,371
Thank you

685
01:01:27,161 --> 01:01:30,473
It's embarrassing to enter this room

686
01:01:31,153 --> 01:01:33,598
I feel very guilty

687
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:35,246
Don't say that

688
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,840
Please have a bath

689
01:01:40,481 --> 01:01:42,582
I'm ok.
What should we do?

690
01:01:44,473 --> 01:01:46,645
Let's talk about her

691
01:01:53,574 --> 01:01:56,535
I'm thinking of seeing Hisako tomorrow

692
01:01:56,614 --> 01:01:57,371
Really?

693
01:01:58,473 --> 01:02:02,004
I didn't think it was a good idea to go with her out of the blue.

694
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:05,832
I'll meet totoichi's brother and

695
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:09,442
talk about her

696
01:02:10,059 --> 01:02:12,293
Then I'll go to see Hisako

697
01:02:12,504 --> 01:02:13,684
Can you do that?

698
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:15,786
I'll go

699
01:02:16,153 --> 01:02:17,762
It's not good if you go

700
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:18,676
Why?

701
01:02:19,004 --> 01:02:23,114
I think if Sensei goes,totoichi's brother is willing to listen

702
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:25,067
And Hisako is happy to come

703
01:02:25,371 --> 01:02:28,504
It's troublesome if she comes

704
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,911
totoichi's brother is ok

705
01:02:33,075 --> 01:02:38,418
Hisako is not good if she only listens to Sensei

706
01:02:39,043 --> 01:02:40,996
If you go back, they won't feel better.

707
01:02:43,098 --> 01:02:48,520
I will talk first and Sensei will take you home

708
01:02:48,809 --> 01:02:50,700
You look very confident

709
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:52,700
Leave it to me

710
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:10,590
It's up to Hisako to give the shop sign

711
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,340
Hisako forgive her first

712
01:03:15,364 --> 01:03:20,098
I want to make sure their sisters get along well

713
01:03:22,864 --> 01:03:25,231
How does Hisako feel now?

714
01:03:26,051 --> 01:03:26,653
She?

715
01:03:28,223 --> 01:03:32,161
She is very worried about her sister

716
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,332
But I don't know if she forgives her or not

717
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:45,231
Can you talk to Hisako?

718
01:03:45,723 --> 01:03:46,957
Please

719
01:03:49,254 --> 01:03:52,926
I'm sorry I can't

720
01:03:55,356 --> 01:04:02,864
I can't tell what kind of condition Kiyoko is in from what you have told me.

721
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:06,418
I have no reason to ask her

722
01:04:07,473 --> 01:04:09,004
Kiyoko apologize first

723
01:04:09,684 --> 01:04:14,551
Then Hisako forgives her.
This is better

724
01:04:17,223 --> 01:04:18,442
I get it

725
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:22,645
I'll go to see her

726
01:04:23,723 --> 01:04:24,887
Whereabouts Yasui?

727
01:04:25,348 --> 01:04:26,606
Nishiura in Yasui

728
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:29,434
I'll ask if she is there or not

729
01:04:40,809 --> 01:04:43,168
Hello?
It's me

730
01:04:44,176 --> 01:04:47,036
Well, Kiyoko has back in Kyoto

731
01:04:47,426 --> 01:04:48,754
Wait wait

732
01:04:49,442 --> 01:04:52,825
Mom will visit you to talk about it

733
01:04:54,184 --> 01:04:57,176
You should talk with her seriously

734
01:04:58,403 --> 01:04:59,051
Talk to you later

735
01:05:03,809 --> 01:05:08,942
So please take care of her.

736
01:05:18,621 --> 01:05:21,661
Get better, Hisako

737
01:05:23,036 --> 01:05:25,004
She made you suffer.

738
01:05:25,301 --> 01:05:26,762
She bankrupted the restaurant

739
01:05:27,418 --> 01:05:33,520
I can't forgive her when she comes back

740
01:05:52,106 --> 01:05:54,832
That's what she deserves.

741
01:05:55,754 --> 01:05:57,848
I feel sorry for her

742
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:03,379
She's stupid.
She wouldn't have a hard time if she didn't come to Kyoto

743
01:06:03,676 --> 01:06:07,457
That's right.
I didn't have to be fiancé

744
01:06:08,707 --> 01:06:10,121
Are you his fiancé?

745
01:06:10,528 --> 01:06:15,215
Because I wanted to have a relationship with the Totoki restaurant

746
01:06:15,653 --> 01:06:18,996
Totoichi's brother is taking care of me

747
01:06:26,090 --> 01:06:28,590
Of course I think it's her responsibility

748
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:32,378
You are suffering but she is suffering too

749
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,067
She is very regretful

750
01:06:39,090 --> 01:06:40,661
Do you still hate her?

751
01:06:41,504 --> 01:06:45,301
I don't hate her.
We are sisters

752
01:06:45,598 --> 01:06:46,450
That's right

753
01:06:46,661 --> 01:06:47,778
Hisako

754
01:06:49,301 --> 01:06:50,645
Be strong

755
01:06:51,832 --> 01:06:54,856
Don't interrupt us

756
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,668
What the hell who you are?

757
01:06:58,693 --> 01:06:59,871
Stop it

758
01:07:00,176 --> 01:07:01,661
Let me talk with her

759
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:06,059
She has had a lot of trouble

760
01:07:09,176 --> 01:07:11,786
I'm sorry

761
01:07:13,434 --> 01:07:17,301
Please understand how I feel

762
01:07:18,676 --> 01:07:20,739
I also want Kiyoko to come back

763
01:07:23,161 --> 01:07:27,317
I also want her to work in Totoki restaurant

764
01:07:28,356 --> 01:07:31,692
But I'm thinking of Hisako

765
01:07:36,442 --> 01:07:38,793
I'm sorry

766
01:07:41,082 --> 01:07:43,684
I also want to cry with you

767
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:46,293
I feel the same as her

768
01:07:47,379 --> 01:07:50,051
I also understand your kindness

769
01:07:51,832 --> 01:07:55,199
I can't understand why she used you

770
01:07:56,598 --> 01:07:57,863
That's my problem

771
01:07:58,739 --> 01:08:01,184
Why didn't she come alone?

772
01:08:01,426 --> 01:08:04,426
Why didn't she write to me?

773
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:07,645
Why didn't she talk to TOTOICHI brother

774
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:11,364
We are sisters

775
01:08:12,215 --> 01:08:13,512
That's right

776
01:08:15,293 --> 01:08:19,481
But She thinks you don't forgive

777
01:08:21,879 --> 01:08:23,575
I want her to come back

778
01:08:24,809 --> 01:08:25,856
Really

779
01:08:28,582 --> 01:08:30,129
I can't say

780
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:34,129
I can't say that from myself

781
01:08:35,231 --> 01:08:38,278
Please understand her feelings

782
01:08:41,543 --> 01:08:42,895
I get it

783
01:08:44,082 --> 01:08:45,418
I get it

784
01:08:48,059 --> 01:08:49,403
So what should we do?

785
01:08:53,606 --> 01:08:56,989
Can you go to see her?

786
01:08:57,598 --> 01:08:58,551
I can't

787
01:08:59,387 --> 01:09:02,153
I hope she comes back alone

788
01:09:02,707 --> 01:09:08,645
Just come back and apologize to her

789
01:09:10,496 --> 01:09:11,762
But

790
01:09:12,729 --> 01:09:15,166
I don't think she will come back alone

791
01:09:16,064 --> 01:09:17,157
Tell her to come back alone

792
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:28,611
What do you think?

793
01:09:31,572 --> 01:09:32,557
Can you go home?

794
01:09:34,846 --> 01:09:35,650
Yes

795
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:36,893
You sure?

796
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:37,775
Yes

797
01:09:40,393 --> 01:09:42,596
Apologize to her

798
01:09:43,705 --> 01:09:45,799
Please apologize to Oume too

799
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:46,846
Yes

800
01:09:49,447 --> 01:09:50,643
Excuse me

801
01:09:52,565 --> 01:09:54,049
Can you send us a cab?

802
01:10:02,276 --> 01:10:03,447
You sure to go home?

803
01:10:04,041 --> 01:10:06,151
Call me if you get home safe

804
01:10:06,721 --> 01:10:08,283
I don't care if it's late

805
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:17,838
Turn the corner

806
01:10:22,221 --> 01:10:24,330
Here's fine

807
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:29,752
She has not called me yet

808
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,971
After Kiyo got forgiveness from Hisako

809
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:40,002
Next is Totoichi's brother

810
01:10:41,127 --> 01:10:42,987
Sisters should go to apologize to him

811
01:10:44,049 --> 01:10:47,127
I'm worried if Kiyo can cook like she used to

812
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:50,455
If she can't cook, they won't use that name again

813
01:10:51,252 --> 01:11:02,166
If she makes up for it, it won't matter if she can't use the TOTOICHI name again

814
01:11:02,191 --> 01:11:03,612
That's right

815
01:11:04,354 --> 01:11:07,284
So I have an idea

816
01:11:08,729 --> 01:11:12,666
The day after tomorrow will have your celebration

817
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:16,119
Then bring the guests home.

818
01:11:17,432 --> 01:11:18,237
No problem

819
01:11:20,659 --> 01:11:23,330
Please have TOTOICHI's brother among the guests

820
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,690
Then?

821
01:11:25,479 --> 01:11:29,737
Ask Kiyo to cook

822
01:11:29,987 --> 01:11:31,448
I see

823
01:11:33,557 --> 01:11:37,705
It depends on KIYO's cooking that you can use the name of TOTOKI.

824
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:40,557
I'm going to bet on it

825
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:42,979
That's a good idea

826
01:11:44,205 --> 01:11:47,229
First of all, it is important for them to make up

827
01:11:48,963 --> 01:11:52,612
I want her to call me soon

828
01:11:58,354 --> 01:11:59,893
It's already 2 am

829
01:12:01,385 --> 01:12:03,229
She hasn't come back yet

830
01:12:03,674 --> 01:12:06,487
I will complain if she comes back

831
01:12:07,815 --> 01:12:09,322
You don't have to say anything

832
01:12:09,916 --> 01:12:10,557
I see

833
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,979
I will complain

834
01:12:20,924 --> 01:12:21,791
Sister

835
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:29,791
welcome back

836
01:12:31,612 --> 01:12:32,963
welcome back

837
01:12:44,643 --> 01:12:45,791
Here's Oden restaurant?

838
01:12:56,854 --> 01:13:01,635
Do not serve dishes with such ingredients

839
01:13:05,752 --> 01:13:08,049
Stop it!
Watch out

840
01:13:13,315 --> 01:13:15,510
Stay strong, please.

841
01:13:15,535 --> 01:13:17,635
Help me to bring her upstairs

842
01:13:24,018 --> 01:13:25,034
Watch out

843
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:26,784
Stay strong

844
01:13:30,174 --> 01:13:32,073
You drunk too much

845
01:13:33,978 --> 01:13:39,314
How You could take my guy

846
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,440
Please curse me

847
01:13:43,338 --> 01:13:47,018
I don't sleep yet

848
01:13:50,096 --> 01:13:53,010
Let's take a walk

849
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:55,432
Come on

850
01:14:15,299 --> 01:14:16,635
We're sisters

851
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:20,877
We're only sisters

852
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:23,409
Hisako

853
01:14:25,135 --> 01:14:27,612
We're sisters

854
01:15:04,104 --> 01:15:07,065
Totoichi's boss has arrived

855
01:15:11,791 --> 01:15:13,088
Welcome

856
01:15:13,113 --> 01:15:14,776
How are you?

857
01:15:15,455 --> 01:15:16,682
I need to talk to you.

858
01:15:24,401 --> 01:15:25,471
Have a seat

859
01:15:30,166 --> 01:15:32,002
Thanks for the other day

860
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:37,619
I was worried, but my sisters were able to make up.

861
01:15:38,823 --> 01:15:39,729
That's good

862
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:43,440
I would like to apologize to you for the three of us.

863
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:49,189
I have a request for you about that

864
01:15:49,846 --> 01:15:50,901
What's that?

865
01:15:52,409 --> 01:15:57,463
Kiyo cooks tonight's food

866
01:15:58,713 --> 01:16:04,705
Hisako and Ume are cooking it together in the kitchen now.

867
01:16:09,143 --> 01:16:11,971
It may bother you

868
01:16:13,354 --> 01:16:16,823
I wish the happiness of the three

869
01:16:18,924 --> 01:16:23,963
Please forgive her

870
01:16:27,823 --> 01:16:28,549
But

871
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:33,174
She hasn't cooked for a long time

872
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:39,346
Try eating her food and make a decision

873
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:50,408
If she cooks well, please forgive her

874
01:16:53,010 --> 01:16:54,010
Please

875
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,924
Don't forgive me

876
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:01,580
Thanks for telling me

877
01:17:02,932 --> 01:17:04,479
Thanks

878
01:17:06,619 --> 01:17:10,869
I am very happy to be asked by you

879
01:17:12,987 --> 01:17:13,823
But

880
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,401
I want to see her ability

881
01:17:19,627 --> 01:17:20,807
That's for them too

882
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,721
I will judge her strictly.

883
01:17:44,596 --> 01:17:47,284
Could you serve the food soon?

884
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:50,221
We are ready if they wants

885
01:17:52,073 --> 01:17:53,159
Are you ready?

886
01:18:06,541 --> 01:18:09,979
Totoichi's brother is here

887
01:18:10,401 --> 01:18:11,034
Really?

888
01:18:11,713 --> 01:18:15,830
Our mom would have thought of you

889
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:17,854
So please

890
01:18:18,291 --> 01:18:21,752
I'm cooking now.
don't disturb

891
01:18:24,588 --> 01:18:30,416
The food tastes the same with or without him.

892
01:18:33,229 --> 01:18:36,276
Let me know when sense's speech is done

893
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:41,213
Timing is important for this celebration soup

894
01:18:42,807 --> 01:18:43,948
Is this fine?

895
01:18:46,330 --> 01:18:47,307
Good

896
01:19:11,611 --> 01:19:14,541
Let me greet you

897
01:19:16,314 --> 01:19:22,588
Thanks for coming tonight

898
01:19:23,244 --> 01:19:25,877
I won a literary award.

899
01:19:26,775 --> 01:19:33,666
It is because of your support

900
01:19:34,931 --> 01:19:41,767
I want to thank you guys for what you did for me today.

901
01:19:45,377 --> 01:19:50,822
Thank you very much.
Please enjoy your time

902
01:19:57,861 --> 01:19:59,439
His speech has just finished

903
01:20:00,010 --> 01:20:01,846
Let's go

904
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:12,736
Hi Madam

905
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:16,228
What dish is this?

906
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:17,768
It tastes good

907
01:22:18,025 --> 01:22:20,846
I don't know what dish is this

908
01:22:25,830 --> 01:22:26,596
I tell you

909
01:22:27,932 --> 01:22:32,518
This is TOTOKI's business trip cooking

910
01:22:33,213 --> 01:22:37,424
Female sisters cooked.

911
01:22:38,775 --> 01:22:40,143
We,Totoki grantee this

912
01:22:40,682 --> 01:22:42,986
Please enjoy your meal

913
01:22:43,011 --> 01:22:44,713
Oh, Totoki's

914
01:22:45,064 --> 01:22:46,236
I know them

915
01:22:57,783 --> 01:22:59,822
Kiyo,Hisako

916
01:23:00,338 --> 01:23:04,674
Our guest asked us what dish was it

917
01:23:05,010 --> 01:23:11,252
And Totoki's brother answered him this was Totoki's dish

918
01:23:12,049 --> 01:23:13,103
Sister!

919
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,666
I'm glad

920
01:23:27,143 --> 01:23:28,549
Thank you very much

921
01:23:31,158 --> 01:23:37,025
I cooked hard not to embarrass you.

922
01:23:41,096 --> 01:23:47,088
I'm tired of cooking for the first time.

923
01:23:49,877 --> 01:23:52,666
Keep going cooking, you girls

924
01:23:53,791 --> 01:23:54,619
I know

925
01:23:58,877 --> 01:23:59,658
Brother

926
01:23:59,932 --> 01:24:01,119
Don't say anything

927
01:24:02,557 --> 01:24:04,877
You didn't forget how to cook

928
01:24:07,002 --> 01:24:09,025
Thank you very much

929
01:24:11,596 --> 01:24:13,947
Restaurant to be remodeled tomorrow.

930
01:24:14,650 --> 01:24:17,299
We'll set the sign of Totoki

931
01:24:19,174 --> 01:24:20,135
Sure

932
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:27,588
Thank you very much

933
01:24:31,908 --> 01:24:34,338
I want to ask you something

934
01:24:35,049 --> 01:24:36,166
Tell me

935
01:24:37,275 --> 01:24:40,634
I didn't know Oume is your fiancee

936
01:24:44,033 --> 01:24:48,978
She thinks fiancé is the one who gets paid and does
nothing.

937
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:52,643
How dare you

938
01:24:53,447 --> 01:24:54,611
She is cute

939
01:24:55,822 --> 01:24:57,955
She'll be nice woman later

940
01:24:59,557 --> 01:25:00,627
Don't be glad

941
01:25:00,861 --> 01:25:02,384
You pervert.
I hate you!

942
01:25:05,502 --> 01:25:06,432
I'm glad

943
01:25:07,338 --> 01:25:09,463
Kiyo,Hisako

944
01:25:09,869 --> 01:25:12,385
Please use me when you'll be busy

945
01:25:20,057 --> 01:25:21,057
Let's drink together

946
01:25:21,393 --> 01:25:22,111
Sure

947
01:25:30,228 --> 01:25:32,768
Oume came to me to pick the Miso

948
01:25:33,721 --> 01:25:34,736
Did you cook with it?

949
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:38,689
I need the miso to cook it

950
01:25:38,853 --> 01:25:40,369
Thank you very much

951
01:25:40,643 --> 01:25:42,393
Let's drink

952
01:25:45,385 --> 01:25:46,111
Good job

953
01:25:47,791 --> 01:25:51,510
I'm glad you used our Miso

954
01:25:53,807 --> 01:25:56,088
Was it hard for you to prepare the food?

955
01:25:56,369 --> 01:26:03,377
I spent the morning shopping at various stores.

956
01:26:04,369 --> 01:26:09,002
Totoki's miso is our dead father's favorite
dish.

957
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:14,728
How did you cook it with the Miso?

958
01:26:15,471 --> 01:26:19,650
I can't tell you the secret

959
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,205
You have quite a way with words.

960
01:26:24,830 --> 01:26:25,861
Never mind

961
01:26:26,697 --> 01:26:27,978
I'll know

962
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:30,775
Yes if you can

963
01:26:31,236 --> 01:26:32,299
What?

964
01:26:34,291 --> 01:26:36,283
I'll try

965
01:26:37,096 --> 01:26:38,510
You have quite a way with words.

966
01:26:38,619 --> 01:26:39,908
Sorry

967
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,369
Sensei

968
01:28:09,814 --> 01:28:12,205
I can't beat someone with skill

969
01:28:13,697 --> 01:28:20,041
No matter how stupid you are, people with skills come alive.

970
01:28:21,478 --> 01:28:25,322
Like sister and mother

971
01:28:28,064 --> 01:28:29,033
You too

972
01:29:50,482 --> 01:29:55,551
THE END

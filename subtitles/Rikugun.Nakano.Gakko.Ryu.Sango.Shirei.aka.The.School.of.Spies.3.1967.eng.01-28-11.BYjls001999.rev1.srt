2
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:45,719
Hey!

3
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,297
What's wrong?

4
00:00:59,172 --> 00:01:00,000
Damn it!

5
00:01:19,023 --> 00:01:31,304
The School of Spies 3:
Dragon Three Command

6
00:02:19,872 --> 00:02:20,981
I am Colonel Hidaka.

7
00:02:22,122 --> 00:02:25,661
The colonel left the interior on a special military plane with special orders.

8
00:02:26,177 --> 00:02:27,739
He arrived there on time

9
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,677
He was on his way to Shanghai when he came under terrorist attack.

10
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:35,224
He died in battle along with the warriors who greeted him.

11
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:38,489
You know who the terrorist group is?

12
00:02:39,403 --> 00:02:40,864
We haven't known yet

13
00:02:41,849 --> 00:02:43,888
What is the license plate number of the terror group's small truck?

14
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,989
It was abandoned, so Japanese soldiers investigated.

15
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:55,138
This is the car that was stolen from the site on the day of the incident.

16
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,981
This is a plan to commit the perfect crime.

17
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:00,770
They are pretty tough.

18
00:03:01,513 --> 00:03:03,935
But there is one clue.

19
00:03:05,841 --> 00:03:08,208
The clues are the bullets and shell casings that shot the tires.

20
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:10,388
This this morsel

21
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:16,332
That's right.
It is a military machine gun of 7.63mm in length.

22
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:19,356
One of them is familiar with this gun.

23
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:27,341
This is the one dollar coin found in the terror group's car.

24
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:34,505
There is a number 078 on the back of the coin, which I think means
something.

25
00:03:42,622 --> 00:03:47,176
This is a copy of the coin I made because I thought it would be useful

26
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:52,356
Model rifle mark and $ 1 silver coin

27
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,231
I hope this gives you some clues.

28
00:03:56,645 --> 00:04:00,887
This terrorist organization is certain to have something to do with spy organizations

29
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:07,997
In short,It must have been a special mission to kill Mr. Hidaka.

30
00:04:10,755 --> 00:04:11,544
Actually,Shiina

31
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:13,684
Between you and me

32
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:20,731
We want to quickly resolve the long-term war with mainland China

33
00:04:21,434 --> 00:04:23,762
This is absolutely necessary for us Japan's future

34
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:30,512
There are those on the Chongqing side who are interested in a peace treaty.

35
00:04:31,098 --> 00:04:35,364
Mr. Hidaka was dispatched to discuss with each other

36
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:41,255
Mr. Hidaka gathered information in Shanghai and went to Hong Kong

37
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:43,958
There he was to hold preliminary talks on peace negotiations.

38
00:04:44,715 --> 00:04:49,505
In short,The terrorist attack was to obstruct the preliminary stairs, right?

39
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:54,559
Some people are not happy that Japan and China make peace

40
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,106
They must have interfered to do that

41
00:04:58,286 --> 00:04:58,989
Moreover

42
00:05:00,036 --> 00:05:06,090
There is no doubt that it was the Shanghai military authorities who leaked this information.

43
00:05:08,176 --> 00:05:11,356
Shanghai's secretariat says it will investigate the case thoroughly

44
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:17,575
But We have to send another one for peace negotiations

45
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,872
We decided to investigate this in our own research

46
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:25,911
Shiina

47
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:27,833
I need to ask you

48
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:32,192
Do your best for peace in Japan and Asia

49
00:05:33,755 --> 00:05:34,403
I ask you

50
00:05:36,106 --> 00:05:36,575
Yes

51
00:05:37,145 --> 00:05:40,731
If you succeeded in peace negotiations with the Chongqing side

52
00:05:41,778 --> 00:05:49,411
You first-year students, as well as your juniors, will play an active role in the liberation of Asia.

53
00:05:51,036 --> 00:05:55,247
This is the hope I made this Nakano School

54
00:05:58,044 --> 00:05:59,372
Sugimoto already sent to Nanking

55
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,887
You can contact him

56
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:04,583
By the way

57
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:15,512
This is the equipment developed at Noborito's laboratory

58
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,864
I think this helps you

59
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:32,122
The afternoon of the third day I was already in Shanghai

60
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,903
Since 1845

61
00:06:35,215 --> 00:06:42,301
There was a river between colonies such as the United States and France and Japanese colonies

62
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:48,520
I was staying at a Japanese-owned hotel there

63
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,786
I was transferred to military headquarters.

64
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:01,567
I, Jiro Shiina, arrived today after receiving orders to arrive.

65
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,223
What do you dress?

66
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:07,239
What?

67
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:13,247
When you talk to us, you should wear your military uniform.

68
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:16,755
Mr.Fuwaki, I'm sorry to say this but

69
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,114
We, Nakano School graduates, do not have military uniforms

70
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:21,989
What?

71
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,418
I don't know what's in Kusanagi's mind

72
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:27,442
Listen

73
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,833
This is different from the mainland

74
00:07:31,098 --> 00:07:32,458
Go to a special agency

75
00:07:33,809 --> 00:07:36,660
I was ordered to be assigned to a special agency

76
00:07:37,286 --> 00:07:40,395
The secretariat was in a quiet part of the French colony

77
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:48,739
The organization here was called Tsujii organization

78
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:50,770
Let's get down to business

79
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,208
Do you have any information about the incident in which Colonel Hidaka was attacked?

80
00:07:55,755 --> 00:07:58,801
We are investigating where the information leaked

81
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,481
We haven't got a clue yet

82
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:03,473
Currently suspicious...

83
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:07,294
This person,Zhang

84
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,965
I hear he is very pro-Japanese.

85
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,622
He belongs to the Ochoumei

86
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:19,965
He is involved in these peace talks.

87
00:08:20,239 --> 00:08:23,903
HQ Sasaki was always in contact with him

88
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,309
In short, he knew the information about Hidaka

89
00:08:27,497 --> 00:08:28,231
He knew it

90
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:36,481
But his private life was being monitored secretly by us all the time

91
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,934
We were tapping all his phones

92
00:08:40,481 --> 00:08:44,973
We absolutely knew if he behaved suspiciously

93
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:47,559
How about his family?

94
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:53,630
His wife and children lived in Hong Kong

95
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:57,301
There's only a maid and a cook in his house

96
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:04,395
There is no information that the maid who goes shopping every day has contacted someone

97
00:09:05,075 --> 00:09:11,169
This cook has never left the house

98
00:09:12,012 --> 00:09:15,574
In other words, Zhang himself is suspicious.

99
00:09:18,098 --> 00:09:21,864
But I don't think he's a spy

100
00:09:26,419 --> 00:09:30,825
I first checked his house

101
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,395
And went to town

102
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,262
Stop it

103
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:56,122
It's none of your business

104
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:02,511
Run away

105
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:45,630
Zhang had a daily routine

106
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:55,484
He and the announcer appeal to the public about peace in Asia

107
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,773
It was a job to appear on a promotional program

108
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:09,694
I decided to follow the announcer

109
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,453
There is a phone call for you

110
00:12:25,086 --> 00:12:26,187
To me?
From who?

111
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:27,429
I don't know

112
00:12:41,203 --> 00:12:42,703
Hello?

113
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:46,382
I'm Sugimoto

114
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:49,547
I'm next to you

115
00:12:51,219 --> 00:12:52,414
Oh Sugimoto

116
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:54,617
I was also surprised at first

117
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,492
I know you're in shanghai but I never knew I'd meet here

118
00:12:59,484 --> 00:13:00,359
When did you come here from Nanking?

119
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:01,922
1 hour ago

120
00:13:03,117 --> 00:13:04,664
Look at floor and listen

121
00:13:07,664 --> 00:13:09,383
There is a woman wearing China dress

122
00:13:20,984 --> 00:13:23,594
That long hair one?

123
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:26,953
Yes she is called Chou Meili

124
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:30,195
I was following her actions in Nanjing

125
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,031
There is something secret around her

126
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:38,461
She is here today for something

127
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:40,906
Who's the man?

128
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:42,383
I've never seen him before

129
00:13:43,234 --> 00:13:45,898
Oh, she's going out

130
00:13:46,312 --> 00:13:47,797
Then, good luck

131
00:14:42,765 --> 00:14:43,531
Ah!

132
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:48,648
I'm sorry

133
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,203
Tips

134
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,469
Please

135
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:31,429
Ladies and gentlemen

136
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:33,304
I'm the manager

137
00:17:33,757 --> 00:17:42,818
Someone used a fake number to gain entry here.

138
00:17:43,469 --> 00:17:46,539
So we must conform your membership

139

Right

142
00:18:00,203 --> 00:18:02,234
Thank you.
You

143
00:18:04,984 --> 00:18:06,140
942

144
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:07,547
Alright

145
00:18:08,258 --> 00:18:08,828

Your membership

104

00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:01,507
Alright

153
00:19:01,969 --> 00:19:02,758
Thank you.

154
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,656
048

155
00:19:31,414 --> 00:19:32,304
Thank you.

Thank you.

159
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:33,054
Find 078!

160
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:56,608
He's there!

161
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,633
Catch him

162
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:03,570
Hurry up!

163
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:05,390
Catch him

164
00:21:20,211 --> 00:21:26,804
It means I think the woman Sugimoto chased from Nanjing has something to do with Hidaka's case.

165
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,765
Yes that's my guess

166
00:21:29,828 --> 00:21:33,203
This is a hidden photo taken at the gambling hall

167
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:38,492
He's stainer

168
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:39,953
You know him?

169
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:41,773
He is a German trader

170
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:47,398
Mr. Sasaki of the headquarters is taking care of the request for the Triple Alliance of Japan, Germany and Italy.

171
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,195
Is he a pro-Japanese foreigner?

172
00:21:50,836 --> 00:21:52,226
Yes kind of

173
00:21:52,633 --> 00:21:57,523
He has lived in Japan before and sometimes brings important information

174
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:02,062
But I don't know this foreigner

175
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:04,937
Oh yeah

176
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:13,679
There is one person who is familiar with Shanghai and Nanjing

177
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,281
He is Kawazoe who is Kempeitai Second Lieutenant

178
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,172
I've told you before

179
00:22:31,469 --> 00:22:33,781
He is Shiina Lieutenant from Tokyo

180
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:34,898
Nice to meet you

181
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:39,031
What can I do for you?

182
00:22:41,609 --> 00:22:44,398
Do you know these guys?

183
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:48,515
I don't know

184
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:56,390
I sent the pictures of these two people to Nakano School and asked them to investigate.

185
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:03,937
We decided to keep an eye on Steiner and Kowa broadcast

186
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:34,211
Oh

187
00:23:38,469 --> 00:23:40,508
Thank you for the other day

188
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,687
I was in hurry so I didn't ask you your name

189
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:50,383
Is this yours?

190
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,273
Oh

191
00:23:52,461 --> 00:23:54,508
I thought I lost it

192
00:23:54,797 --> 00:23:56,453
I liked this

193
00:23:57,445 --> 00:23:59,976
Thanks for everything

194
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,500
Are you waiting for someone in Kowa broadcast?

195
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:05,836
So you are working here?

196
00:24:06,242 --> 00:24:07,453
I'm typist here

197
00:24:07,828 --> 00:24:09,812
I'm Akiko Hayashi

198
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:13,937
She is my friend, Kinden.
She's like my sister

199
00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:18,344
Let's have a dinner if you like

200
00:24:18,398 --> 00:24:20,054
Thank you

201
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:25,789
See you

202
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:28,289
Please come with us if you like

203
00:24:28,562 --> 00:24:32,219
Thanks,
But she have to go somewhere

204
00:24:32,492 --> 00:24:34,289
I see.
Then see you

205
00:24:58,195 --> 00:24:59,117
Brandy

206
00:25:21,414 --> 00:25:24,359
Are you here for work?

207
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:28,297
I came here looking for novel material

208
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,226
Wow, what kind?

209
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:32,172
About spy

210
00:25:33,148 --> 00:25:35,594
I thought there was a clue here

211
00:25:37,336 --> 00:25:38,703
Have you been here long?

212
00:25:39,242 --> 00:25:40,562
About 3 yrs

213
00:25:41,281 --> 00:25:41,984
How about your parents?

214
00:25:42,484 --> 00:25:43,656
They are died

215
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:48,016
My father died in shanghai

216
00:25:49,078 --> 00:25:51,117
My mother died when I was 3 years old

217
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:54,859
She dies in here too?

218
00:25:55,383 --> 00:26:00,445
No.
We returned to my mother's hometown after my father died

219
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:05,562
My mother committed suicide in Yokohama

220
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:06,828
Your mother committed suicide?

221
00:26:09,398 --> 00:26:12,430
I found out about it later from my grandmother.

222
00:26:12,797 --> 00:26:15,367
Is the person in the picture your mother?

223
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:17,039
Yes

224
00:26:17,523 --> 00:26:21,281
You're amazing to come to Shanghai alone

225
00:26:22,633 --> 00:26:26,289
I feel sad when I'm in Japan

226
00:26:27,664 --> 00:26:30,898
Do you know Zhang Zi Yuan?

227
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,375
He' brought me here

228
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:38,086
He was very close to my dad. so he is happy to look after me

229
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:40,602
That's good for you

230
00:26:41,367 --> 00:26:42,601
And Kinden is here too

231
00:26:43,797 --> 00:26:47,484
She's also no parents.
We are like sister

232
00:26:48,922 --> 00:26:49,516
I see

233
00:26:52,281 --> 00:26:58,187
At that time, a top secret telegram was sent to the headquarters.

234
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:14,212
I was informed that a second messenger would come from Tokyo for peace negotiations.

235
00:27:15,025 --> 00:27:17,087
I see, so?

236
00:27:18,392 --> 00:27:20,830
I want you to cooperate again

237
00:27:21,244 --> 00:27:22,486
What do you mean?

238
00:27:23,697 --> 00:27:26,962
Don't pretend you don't know. Mr.Zhang

239
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:32,650
I thank you for the recent attack on Colonel Hidaka

240
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:37,626
Many people in the mainland do not want to negotiate peace.

241
00:27:37,837 --> 00:27:40,548
Mr.Sasaki.
You misunderstand something

242
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:45,705
As I told you before. I have nothing to do with the terrorism case

243
00:27:46,305 --> 00:27:48,071
Then let's leave it at that

244
00:27:48,937 --> 00:27:58,219
But You're a member of the Ouchoumei, so you know what happens if Japan and China enter into peace talks.

245
00:28:00,773 --> 00:28:04,016
I get it.
Pretend you can't hear

246
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:10,109
The 2nd messenger,Mr. Kihara, Mr. Sayama, and influential people in the private sector

247
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:15,586
They will arrive at the airport by special plane at 8 o'clock tomorrow morning

248
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,937
Depart for Hong Kong 30 minutes after the plane refuels

249
00:28:25,953 --> 00:28:27,977
I live here.
Thank you

250
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,258
Good night

251
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:38,187
Kinden!

252
00:28:38,836 --> 00:28:39,844
What happened?

253
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:40,820
Damn it!

254
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:42,844
Kinden! Kinden!

255
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,844
Akiko sister

256
00:28:45,869 --> 00:28:46,602
Kinden!

257
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:50,835
Sou's stick

258
00:28:51,203 --> 00:28:51,930
stick?

259
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:54,625
Who shot you?

260
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,398
Kinden! Kinden!

261
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:00,898
Kinden!

262
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:11,094
The right is the ammunition of the Hidaka incident and the left is the ammunition of the KINDEN incident.

263
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:14,180
Compare the marks of these two pistols

264
00:29:15,734 --> 00:29:16,914
It's same

265
00:29:21,016 --> 00:29:27,516
It means The pistols used in these two cases are the 7.6 meter Mauser pistols.

266
00:29:27,984 --> 00:29:31,945
In other words, it ’s the same criminal offense.

267
00:29:33,242 --> 00:29:38,336
And moreover Kinden said before she died about KOWA Broadcasting Sou Announcer

268
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:44,430
Let's investigate it

269
00:29:48,383 --> 00:29:54,641
At 8:41, I was informed that a special military aircraft had crash landed due to an engine failure.

270
00:29:55,922 --> 00:29:57,414
Really?
Where?

271
00:29:59,219 --> 00:30:01,984
According to the telegram, it's around here

272
00:30:03,055 --> 00:30:04,172
Near the Raikochi?

273
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:07,281
That is the base of the communist army

274
00:30:07,617 --> 00:30:08,250
Yes

275
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:09,477
That's strange

276
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:13,289
Why the engine broke down?

277
00:30:14,164 --> 00:30:20,281
I have no idea but Perhaps someone set out on the plane after making adjustments at the airfield.

278
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:21,836
Is it sabotage?

279
00:30:23,258 --> 00:30:24,016
Tsujii lieutenant

280
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:24,859
Yes

281
00:30:25,375 --> 00:30:27,023
Please take Zhang Zi Yuan now

282
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:29,711
I interrogate him on suspicion of being a Communist spy

283
00:30:42,711 --> 00:30:50,062
Mr,Zhang.
I got information that you are being targeted by a secret society in Chongqing

284
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,594
I'm being targeted?

285
00:30:52,281 --> 00:30:54,656
Please go out with us

286
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,500
I will guide you to a safe place

287
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:19,766
Let's examine his house carefully

288
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:41,336
What happened?
Sasaki-san

289
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:44,570
I need to ask you something

290
00:31:53,008 --> 00:31:53,680
Mr.Zhang

291
00:31:54,687 --> 00:31:57,234
When did you become a Communist spy?

292
00:31:57,531 --> 00:31:59,680
What do you mean?

293
00:32:02,125 --> 00:32:04,765
You made a special military plane crash land at a Chinese Communist base

294
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:06,429
Don't pretend you don't know

295
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:07,633
You are a traitor

296
00:32:07,984 --> 00:32:09,219
Please refrain from words

297
00:32:09,664 --> 00:32:11,891
You tricked me into taking me here

298
00:32:13,531 --> 00:32:15,055
You misunderstand something

299
00:34:53,211 --> 00:34:55,047
Do you think I'm a spy?

300
00:34:56,453 --> 00:34:58,219
I was asked to investigate you

301
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:03,461
But Akiko

302
00:35:04,383 --> 00:35:09,578
You'll be free if you like

303
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:10,773
No thanks

304
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,164
You like to be with Shiina

305
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:19,195
Shiina?

306
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:31,765
Pending.
Take her out

307
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:42,898
Ah

308
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,672
I've heard something from Kawazoe

309
00:35:46,828 --> 00:35:48,687
Shiina lieutenant is you

310
00:35:54,820 --> 00:36:02,312
Hsu, the cook, eavesdropped on the secret meeting with this microphone.

311
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:07,039
He hid the note in his CHOU WEI's stick and outside and he
contacted

312
00:36:08,929 --> 00:36:10,195
Who's the other side

313
00:36:10,422 --> 00:36:14,383
I think it's the announcer's SOU who meets with him daily.

314
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,069
Um

315
00:36:17,187 --> 00:36:19,258
Manager,
Your care is ready

316
00:36:21,109 --> 00:36:21,969
Are you going out?

317
00:36:22,422 --> 00:36:25,812
An emergency meeting begins at the command center.

318
00:36:26,562 --> 00:36:29,812
I would like to interrogate her too.

319
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:32,906
Ok leave it to you

320
00:36:52,328 --> 00:36:53,867
fully confess something

321
00:36:57,625 --> 00:36:58,609
Stop it

322
00:36:58,961 --> 00:36:59,820
Let me hit him

323
00:37:00,781 --> 00:37:02,750
I'm in charge of this

324
00:37:03,156 --> 00:37:05,304
In charge?
Who ordered you?

325
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:12,547
I was authorized by the head of the agency.
I will to interrogate him from now on

326
00:37:13,406 --> 00:37:14,789
Leave it to me

327
00:37:31,906 --> 00:37:32,859
Are you OK?

328
00:37:35,906 --> 00:37:39,570
I know that you do not speak out in violence.

329
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:44,867
But you've been caught by us

330
00:37:46,086 --> 00:37:48,601
I think Your mates doubt you

331
00:37:50,461 --> 00:37:53,390
Our work is ruthless with each other.

332
00:37:55,961 --> 00:37:57,000
Do you have your family?

333
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:13,577
It is predicted that the crash landing incident and the Hidaka incident were committed by the same person.

334
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:20,000
Moreover, these two men are necessary for peace negotiations.

335
00:38:21,125 --> 00:38:25,765
The General Staff is doing everything in their power to get them out.

336
00:38:26,414 --> 00:38:27,312
chief of staff

337
00:38:28,633 --> 00:38:32,203
I think we should take down

338
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:32,890
That's right

339
00:38:33,914 --> 00:38:37,312
Are you going to ignore the wishes of the General Staff?

340
00:38:38,617 --> 00:38:43,078
If we attack them, Ensign Kihara will be killed.

341
00:38:45,312 --> 00:38:52,968
It is best to send a special agent to rescue them.

342
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:56,023
I don't agree with you

343
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:56,609
Why?

344
00:38:56,634 --> 00:38:57,961
It's impossible to send there

345
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,054
Take our time and we'll be fine.

346
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:06,336
But prolonged exposure can be dangerous.

347
00:39:07,226 --> 00:39:11,117
Therefore, We should take down them

348
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,187
OK let's decide the date

349
00:39:14,703 --> 00:39:17,937
Rescue operation by special operations personnel will last for 10 days starting today.

350
00:39:18,633 --> 00:39:22,015
7 days ... 8 days are enough

351
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:29,922
OK.
We should think who can be the rescue them

352
00:39:36,289 --> 00:39:38,961
I want to recommend that person

353
00:39:39,953 --> 00:39:41,305
That's what I thought

354
00:39:42,844 --> 00:39:48,766
How did you get the note that HUS puts in this stick?

355
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:55,016
Mr. Zhang always puts his stick in a locker when he comes to the broadcasting station.

356
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,883
I get out before I enter the studio.

357
00:40:01,289 --> 00:40:04,938
Kinden was killed yesterday because she happened to see it

358
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:07,867
I feel sorry for her

359
00:40:09,664 --> 00:40:10,766
Who killed her?

360
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:12,617
I don't know

361
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:13,969
Why?

362
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:19,148
I always just contact them at a fixed place and at a fixed time

363
00:40:20,227 --> 00:40:24,938
Is that place a nightclub gambling place?

364
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,258
Is that gambling place your place?

365
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:32,133
No.
That gambling place was just used for contact

366
00:40:32,438 --> 00:40:33,438
Where's your base?

367
00:40:35,797 --> 00:40:37,203
Somewhere in Kyodo-sokai

368
00:40:38,742 --> 00:40:39,898
Are you hiding it?

369
00:40:40,836 --> 00:40:41,672
No

370
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,203
I like your personality

371
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,367
So I tell you everything I know.

372
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:58,906
Tell me the name of 3 people

373
00:41:04,672 --> 00:41:05,852
I don't know these 2 guys

374
00:41:08,148 --> 00:41:11,359
This is Wu wu song I'm always in contact with

375
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:15,422
Wu wu song

376
00:41:16,906 --> 00:41:17,930
Where is he now?

377
00:41:18,492 --> 00:41:19,828
He's not in Shanghai now

378
00:41:20,617 --> 00:41:23,836
He said he was going to Raikoji yesterday

379
00:41:24,516 --> 00:41:25,250
Raikoji ?

380
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:30,383
Chief is calling you

381
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,430
Will I be that special officer?

382
00:41:36,258 --> 00:41:41,461
I know you are investigating Colonel Hidaka's case

383
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,398
But Mr.Sasaki asked me to recommend you

384
00:41:49,602 --> 00:41:50,727
Can you?

385
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:51,938
Sure

386
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:55,164
I obey orders

387
00:41:56,148 --> 00:41:56,797
I see

388
00:41:57,914 --> 00:41:59,758
How many subordinates do you need?

389
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:01,117
I need no one

390
00:42:02,109 --> 00:42:06,813
Instead, I would like you to call Mr. Sugimoto in Nanjing.

391
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:08,367
Sugimoto?

392
00:42:09,609 --> 00:42:12,656
It ’s your classmate at Nakano School.

393
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:15,430
I see

394
00:42:17,563 --> 00:42:19,484
This is hard work

395
00:42:20,234 --> 00:42:23,289
If you don't like it, please decline

396
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:24,484
I don't care

397
00:42:24,992 --> 00:42:25,984
Don't worry

398
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:29,187
I'm chasing that woman in Nanjing.

399
00:42:29,758 --> 00:42:32,688
Because I think she has something to do with the obstruction of peace work

400
00:42:34,297 --> 00:42:36,141
Let's give God to the waves of trouble

401
00:42:37,086 --> 00:42:40,086
It's like the school song of Nakano School.

402
00:42:41,313 --> 00:42:44,429
By the way, How's Zhang Zi Yuan?

403
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:46,328
He was released

404
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:52,297
Except for the chef Zhang and the announcer So, they were released earlier.

405
00:42:52,773 --> 00:42:53,461
I see

406
00:42:54,109 --> 00:43:00,289
I can see how Zhang Zi Yuan could be targeted by the enemy, but I can't imagine him being a spy for the enemy.

407
00:43:00,914 --> 00:43:02,188
That's good news

408
00:43:06,602 --> 00:43:08,219
Oh you are Chou meili

409
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,797
You are terrible

410
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:13,180
You left me in Nanjing and disappeared

411
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,188
Well..I didn't mean that

412
00:43:18,352 --> 00:43:21,563
Long time no see.
You have your boyfriend here?

413
00:43:22,508 --> 00:43:23,648
I get angry with you

414
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,055
I was looking for you when I went to Shanghai to meet you.

415
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:36,695
I can't forget about you

416
00:43:37,945 --> 00:43:39,078
Really

417
00:43:57,078 --> 00:44:04,367
The next morning me and Sugimoto went to RAIKOJI posing as local residents.

418
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:12,313
I knew this was a difficult job

419
00:44:12,828 --> 00:44:20,203
I was very worried about the existence of Mr. Wu who left Shanghai first.

420
00:45:12,992 --> 00:45:14,195
Go ahead

421
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:23,844
Go ahead

422
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:25,109
Thanks

423
00:45:28,969 --> 00:45:29,945
Hey!

424
00:45:30,492 --> 00:45:31,859
Wait!

425
00:45:32,344 --> 00:45:34,078
Show me your belongings

426
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:42,922
You are deaf

427
00:45:53,836 --> 00:45:54,945
Ok go ahead

428
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,266
go ahead

429
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:49,641
Have you seen this guy?

430
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:52,883
I think he went to Lai gang tsuen

431
00:46:53,336 --> 00:46:54,594
I haven't seen him

432
00:46:54,898 --> 00:46:56,313
I see.
Thanks

433
00:47:01,922 --> 00:47:03,938
Wait.
Are you Japanese?

434
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,016
No way

435
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:10,445
Don't tell a lie.
Japanese move their hands when washing their face

436
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:12,047
Come!

437
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:14,695
Wait!

438
00:47:14,891 --> 00:47:15,828
Wait!

439
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:31,203
What's wrong with this guy?

440
00:47:32,836 --> 00:47:38,163
He's a murderer, but have you seen him?

441
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,929
I've never seen him if he is not local

442
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:47,679
That person should stand out

443
00:47:50,859 --> 00:47:51,726
Thanks

444
00:47:54,703 --> 00:47:57,437
Do you ask me?

445
00:47:57,961 --> 00:47:58,781
Foe what?

446
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:05,984
I knew from the beginning that you were the one with the problem

447
00:48:06,812 --> 00:48:07,406
Me?

448
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:15,202
5 yuan is OK.
I'll catch you for murder

449
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:17,023
murder?

450
00:48:46,164 --> 00:48:46,937
Thanks

451
00:49:18,125 --> 00:49:18,867
Put your hands up

452
00:49:23,031 --> 00:49:24,445
Who are you?

453
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:34,203
I know you are Japanese spy

454
00:49:37,304 --> 00:49:37,992
Approve it?

455
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:40,281
Who told you about me?

456
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:41,883
Say it

457
00:51:05,383 --> 00:51:06,445
Meili

458
00:51:07,422 --> 00:51:12,101
Oh, He thinks I'm a spy

459
00:51:12,126 --> 00:51:13,156
I don't mean that

460
00:51:14,054 --> 00:51:18,718
My job is to investigate outsiders.

461
00:51:19,672 --> 00:51:20,250
Thanks

462
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,211
Excuse me

463
00:51:28,695 --> 00:51:30,031
It can't be helped

464
00:51:31,086 --> 00:51:32,953
How did you find here?

465
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,484
I've wanted to see you

466
00:51:41,258 --> 00:51:41,812
Meili

467
00:52:48,437 --> 00:52:49,882
You tricked me

468
00:52:52,914 --> 00:52:54,758
How dare you are

469
00:52:54,783 --> 00:52:58,843
Chinese girl never love you

470
00:52:59,062 --> 00:53:00,547
Don't get me wrong

471
00:53:36,746 --> 00:53:45,566
I hurriedly arrived at Raikoji on the morning of the third day

472
00:53:49,661 --> 00:53:50,403
Wait

473
00:53:52,583 --> 00:53:56,364
We're special officer from Shanghai

474
00:54:12,059 --> 00:54:13,223
I'm a leader,Chen

475
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:17,895
What's your name?

476
00:54:18,895 --> 00:54:19,778
Wu wu song

477
00:54:20,731 --> 00:54:23,262
Was he on the Shanghai branch roster?

478
00:54:26,887 --> 00:54:28,254
Give me your pistol?

479
00:54:56,879 --> 00:54:59,559
Japanese POWs tomorrow

480
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:06,450
You guys will send back tomorrow

481
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,840
You take care of him

482
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:15,364
Please

483
00:55:15,668 --> 00:55:16,153
Thanks

484
00:55:31,926 --> 00:55:34,457
Is it strange to you?

485
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:40,223
Thanks.
I want to see the face of a prisoner

486
00:55:42,512 --> 00:55:43,879
Ok. come with me

487
00:55:46,622 --> 00:55:48,114
What time do you go to bed?

488
00:55:48,489 --> 00:55:51,176
The bell rings at 9 o'clock

489
00:55:53,458 --> 00:55:55,184
Show him the guy

490
00:55:55,918 --> 00:55:56,559
Sure

491
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:13,684
He seems to be a Japanese spy

492
00:56:13,856 --> 00:56:18,551
We caught him hiding during the day

493
00:56:20,653 --> 00:56:23,129
You are Japanese devil!

494
00:56:55,325 --> 00:56:59,887
Don't spit because he's an important person

495
00:57:20,911 --> 00:57:22,926
Lucky

496
00:57:29,481 --> 00:57:34,074
During the turn-off time

497
01:00:00,122 --> 01:00:00,911
Boss

498
01:00:18,497 --> 01:00:20,005
I'm Wu wu song

499
01:00:20,528 --> 01:00:23,512
Are you Wu wu song?

500
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,481
Let him meet

501
01:00:55,677 --> 01:00:56,427
Shiina!

502
01:01:04,068 --> 01:01:05,060
There's no key

503
01:01:05,278 --> 01:01:07,169
I'll manage it.
Anyway get in the car

504
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:32,302
Sugimoto!

505
01:01:32,935 --> 01:01:34,098
Watch out!

506
01:02:13,935 --> 01:02:14,654
What's wrong?

507
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:15,755
Gasoline has run out

508
01:02:16,177 --> 01:02:17,302
We should go on foot from here

509
01:02:18,208 --> 01:02:19,138
Are you OK.Sugimoto?

510
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:21,435
Are you OK?

511
01:02:42,255 --> 01:02:43,365
What's wrong?

512
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:48,372
This is a minefield

513
01:03:04,677 --> 01:03:08,349
It can't be helped.
Please follow me one by one

514
01:03:08,763 --> 01:03:11,146
I'll be the top, Shiina

515
01:03:12,349 --> 01:03:13,786
I'm not afraid to die

516
01:03:16,279 --> 01:03:19,365
Survive no matter what

517
01:03:20,130 --> 01:03:22,919
Did you forget Kusanagi's words?

518
01:03:24,935 --> 01:03:25,966
You get it?

519
01:04:37,021 --> 01:04:38,529
Don't shoot.
Catch them!

520
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:49,638
Don't let them go.
Catch them!

521
01:05:11,521 --> 01:05:12,208
You

522
01:05:18,177 --> 01:05:19,404
What's wrong?
Sugimoto?

523
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,083
Shiina.
I'll leave the left to you

524
01:05:30,568 --> 01:05:31,294
Sugimoto?

525
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,091
Let's move on

526
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:41,622
Anyone there?

527
01:06:45,646 --> 01:06:52,185
We reached the front of our allies just before the end of the given deadline

528
01:06:53,177 --> 01:06:56,388
Tomorrow afternoon in Shanghai...

529
01:06:57,411 --> 01:06:58,427
Hello?

530
01:06:59,419 --> 01:07:00,654
Oh is that zhang?

531
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:02,005
What can I do for you?

532
01:07:02,232 --> 01:07:04,161
I'm just back from the go

533
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:08,005
There was something strange in my pocket

534
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:11,185
Eh?
Is it written as Buddhahood?

535
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:14,638
Yes. it means I go to die

536
01:07:15,958 --> 01:07:17,013
Do I have any idea?

537
01:07:18,138 --> 01:07:21,857
I think a woman was following me

538
01:07:22,529 --> 01:07:27,005
You're being targeted by the enemy, aren't you?

539
01:07:27,372 --> 01:07:28,615
Actually yes

540
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:31,771
I want to talk to you about that

541
01:07:32,536 --> 01:07:36,091
Eh? I want to see you in person

542
01:07:41,466 --> 01:07:42,974
Hello?
Mr.Zhang?

543
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:45,872
Hello?
Mr.Zhang?

544
01:07:46,888 --> 01:07:54,622
Mr.Zhang's assassination was also due to a 7.63 mm Mauser pistol.

545
01:07:55,630 --> 01:08:00,810
Do you know anything about Mr.Zhang these days?

546
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:02,044
Yes

547
01:08:03,325 --> 01:08:05,286
It was a week ago

548
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:08,943
I was told to get a job at a Steiner company

549
01:08:09,849 --> 01:08:10,856
Steiner company?

550
01:08:11,052 --> 01:08:11,700
Yes

551
01:08:12,646 --> 01:08:17,255
He was disappointed to be suspected of being a spy by the Japanese Army

552
01:08:17,716 --> 01:08:19,935
He was planning to set up a company himself

553
01:08:20,974 --> 01:08:21,443
Then?

554
01:08:22,810 --> 01:08:26,958
I joined the company there as a secretary

555
01:08:27,708 --> 01:08:30,364
And the day before his death

556
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:36,607
I was asked by him to collect Steiner company transaction slips

557
01:08:38,177 --> 01:08:39,403
Do you have The copy of transaction slips?

558
01:08:39,568 --> 01:08:40,521
Yes

559
01:08:47,591 --> 01:08:48,732
Here it is

560
01:08:48,974 --> 01:08:49,935
Let me see

561
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:06,434
This looks like a trading telegram, but it appears to be a code.

562
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:07,341
a code?

563
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:09,411
What does it mean?

564
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:11,255
I have no idea now

565
01:09:12,591 --> 01:09:15,880
But if we have a code book, it's okay

566
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:20,521
Where is the Steiner Company Safe?

567
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:21,622
It's in the president's office

568
01:09:21,802 --> 01:09:22,466
The key?

569
01:09:22,622 --> 01:09:23,614
the president has it

570
01:09:23,732 --> 01:09:24,208
Always?

571
01:09:24,435 --> 01:09:25,169
No

572
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:29,318
When he goes to work, he puts it in the top drawer of his desk

573
01:09:29,654 --> 01:09:34,208
Do I have a chance to look up the safe?

574
01:09:42,404 --> 01:09:43,529
I have an idea

575
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,591
But it's difficult

576
01:09:46,622 --> 01:09:47,489
When?

577
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:49,966
Tomorrow noon

578
01:09:51,481 --> 01:09:57,434
The president always applies for a visit by noon and meets the customer in the afternoon.

579
01:09:58,966 --> 01:10:00,497
That time is your chance

580
01:10:01,091 --> 01:10:05,200
I'm waiting for tomorrow noon

581
01:10:05,630 --> 01:10:07,255
Please let me know when you ready

582
01:10:07,622 --> 01:10:08,161
Sure

583
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,818
But please be careful

584
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:15,013
You are being followed in the same way as Mr. zhang

585
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:18,107
I'll give you this

586
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:25,029
This looks like a fountain pen, but if you press here it will become a pistol

587
01:10:25,404 --> 01:10:29,763
There is a poison here that will surely die within 3 minutes

588
01:10:33,005 --> 01:10:40,387
There is a poison here that will surely die within 3 minutes

589
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,396
I'm sorry

590
01:11:29,044 --> 01:11:30,021
I'm stainer

591
01:11:30,818 --> 01:11:33,185
Meili took the bait?

592
01:11:34,966 --> 01:11:37,279
Ok I get it

593
01:14:14,943 --> 01:14:18,661
The rifle mark of this ammunition was the same Mauser

594
01:14:19,693 --> 01:14:20,490
I see

595
01:14:21,184 --> 01:14:32,442
Colonel Hidaka, KINDEN, and
SOU, SOU announcer, JOU the cook, and Mr. Chang and you, all of you are the same person.

596
01:14:32,794 --> 01:14:35,177
Moreover I noticed later

597
01:14:35,865 --> 01:14:38,865
This was in my pocket before I knew it

598
01:14:40,216 --> 01:14:42,154
This is...

599
01:14:42,708 --> 01:14:47,091
I think MEILI CHOU put this in.

600
01:14:52,599 --> 01:14:53,372
This is letter for you

601
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:54,708
Thank you

602
01:14:58,927 --> 01:15:06,575
This letter was information about the Steiner company from Nakano School

603
01:15:09,146 --> 01:15:10,708
According to this letter

604
01:15:11,357 --> 01:15:17,482
Steiner has lived in Yokohama as a trader since 1910

605
01:15:17,536 --> 01:15:23,263
Then he lived with a Japanese woman

606
01:15:23,880 --> 01:15:27,966
During World War I in 1915

607
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:33,364
He was suspected of being a spy and fled abroad

608
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:37,747
He seems to be the same person as Mr. Hans Berger

609
01:15:43,599 --> 01:15:44,615
Hello?

610
01:15:45,599 --> 01:15:47,146
Yes he's here

611
01:15:47,990 --> 01:15:49,325
Phone call for you

612
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,974
Hello?
I'm Shiina

613
01:15:55,669 --> 01:15:58,490
The call was from Akiko Hayashi

614
01:15:59,474 --> 01:16:05,232
Mr. Steiner seems to have a visitor at 4:30 pm today

615
01:16:37,521 --> 01:16:39,232
Just in case,Please escape from here

616
01:16:41,919 --> 01:16:43,294
The key is in this drawer

617
01:16:45,458 --> 01:16:48,583
Set the intercom.
If you hear voices, run away immediately.

618
01:16:50,122 --> 01:16:50,935
Be safe

619
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:28,904
Boss is here?

620
01:18:29,442 --> 01:18:32,216
No.
He has visitors at reception room now

621
01:18:32,849 --> 01:18:33,841
I see

622
01:19:44,138 --> 01:19:46,021
All right,sir.
I'll see you

623
01:19:46,583 --> 01:19:47,521
Bye

624
01:20:18,083 --> 01:20:19,185
Mr.Steiner?

625
01:20:19,210 --> 01:20:20,591
Mr.Steiner?

626
01:20:26,396 --> 01:20:28,287
Please escape now

627
01:20:29,794 --> 01:20:31,388
Please escape now

628
01:20:32,208 --> 01:20:33,904
Please escape now

629
01:20:38,201 --> 01:20:40,787
What are you doing,Akiko?

630
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:46,599
I know the reason you've come here

631
01:20:46,951 --> 01:20:49,122
What did you do while I was not here?

632
01:20:50,568 --> 01:20:53,920
Who did you contact with at noon?

633
01:21:27,045 --> 01:21:27,779
Freeze

634
01:21:30,037 --> 01:21:30,935
Put your hands up

635
01:21:43,021 --> 01:21:44,607
You dirty, basted

636
01:21:46,412 --> 01:21:47,724
Get in now!

637
01:22:11,138 --> 01:22:12,404
Watch out,Shiina!

638
01:22:30,084 --> 01:22:31,420
Who's her?

639
01:22:33,131 --> 01:22:34,310
She's my mom

640
01:22:35,959 --> 01:22:37,467
What her name is?

641
01:22:38,248 --> 01:22:40,287
Shino Hayashi

642
01:22:40,826 --> 01:22:41,810
Shino

643
01:22:43,451 --> 01:22:44,631
Shino

644
01:22:46,474 --> 01:22:47,748
Where's she now?

645
01:22:48,803 --> 01:22:50,053
She's passed away

646
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,404
She's passed away?

647
01:22:55,357 --> 01:23:04,068
You are Hans Belgel

648
01:23:09,178 --> 01:23:10,435
So I tell you

649
01:23:11,521 --> 01:23:16,881
She committed suicide because you doubted her as spy

650
01:23:18,756 --> 01:23:23,154
Because of you, the world suspected her of being a spy.

651
01:23:26,185 --> 01:23:33,342
I still love her

652
01:23:35,256 --> 01:23:43,404
I was just standing up for what I believe in.

653
01:23:45,521 --> 01:23:47,271
You are Steiner belgel

654
01:23:49,256 --> 01:23:56,920
I'll give you this

655
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:19,123
Order No. 13: My mission is over.

656
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:26,803
From that day on, I never heard anything about peace talks again.

657
01:25:27,467 --> 01:25:28,428
Not only that...

658
01:25:28,771 --> 01:25:34,560
It was because of the General Staff's plan to negotiate a peace deal.

659
01:25:36,193 --> 01:25:39,865
I have been summoned by the General Staff this time.

660
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:44,349
I will train them when I get to the interior.

661
01:25:46,865 --> 01:25:50,584
We must band together.

662
01:26:09,889 --> 01:26:12,553
RAIKOJI is occupied.

663
01:26:13,381 --> 01:26:19,717
Lt. Kusanagi from Tokyo and I went there.

664
01:26:31,873 --> 01:26:35,943
Rest in piece, Sugimoto

665
01:26:40,045 --> 01:26:43,615
I must say sorry to you

666
01:26:44,974 --> 01:26:52,123
The peace process you opposed was forced upon you by the Army.

667
01:26:54,084 --> 01:26:55,889
I must say sorry to you

668
01:26:59,928 --> 01:27:03,318
How Japan will happen later?

669
01:27:05,045 --> 01:27:07,842
The war will grow.

670
01:27:09,185 --> 01:27:13,357
War will expand from mainland China to the South China Sea and then to the Pacific Ocean.

671
01:27:15,099 --> 01:27:19,256
We must make up our mind

672
01:27:20,998 --> 01:27:24,084
We must shape our future.

673
01:27:26,201 --> 01:27:31,303
I remember what Sugimoto said.

674
01:27:32,701 --> 01:27:36,295
God please give me freedom.

675
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,881
God please give me freedom.

676
01:27:51,615 --> 01:27:58,326
THE END

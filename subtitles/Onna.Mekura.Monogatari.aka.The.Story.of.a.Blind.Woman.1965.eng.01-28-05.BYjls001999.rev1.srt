00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:28,260
It was a fall when I was sixteen years old.

3
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:39,027
I saw the sign of a late woman in the fall of my sixteenth year, and shortly afterwards I was suddenly blinded by an illness.

4
00:00:42,353 --> 00:00:48,266
My parents left me early and I was left on my own.

5
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,562
For a while, I thought I was going crazy with sadness and despair.

6
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:12,059
But then I changed my mind and practiced, and it was worth it.

7
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:20,060
Soon after, I began working as a masseuse on the downstream floor of Yotsuya Tsunokami.

8
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:38,876
But there were those who made fun of me and misbehaved because I am a woman.

9
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,277
I sometimes feel deeply saddened.

10
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:47,263
Why are men like this?

11
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:54,377
No matter how blind I am, it's still a terrible thing to do

<i>Onna Mekura Monogatari / The Story of a Blind Woman (1965)</i>

13
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,540
Be careful.

14
00:03:49,591 --> 00:03:50,844
Here it is.

15
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:52,789
Thank you.

16
00:03:53,028 --> 00:03:53,975
Where are you going?

17
00:03:54,055 --> 00:03:55,681
Up there, in the waiting area.

18
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,330
Come with me.

19
00:04:01,112 --> 00:04:02,792
I'll give you my hands.

20
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,410
Thank you.

21
00:04:09,135 --> 00:04:12,255
That's a cold wind.
It must be hard to be at work now, isn't it?

22
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:14,379
But I'm used to it.

23
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:29,901
I'll leave here.

24
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:32,594
Thank you very much for your kindness.

25
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:33,852
I'll visit here too.

26
00:04:34,136 --> 00:04:35,422
Oh really?

27
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,815
Please take care of it.

28
00:04:45,383 --> 00:04:47,070
Thank you very much.

29
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:49,376
Come here and take some rests.

30
00:04:52,956 --> 00:04:57,476
The guy who just came here.
Is he our regular customer?

31
00:04:57,686 --> 00:04:59,026
Why?

32
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:02,452
He saved me from falling down a stone staircase.

33
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:05,082
He was very kind.

34
00:05:05,112 --> 00:05:08,066
He is Kigoshi.
He sometime visits us.

35
00:05:08,994 --> 00:05:10,060
Kigoshi?

36
00:05:11,362 --> 00:05:14,635
What's wrong?
You're red all the way up to your ears.

37
00:05:14,907 --> 00:05:16,194
It's a frostbite.

38
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,481
Two dishes please.

39
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:20,529
Go to see Momiji.

40
00:05:20,735 --> 00:05:21,748
I get it.

41
00:05:21,773 --> 00:05:23,702
They are drinking so be careful.

42
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,332
Momiji?
Hara is here?

43
00:05:27,512 --> 00:05:27,939
Yes.

44
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,657
He's bad customer...

45
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,579
Where's masseuse?

46
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,086
I'm sorry. Please help me.

47
00:05:48,566 --> 00:05:50,853
She's blind.

48
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:53,671
Oops, excuse me.

49
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,457
Where's her?

50
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,315
You are saved.

51
00:06:01,619 --> 00:06:02,499
Sorry.

52
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:09,374
Thank you very much for your help.

53
00:06:10,159 --> 00:06:13,905
You're a beauty.
You're too good for a girl from around here.

54
00:06:15,285 --> 00:06:17,245
Excuse me.

55
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:27,514
He's too drunk.
Can you help us?

56
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,620
Can you take her to me?

57
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:32,706
I'll get just one drink and go home.

58
00:06:33,004 --> 00:06:34,204
Thank you very much.

59
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:35,510
Ok, tsuru?

60
00:06:35,643 --> 00:06:36,383
Yes.

61
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:37,750
Are you called Tsuru?

62
00:06:39,063 --> 00:06:44,330
She's great worker..
She can handle all of our customers.

63
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,793
So please.

64
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:47,413
Yes.

65
00:06:52,534 --> 00:06:54,787
Do you know what work I do?

66
00:06:55,434 --> 00:06:57,580
I have no idea.

67
00:06:58,184 --> 00:07:00,410
Are you sales man?

68
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:01,548
Why?

69
00:07:02,938 --> 00:07:06,251
Because you smell good.

70
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:08,833
That's true.

71
00:07:09,746 --> 00:07:10,672
It's cold, isn't it?

72
00:07:12,285 --> 00:07:13,105
Let's have drink.

73
00:07:13,505 --> 00:07:17,818
I can't drink at all.

74
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:36,555
Why don't you call some Geisha girls?

75
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:39,101
It's ok if I leave.

76
00:07:39,274 --> 00:07:40,254
Don't worry.

77
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,068
Kikuchi always take care of you?

78
00:07:46,614 --> 00:07:48,207
When I was a kid, we were neighbors.

79
00:07:49,313 --> 00:07:53,573
Whenever I get stressed out, I come here.

80
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:05,226
You look a little sad, don't you?

81
00:08:06,745 --> 00:08:07,372
Why?

82
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,222
There's a pause for a drink.

83
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,202
I get it.

84
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,150
It's like you know what's going on in my mind.

85
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,763
No way.

86
00:08:25,029 --> 00:08:28,629
I'm lost in a lot of things right now.

87
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,056
If you know,just tell me.

88
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,501
You're leaving a woman, aren't you?

89
00:08:39,081 --> 00:08:42,941
That's why you're lonely.
I'm sorry if I'm wrong.

90
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:44,969
Why you think so?

91
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:52,132
Your ring, which was there when you pulled me off the stone steps, was gone when you covered for me earlier.

92
00:08:55,236 --> 00:08:57,296
I didn't want to see the ring, so I took it off.

93
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:00,840
I'm thinking of getting divorced.

94
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:05,092
When business goes bad, everything falls apart.

95
00:09:06,565 --> 00:09:08,225
Life is like building blocks.

96
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:16,642
That day, my wife and I had a fight over a trivial matter.

97
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:24,182
I thought I'd expand my business to hold her down, and that's when I made a mistake.

98
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,719
Not caring about people can actually make or break you for the rest of your life.

99
00:09:32,512 --> 00:09:34,432
You'd better watch out because you're young.

100
00:09:35,439 --> 00:09:35,979
I will.

101
00:09:38,254 --> 00:09:40,487
Sorry to complain about this.

102
00:09:42,462 --> 00:09:48,735
If you are here, could you call me again?

103
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,100
Why?

104
00:09:51,022 --> 00:09:53,569
Your story is very intimate.

105
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:56,557
I don't feel like you are a customer.

106
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
I was hoping you could tell me more.

107
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,590
I don't feel like you are massagist.

108
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:08,547
I'll ask you to come.
I'm glad to know you.

109
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,835
Please.

110
00:10:11,462 --> 00:10:16,215
But if I see a beautiful person like you often...
I might fall in love with you.

111
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,528
Shall I massage you?

112
00:10:21,848 --> 00:10:22,495
Please.

113
00:10:36,324 --> 00:10:44,641
I couldn't help but shiver as I rubbed his shoulders tonight.

114
00:10:46,098 --> 00:10:57,337
When he held me to get rid of a drunken man
I think it must have been because I felt the man before I felt the customer.

115
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:05,873
He told me that one moment can change a person's whole life.

116
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:16,811
What happened tonight will have a profound effect on me for the rest of my life.

117
00:11:31,615 --> 00:11:32,902
What's your name?

118
00:11:33,835 --> 00:11:35,822
I'm Itoko Yamaguchi.

119
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,423
How long have you been working this job?

120
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,003
3 years.

121
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:42,753
You can rub my shoulder.

122
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:45,088
I have to take a test?

123
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:46,708
I have 3 years experiences.

124
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:50,991
3 years experiences are not enough.

125
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,554
But I've never rubbed the shoulders of someone as famous as you.

126
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,313
I'm horned.

127
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,848
Are you blind?

128
00:11:58,935 --> 00:11:59,768
Yes.

129
00:11:59,848 --> 00:12:01,708
Why you wear sun glass?

130
00:12:04,456 --> 00:12:05,636
How you know?

131
00:12:05,902 --> 00:12:08,469
I know you just sticked out your tongue.

132
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:17,296
Put more pressure on your thumb.

133
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:22,216
Like this?

134
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,260
You've got the body of a 20-something.

135
00:12:29,721 --> 00:12:31,475
I feel hard to massage you.

136
00:12:37,237 --> 00:12:38,271
Have some noodles?

137
00:12:38,537 --> 00:12:39,251
No.

138
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,623
I'm hungry.
I'll have it.

139
00:12:50,541 --> 00:12:52,461
That's enough.

140
00:12:53,236 --> 00:12:54,476
Thanks.

141
00:12:55,656 --> 00:12:57,837
We can't hire you.

142
00:12:58,274 --> 00:12:59,580
Why not?

143
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,519
Your skills are not good enough.

144
00:13:06,154 --> 00:13:10,120
I've been working a lot of places.

145
00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:16,385
I know you worry about her skills but please consider some more.

146
00:13:17,045 --> 00:13:20,305
We don't have enough workers.

147
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:23,684
I think we can hire her.

148
00:13:23,964 --> 00:13:25,277
She can't massage well.

149
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,683
She came here all the way.

150
00:13:28,202 --> 00:13:31,469
You're serious about your training, aren't you?

151
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:35,192
I've never screwed up before.

152
00:13:35,726 --> 00:13:37,213
I think we can hire her.

153
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:40,048
Would you take money for such a skill?

154
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:04,149
I'm home.

155
00:14:04,174 --> 00:14:04,895
Welcome home.

156
00:14:05,275 --> 00:14:06,422
Was it cold?

157
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:10,832
He was a very nice customer, and I got a nice tip.

158
00:14:12,026 --> 00:14:13,313
Here it is.

159
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:14,313
Thanks.

160
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:18,466
I'm Itoko.
I'll work here from today.

161
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:21,388
I'm Tsuruko.
Nice to meet you.

162
00:14:21,782 --> 00:14:24,562
I'm going to make a lot of money.

163
00:14:25,446 --> 00:14:28,219
Why don't you sit down and eat?

164
00:14:34,318 --> 00:14:35,771
I'm home.

165
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:36,949
Welcome home.

166
00:14:37,327 --> 00:14:38,774
Take some rests.

167
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:40,461
Good night.

168
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,854
Tsuruko.

169
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:48,768
You seem awfully excited.
Your footsteps are different. Did something happen?

170
00:14:49,181 --> 00:14:51,061
It's nothing.

171
00:14:51,795 --> 00:14:53,021
I'm home.

172
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,380
Welcome home.
have some noodles.

173
00:14:54,494 --> 00:14:55,460
I don't want.

174
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,347
I've just been treating a client to cake.

175
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:03,897
That's nice of you,
My clients asked me too much to massage.

176
00:15:04,431 --> 00:15:07,051
And told me to discount 100 yen.

177
00:15:08,679 --> 00:15:10,439
Let's go to bed.

178
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,643
Good night.

179
00:15:12,668 --> 00:15:13,453
Good night.

180
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:15,986
Keep reading.

181
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:16,939
OK.

182
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:25,952
I did receive the 2,000 yen.
Thank you.

183
00:15:27,326 --> 00:15:33,967
I'm so grateful for Hisae's monthly contribution to my school fund.
I'm very motivated!

184
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:38,072
I will ask for your help again next month.

185
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:42,747
Please take care of yourself for me.
Good bye!

186
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:48,803
Are you ok with her?
You seem to be his ATM.

187
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:51,602
You're rude.
He's nice man.

188
00:15:53,757 --> 00:15:59,964
He was so kind to me last day.

189
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:02,601
I can't say about it anymore.

190
00:16:02,817 --> 00:16:06,444
You lost your virgin?

191
00:16:08,852 --> 00:16:09,838
Good night.

192
00:16:19,502 --> 00:16:21,522
I wanna see him.

193
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,425
Don't make your voice sound so irresistible.

194
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:51,877
What is this all about?

195
00:16:56,150 --> 00:17:05,010
I have heard and done many lewd things in the past, but nothing has ever aroused my interest in such things.

196
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:14,154
But tonight, I can't help but feel dreamy and enchanted all over my body.

197
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:23,115
I had given up on being human, but perhaps the flames of love have been kindled in me.

198
00:17:24,222 --> 00:17:27,189
Is this what a woman's heart is like?

199
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,888
Good morning.

200
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:51,843
Wake up.

201
00:17:54,184 --> 00:17:56,830
Come on, you, get up.

202
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,258
Get ready!

203
00:18:41,044 --> 00:18:44,684
I'm surprised.
This family uses their apprentice as a maid.

204
00:18:44,885 --> 00:18:47,659
They like to do it.

205
00:18:49,123 --> 00:18:50,043
I see.

206
00:18:53,694 --> 00:18:55,234
Come on, help me out.

207
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:57,227
I don't want to get my hands dirty.

208
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:03,325
She's cheeky.

209
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:06,271
I don't feel like working with her.

210
00:19:08,057 --> 00:19:10,244
Would you like to go to the department store with me today?

211
00:19:11,342 --> 00:19:13,176
I'm going to the salon.

212
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,637
You're out of your mind.
You've been so nervous all morning.

213
00:19:54,399 --> 00:19:56,985
No..stop it.

214
00:19:59,632 --> 00:20:01,245
No..stop it.

215
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:04,478
I feel ticklish.

216
00:20:06,251 --> 00:20:08,225
This is our way.

217
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:10,597
Remember this.

218
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:19,353
You're mean.

219
00:21:19,382 --> 00:21:20,295
I'm home.

220
00:21:20,502 --> 00:21:21,322
Welcome home.

221
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:23,220
Vegetables are so expensive these days.

222
00:21:23,245 --> 00:21:27,580
I had my head done.
Do you think it looks good?

223
00:21:27,608 --> 00:21:29,581
It's nice.

224
00:21:30,394 --> 00:21:31,354
Madam.

225
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:35,125
I am..

226
00:21:35,150 --> 00:21:36,525
You're weird.

227
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:47,786
Welcome home.

228
00:21:47,859 --> 00:21:48,453
I'm home.

229
00:21:48,716 --> 00:21:50,823
I'm having teacher teach me about pressure points right now.

230
00:21:51,382 --> 00:21:53,115
He's so great.

231
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:57,168
You have to study up and get some clients.

232
00:22:11,118 --> 00:22:12,558
You work hard.

233
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:17,084
Teacher gave compliment to you.

234
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:19,878
Why you are upset?

235
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:23,835
I have no idea.

236
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,738
She became a cook's maid and went to a lot of trouble to get him to where he is today.

237
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:31,019
So what?

238
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,026
I thought you should know.

239
00:22:33,074 --> 00:22:34,089
It's none of my business.

240
00:22:35,082 --> 00:22:35,964
Itoko

241
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,433
You look scared.

242
00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,949
Why don't you find someone else?

243
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:44,582
Then you won't look so scared.

244
00:22:45,761 --> 00:22:49,933
But you're blind, so you can't see the face of the one you care about.

245
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:14,958
I've been dying to meet him every day since then.

246
00:23:17,716 --> 00:23:24,848
If I weren't blind, I would have gone to see him or asked him to come to me.

247
00:23:25,161 --> 00:23:26,653
But I can't.

248
00:23:28,294 --> 00:23:37,294
The sadness of waiting patiently for the call to come.
You have to be a masseuse to understand this pain.

249
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:40,959
I miss him.

250
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,506
I want him to say a word to Tsuru-chan.

251
00:23:48,186 --> 00:23:49,139
What are you doing?

252
00:23:49,241 --> 00:23:52,076
Stop being so jealous!
You're old enough...

253
00:23:53,123 --> 00:23:55,006
You're old enough.

254
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:56,560
Because of Itoko,Shigeo left here.

255
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:57,491
You are stupid.

256
00:23:57,928 --> 00:24:00,303
SHIGEO resigned because Yae left.

257
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,647
He says if you kick Itoko out , he'll come back.

258
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,912
I don't accept him.

259
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:06,959
I have pride now.

260
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:08,686
You are stupid.

261
00:24:08,857 --> 00:24:11,920
I know what you and her do here every day.

262
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,272
You are stupid.

263
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:14,764
I'm home.

264
00:24:14,967 --> 00:24:16,147
Welcome back.

265
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,701
It's late, so go to sleep.

266
00:24:17,881 --> 00:24:20,209
Okay, I'll see you later, good night.

267
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:22,491
Tsuru！

268
00:24:23,116 --> 00:24:24,725
Do you know a man called Mr. Kigoshi?

269
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:25,850
Mr. Kigoshi?

270
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,092
He called earlier and said he's at kohana.

271
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:34,631
It's been an hour already.
I've got ITOKO going instead.

272
00:24:38,948 --> 00:24:39,932
Itoko?

273
00:25:29,781 --> 00:25:34,398
Kohana-san?
I wonder if Kigoshi-san's there...

274
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:38,711
Me?

275
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,062
I am...

276
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:02,503
Tsuruko.
Tonight's guest is very handsome.

277
00:26:03,027 --> 00:26:04,714
He was disappointed you didn't show up.

278
00:26:05,652 --> 00:26:07,144
Treat me Ramen.

279
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:11,902
I'll eat.

280
00:26:13,644 --> 00:26:15,995
Was he alone?

281
00:26:16,035 --> 00:26:16,730
Yes.

282
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,636
Did you massage him?

283
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:23,034
Just back,not legs.

284
00:26:23,472 --> 00:26:25,785
He said he needed you.

285
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:26,902
Stupid.

286
00:26:29,027 --> 00:26:30,214
Won't you eat?

287
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,027
I don't want.

288
00:26:32,058 --> 00:26:34,120
Let me eat this.

289
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,956
Did you notice anything unusual about him?

290
00:26:41,136 --> 00:26:42,870
Nothing at all.

291
00:26:43,683 --> 00:26:49,511
I was thinking about seducing him, but he always talked about you.

292
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,441
What he said?

293
00:26:53,081 --> 00:26:54,401
You love him?

294
00:26:54,433 --> 00:26:56,089
Don't talk to me like that.

295
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:57,675
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:15,241
What's this?

297
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:18,905
It's a gold badge.
I found it on the floor.

298
00:27:19,257 --> 00:27:20,155
Kigoshi's?

299
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,070
It could be.

300
00:27:21,577 --> 00:27:25,945
You know, our teacher told you never to touch a customer's goods

301
00:27:26,093 --> 00:27:27,827
He didn't tell me not to pick it up.

302
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,171
please return this.

303
00:27:29,296 --> 00:27:30,655
It's none of your business.

304
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,437
I'm sure he's looking for it.

305
00:27:33,749 --> 00:27:35,445
please return this.

306
00:27:36,718 --> 00:27:39,937
Give me 500 yen.
You can buy it and do whatever you want with it.

307
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,655
Thank you.

308
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:01,379
Take care.

309
00:28:06,176 --> 00:28:08,286
Thank you very much.

310
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:14,919
Excuse me, is Kigoshi-san here?

311
00:28:15,177 --> 00:28:17,520
He's just leaving.

312
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:12,138
Excuse me.

313
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,544
Massagist.

314
00:29:18,569 --> 00:29:19,920
What's wrong?

315
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:23,366
I have a favor to ask your sister Kikuchi.

316
00:29:23,944 --> 00:29:24,827
Sis.

317
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,319
Oh you.

318
00:29:30,905 --> 00:29:32,303
Can I help you?

319
00:29:32,506 --> 00:29:38,740
I heard you have been friends with a Mr. Kigoshi since childhood.
Is that true?

320
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:41,780
Nihonbashi's.
What's wrong with him?

321
00:29:42,248 --> 00:29:49,702
I'm sorry, but could you please call them and ask when they will be here next time?

322
00:29:49,881 --> 00:29:52,397
Please make the call yourself.

323
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:58,170
But I'm a Massagist.
I don't want the company to know.

324
00:29:58,608 --> 00:30:01,780
They don't care if you're a masseuse or a maid.

325
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,444
You know what?

326
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:10,675
Really?

327
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,855
Masseuses these days are very proactive.

328
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:15,144
They are whore.

329
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:17,035
Don't say bullshit.

330
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,839
Excuse me.

331
00:30:19,864 --> 00:30:22,082
Hold on.
I'll call him.

332
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:24,435
Thank you very much.

333
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,575
Come in.

334
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:31,067
I'm sorry.
I said a lot of things.

335
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:32,778
No, of course not.

336
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:43,362
I'll just ask when he's coming next time.?

337
00:30:43,387 --> 00:30:46,119
I have something for him.

338
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,518
Hello? Mr. President is there?

339
00:30:51,978 --> 00:30:52,673
He's there.

340
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:58,236
Hello, this is Kikuchi.

341
00:30:58,611 --> 00:31:00,502
You've been busy for a while.

342
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:04,970
No, it's not that.
There's someone who wants to see you today.

343
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:07,548
She wants to know when you'll be here.

344
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,611
He wants to talk with you.

345
00:31:19,861 --> 00:31:24,681
Hello?
This is Tsuruko.

346
00:31:28,332 --> 00:31:31,925
Are you coming tonight?
Really?

347
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,362
Are you sure you don't want to leave?

348
00:31:46,917 --> 00:31:51,292
If I leave, I'll have to go to work, so I'll just wait here.

349
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,464
He's late, he said he'd call you here.

350
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:00,221
What's wrong with Tsuruko?

351
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:03,839
She also feels frustrated with Itoko.

352
00:32:04,518 --> 00:32:08,136
Toyoko also said she wanted to quit here.

353
00:32:08,542 --> 00:32:12,003
Don't get angry

354
00:32:14,011 --> 00:32:14,839
I'm home.

355
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:16,237
Welcome home.

356
00:32:18,073 --> 00:32:21,073
Don't read my magazines without asking.

357
00:32:21,604 --> 00:32:24,354
This isn't funny at all.

358
00:32:26,628 --> 00:32:28,182
Please don't throw this at me.

359
00:32:47,171 --> 00:32:50,093
Chihaya needs you.
Itoko, go there.

360
00:32:50,789 --> 00:32:51,898
You out too?

361
00:32:52,015 --> 00:32:55,312
I'm going to Kojimachi for treatment.
Could you pick up a car for me on the street?

362
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:57,898
Get my the bag.

363
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:00,437
You're blind.

364
00:33:06,206 --> 00:33:10,198
We have a bad reputation because of her.

365
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:13,057
No wonder you're so mad, Mom.

366
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:16,307
Okay, I'm definitely quitting.

367
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,200
I'm going to go take a bath, please.

368
00:33:26,669 --> 00:33:28,388
Please.

369
00:33:42,573 --> 00:33:43,260
Hello?

370
00:33:44,807 --> 00:33:49,073
I'm sorry, no one is available.

371
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:27,372
Then I waited for a long time.
But at last he didn't call me back.

372
00:34:29,638 --> 00:34:40,513
Perhaps I am selfishly imagining his feelings and worrying about them on my own.

373
00:35:06,895 --> 00:35:12,442
Itoko ran away from here with her luggage.

374
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:20,091
Did you really go to Kojimachi for treatment?

375
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,153
If you have any doubts, please call them.

376
00:35:22,364 --> 00:35:25,825
I guess you're going to live with her without telling me.

377
00:35:25,887 --> 00:35:29,434
Don't say bullshit.

378
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:46,733
Itoko stole 50,000 yen?

379
00:35:47,842 --> 00:35:50,788
It's our reputation on the line.

380
00:35:50,999 --> 00:35:56,444
Can we assume that she stole from the guests while he's sleeping and then returned here to retrieve her belongings?

381
00:35:56,928 --> 00:35:58,163
I'm sorry.

382
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,022
Can you come to police?

383
00:36:02,381 --> 00:36:08,725
I'll reimburse you for the money, and we'll call it a settlement.

384
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,509
Soon after a hard winter at work, spring has come

385
00:36:40,574 --> 00:36:47,910
But not only did I never see him again, he never called me back.

386
00:36:49,371 --> 00:36:56,801
Rumor had it that his company was going under and might go out of business.

387
00:36:57,691 --> 00:37:01,348
I was blind and there was nothing I could do about it.

388
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:14,011
I started saving money so that I could heal my eyes and have her as a normal woman for even one day.

389
00:37:15,879 --> 00:37:23,496
If I open my eyes, will he tell me I'm still beautiful?

390
00:37:24,613 --> 00:37:27,871
Will he be kinder to me than before?

391
00:38:05,782 --> 00:38:06,946
Tsuru?

392
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,735
Oh Kigoshi?

393
00:38:12,664 --> 00:38:13,805
Why you are here?

394
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:16,703
I'm here with everyone at the annual consolation party.

395
00:38:17,844 --> 00:38:19,344
What a incident.

396
00:38:19,938 --> 00:38:21,563
Let's go there.

397
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:37,384
I thought I'd never see you again.

398
00:38:38,712 --> 00:38:39,365
Where are you staying?

399
00:38:39,672 --> 00:38:40,952
Kinsaikan.

400
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,333
I'm staying at the Hotel New Ocean.

401
00:38:44,628 --> 00:38:46,161
Are you with someone from work?

402
00:38:47,341 --> 00:38:47,921
I'm alone.

403
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,316
Business is not going well. I'm pissed off. I was driving around.

404
00:38:56,039 --> 00:38:59,219
But it was a close call.
I almost hit you.

405
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:04,294
I don't think it's a disaster if I get hit by your car

406
00:39:09,121 --> 00:39:11,114
Would you like to drive with me?

407
00:39:11,461 --> 00:39:14,261
Please drive fast.

408
00:39:24,786 --> 00:39:26,813
Aren't you afraid to go too fast?

409
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:30,826
I'm fine with you.

410
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,850
I thought I'd return this.

411
00:39:39,031 --> 00:39:41,664
I don't need it anymore.

412
00:39:42,457 --> 00:39:43,471
I'll give it to you.

413
00:39:44,517 --> 00:39:45,750
I’m glad.

414
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:02,705
Are you alright?

415
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:04,758
Yes.

416
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:07,846
I'll drive faster.

417
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:09,553
Yes.

418
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,456
By any chance.

419
00:40:15,523 --> 00:40:16,083
What?

420
00:40:18,942 --> 00:40:20,455
We might fall into the sea.

421
00:40:24,218 --> 00:40:26,765
I don't care if I die.

422
00:41:04,872 --> 00:41:06,486
It's pour raining.

423
00:41:10,494 --> 00:41:13,960
Sorry if I drove fast.

424
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:18,020
I was crazy.

425
00:41:19,629 --> 00:41:23,882
The moment I saw your face, I got myself return.

426
00:41:24,228 --> 00:41:25,668
Because I am blind?

427
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:28,771
I was so focused.

428
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:31,212
You lied.

429
00:41:31,967 --> 00:41:32,454
What?

430
00:41:32,815 --> 00:41:38,855
I knew it.
Your heart was pounding when I touched you.

431
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:42,962
You tried to die.

432
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:49,081
I could have died.
I wasn't afraid.

433
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:55,033
But you felt sorry for me  because I am blind, and you couldn't dive into sea.

434
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:58,414
I'm sorry. I'm just finally getting the hang of it.

435
00:41:58,992 --> 00:42:03,705
About the job or about the girl?

436
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:08,035
Forget it.
I promise not to do anything stupid again.

437
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:12,949
I wish I could see.

438
00:42:14,304 --> 00:42:18,224
If I did, you might treat me like a woman.

439
00:42:19,909 --> 00:42:21,589
I don't care if you are blind.

440
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,544
You and I will meet when I'm confused.

441
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:29,867
I mean, when I'm blind in my mind's eye.

442
00:42:30,544 --> 00:42:31,970
We're same.

443
00:42:31,995 --> 00:42:33,170
You think so?

444
00:42:35,578 --> 00:42:39,831
There once was a couple of ugly Blind beggars.

445
00:42:40,049 --> 00:42:40,929
It's a fairy tale.

446
00:42:41,969 --> 00:42:46,829
But the villagers, out of mischief, told them they were the most beautiful couple in the world.

447
00:42:47,265 --> 00:42:49,579
They believed it and were very happy.

448
00:42:50,741 --> 00:42:56,728
And then the great doctor came in and opened their eyes.

449
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,611
They must have been disappointed.

450
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:08,699
So they went back to the blind again, and this time they felt sorry for the villagers who could see the dirt.

451
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:14,199
Okay, I'll stop worrying about my eyes.

452
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:23,404
But if I are not blind...
We might not be able to stay as we are.

453
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:27,651
At least you'll be far away from me

454
00:43:29,018 --> 00:43:30,058
You're beautiful.

455
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,524
The rain stop.

456
00:43:35,131 --> 00:43:36,071
Yeah.

457
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:38,726
I'll send you.

458
00:43:38,793 --> 00:43:39,779
Thanks.

459
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,259
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

460
00:43:51,539 --> 00:43:53,213
Here's evening paper.

461
00:43:54,226 --> 00:43:56,273
Thanks.

462
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:09,464
Oh, you're still not eating?

463
00:44:10,283 --> 00:44:11,263
I don't wanna eat.

464
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:14,556
It's a waste.
I'll eat it for you.

465
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:15,636
Go ahead.

466
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:19,655
I'll eat while I watch the ocean.

467
00:44:20,107 --> 00:44:21,941
What's news?

468
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:26,233
Gas tank explosion kills three workers.

469
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:27,785
Oh my god.

470
00:44:27,972 --> 00:44:29,158
What time is it?

471
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:30,398
It's just after 7:00.

472
00:44:30,805 --> 00:44:31,605
after 7:00.

473
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:36,922
No other unusual news.

474
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,445
Small businesses are going out of business.

475
00:44:40,812 --> 00:44:41,812
Must be the recession.

476
00:44:42,737 --> 00:44:50,531
The president of Kiketsu Cosmetics is feared suicidal at his home

477
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:54,469
A CEO would be a fool to do such a thing.

478
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:04,327
Hello, Hotel New Ocean please.

479
00:45:05,742 --> 00:45:08,475
May I talk to Mr.Kigoshi?

480
00:45:13,269 --> 00:45:14,776
He's not there?

481
00:45:14,856 --> 00:45:16,402
Are you sure?

482
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,716
Is someone looking for him from Tokyo too?

483
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:26,610
Hello?
Hello?

484
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:34,757
I never heard from him again.

485
00:45:36,792 --> 00:45:40,112
He must have killed himself.

486
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:53,898
I should have stopped him at that time.

487
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:13,882
But even though we've only met twice.
My girlishness never goes away, and it makes me lonely every day.

488
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:34,690
And the jokes and pranks that didn't bother me before somehow started to leave a lump in my heart and I became a person who doesn't put in the work.

489
00:47:02,209 --> 00:47:03,329
Watch out!

490
00:47:04,793 --> 00:47:06,040
Thank you very much.

491
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,512
They say it's bad luck to have a cat cross the street in front of you.

492
00:47:09,829 --> 00:47:10,903
Watch out!

493
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,778
I'll help you.

494
00:47:18,166 --> 00:47:19,906
Have you ever heard of the Kumada massage?

495
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:21,746
It's our home.

496
00:47:23,579 --> 00:47:24,372
Oh.

497
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,067
You're going to study?

498
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,806
How do you even know that?

499
00:47:28,097 --> 00:47:30,064
You have calluses on your fingers.

500
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:35,040
Really?
I hear they are so hard.

501
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:36,713
Yes.

502
00:47:38,505 --> 00:47:40,218
I hope I don't embarrass myself.

503
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:43,555
Don't worry.
I'll talk to him.

504
00:47:50,939 --> 00:47:52,573
You're blind in one eye?

505
00:47:54,112 --> 00:47:56,145
You've been out of school for five years now?

506
00:47:56,632 --> 00:47:57,412
Yes.

507
00:47:58,019 --> 00:47:59,786
You've been working at many places.

508
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:03,772
Yes, I tried as many as I could, thinking of it as training.

509
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:07,664
Five years of experience is not enough for us.

510
00:48:07,937 --> 00:48:11,303
Please hire him.

511
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,729
I'm only worker here.
We need more hands.

512
00:48:15,432 --> 00:48:17,446
Please, I will study hard.

513
00:48:17,994 --> 00:48:21,260
I'm planning to attend the school's study group too.

514
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,307
Excuse me.

515
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,420
We came to say hello to you!

516
00:48:31,684 --> 00:48:34,471
His name is Kenkichi and he just joined our family.

517
00:48:34,974 --> 00:48:37,041
Please take care of him.

518
00:48:42,585 --> 00:48:49,758
I had a feeling that Kenkichi and I had a connection because of Kigoshi.

519
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:57,942
I was lonely, so Kigoshi must have sent him to me.

520
00:48:58,911 --> 00:49:07,973
When I think about it, I can't help but feel close to Kenkichi, even though I don't know him yet.

521
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:13,157
And then summer came.

522
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:24,335
Tsuruko.

523
00:49:25,808 --> 00:49:27,241
Oh Ito.

524
00:49:27,501 --> 00:49:28,608
How are you?

525
00:49:29,427 --> 00:49:32,600
What's going on?
It was hard, back then.

526
00:49:32,625 --> 00:49:34,020
But you settled the case, didn't you?

527
00:49:34,565 --> 00:49:37,432
I'm sure he'll pay for that.

528
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,853
I hear you and a man are working here only.

529
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:42,786
But how did you know about that?

530
00:49:42,958 --> 00:49:44,058
I heard it from someone.

531
00:49:44,855 --> 00:49:46,162
What are you doing?

532
00:49:46,395 --> 00:49:48,322
Same job.
I work at Yoshi-town.

533
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:50,997
Keep working.

534
00:49:51,892 --> 00:49:53,112
I beg you.

535
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,307
Give it to Teacher.

536
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:24,534
Did you wait?

537
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:26,084
An hour.

538
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,558
I had a free customer.

539
00:50:32,865 --> 00:50:34,212
Ken.

540
00:50:34,378 --> 00:50:34,918
What?

541
00:50:35,405 --> 00:50:36,652
Is there anyone around here?

542
00:50:38,398 --> 00:50:38,952
No.

543
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:42,365
Lead me.

544
00:50:47,448 --> 00:50:49,081
It's nice to be blind.

545
00:50:49,981 --> 00:50:50,741
Why?

546
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:56,413
I always see things in my mind's eye.
So I can remember everything clearly.

547
00:50:57,038 --> 00:50:58,218
What do you remember?

548
00:50:59,591 --> 00:51:01,671
I can't tell you. It's all in my mind.

549
00:51:02,105 --> 00:51:03,525
You're stingy.

550
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:11,334
Welcome.

551
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:19,154
Give us 2 soda.

552
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:24,494
I'll ask you something.

553
00:51:24,808 --> 00:51:25,561
What?

554
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:27,648
Do you see anyone?

555
00:51:28,741 --> 00:51:30,141
I don't.

556
00:51:30,324 --> 00:51:32,278
What is that?
Love letter?

557
00:51:32,388 --> 00:51:35,575
No.
This letter is from my ex-teacher.

558
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:38,456
Don't read my letter.

559
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,668
Don't worry.
I have to read for you.

560
00:51:40,742 --> 00:51:42,015
You can't.

561
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:53,732
This is awesome.

562
00:51:55,185 --> 00:52:03,906
I've thought about it a lot since then, but I'm still short 100,000 yen, so I have no choice but to turn to you.

563
00:52:05,026 --> 00:52:11,388
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow at 2:00 at our usual place.
Please lend me the money.

564
00:52:12,202 --> 00:52:15,302
I still can't get you out of my mind.

565
00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:20,036
I'm the happiest when you love me.

566
00:52:20,944 --> 00:52:23,997
Tomorrow, you can make love to me for the first time in a long time.

567
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:25,110
Itoko.

568
00:52:27,576 --> 00:52:30,069
This is good for you.

569
00:52:30,796 --> 00:52:32,376
Don't pick on me.

570
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:35,752
I'll throw this out later.

571
00:52:35,939 --> 00:52:36,792
Please.

572
00:52:38,935 --> 00:52:40,069
Don't tell my wife.

573
00:52:40,135 --> 00:52:41,289
I know.

574
00:52:54,049 --> 00:52:55,329
Buy some water melon.

575
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:56,696
Really?

576
00:52:57,196 --> 00:52:59,762
You're the kindest man I've ever met.

577
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:04,019
It's hot.

578
00:53:07,687 --> 00:53:09,441
Massage me.

579
00:53:10,097 --> 00:53:12,877
I have stiff shoulder.

580
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:18,749
Don't use him.
He'll go out with tsuruko soon.

581
00:53:19,052 --> 00:53:22,986
Why I have to use cold patch.

582
00:53:55,556 --> 00:53:56,462
What's wrong?

583
00:53:56,715 --> 00:53:59,235
I have a tummy ache.

584
00:53:59,267 --> 00:54:01,487
Oh my god.
What should I do.

585
00:54:02,081 --> 00:54:04,647
Are you alright?

586
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,013
Are you alright?

587
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:25,153
Do you think it's okay if you don't take pills?

588
00:54:26,302 --> 00:54:29,468
I'm fine.
The pain has stopped.

589
00:54:29,622 --> 00:54:31,282
That's good.

590
00:54:32,623 --> 00:54:33,723
Thank you very much.

591
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:36,071
Are you ready to go?

592
00:54:36,895 --> 00:54:38,588
I'll have to keep an eye on myself.

593
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:42,749
But how did you know about this place?

594
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:45,163
You've been here before, haven't you?

595
00:54:45,537 --> 00:54:46,590
No way.

596
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:49,202
I worked around here.

597
00:54:50,666 --> 00:54:52,072
Let's go home.

598
00:54:52,532 --> 00:54:53,739
Let's take it easy.

599
00:54:55,149 --> 00:54:56,575
It's so bright.

600
00:54:59,334 --> 00:55:02,274
What do you think of me?

601
00:55:02,907 --> 00:55:03,847
What?

602
00:55:03,953 --> 00:55:05,307
Do you like me or not?

603
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,015
Let's not talk about that.

604
00:55:08,129 --> 00:55:12,843
Tsuru-chan...
I liked you when I first met you.

605
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:14,835
I would do anything for you.

606
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:15,774
I'd die for you.

607
00:55:15,814 --> 00:55:17,147
Let's not do this.

608
00:55:17,362 --> 00:55:20,582
You don't hate me either.
You were happy to back out.

609
00:55:21,099 --> 00:55:24,232
Don't get me wrong.

610
00:55:24,257 --> 00:55:25,222
What do you mean?

611
00:55:25,247 --> 00:55:26,929
I'm leaving.

612
00:55:32,966 --> 00:55:33,953
Ken.

613
00:55:35,375 --> 00:55:37,835
You lied about having a stomach ache.

614
00:55:39,745 --> 00:55:42,271
You were just trying to get me in here.

615
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,561
Don't be so angry.

616
00:55:47,771 --> 00:55:48,898
What are you going to do with me?

617
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:50,286
I like you very much.

618
00:55:50,464 --> 00:55:51,617
Let me go!

619
00:55:53,494 --> 00:55:55,774
Ken,Let me go!

620
00:56:05,666 --> 00:56:06,892
Let me go!

621
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:20,979
No.

622
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,380
Let me go!

623
00:56:59,109 --> 00:57:02,096
This is not good idea.

624
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:04,911
I must not lose.

625
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:09,441
I resisted with all my heart.

626
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:33,245
But on the contrary, I gradually relaxed and felt a kind of comfort, but I couldn't do anything about it.

627
00:57:42,779 --> 00:57:44,786
Forgive me....  Kigoshi.

628
00:58:14,019 --> 00:58:19,032
I thought I was a woman with a little better hope.

629
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:23,871
I thought of myself as a woman with hope.

630
00:58:27,162 --> 00:58:35,725
But before I knew it, I had fallen into the trap of ordinary women.

631
00:58:38,545 --> 00:58:44,701
I tried to make my life worth living by indulging in Kenkichi's love.

632
00:58:47,264 --> 00:58:49,998
But then, women are weak.

633
00:58:52,405 --> 00:59:01,553
I loved him so much that I became obsessed with discovering the best parts of him.

634
00:59:05,481 --> 00:59:06,207
Don't move.

635
00:59:08,363 --> 00:59:10,184
I'll give you an extra copy later.

636
00:59:10,871 --> 00:59:12,871
I can't see the photo.

637
00:59:19,517 --> 00:59:23,533
I want to take lots of photos of you and put them up in my room.

638
00:59:24,486 --> 00:59:25,892
You're stupid.

639
00:59:29,228 --> 00:59:30,931
You're not going to school today?

640
00:59:31,611 --> 00:59:34,189
I'm not going.
I have to pay my monthly fee.

641
00:59:34,423 --> 00:59:36,845
Don't you have the money I gave you the other day?

642
00:59:37,798 --> 00:59:44,126
I used it.
You are busy but I have no income.

643
00:59:45,705 --> 00:59:47,509
You really go to school?

644
00:59:47,994 --> 00:59:49,580
You're not lying, are you?

645
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:51,298
I'm going.

646
00:59:56,216 --> 00:59:57,865
Don't waste your money

647
00:59:59,919 --> 01:00:00,826
Thanks.

648
01:00:01,872 --> 01:00:03,763
I heard that you save a lot of money.

649
01:00:04,404 --> 01:00:05,482
Who said that?

650
01:00:05,724 --> 01:00:09,029
It doesn't matter who said it.
200,000, 300,000?

651
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:10,404
I can't tell.

652
01:00:12,083 --> 01:00:14,404
Mr. Kimura call you.

653
01:00:14,638 --> 01:00:16,576
Go, Tsuru-chan.

654
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:19,490
I have a cold.
I'll leave it to Ken.

655
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:21,169
But he's not good enough.

656
01:00:21,194 --> 01:00:24,818
He likes it strong, so ken is better.

657
01:00:25,115 --> 01:00:28,115
Take care of him.

658
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,833
Leave it to me.

659
01:00:32,814 --> 01:00:35,861
I have to go away for four or five days.

660
01:00:36,072 --> 01:00:37,158
Oh, where are you going?

661
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:39,939
My sister has had a stroke.

662
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,025
I might be a little late.

663
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:46,743
Take care of my husband.

664
01:01:30,142 --> 01:01:31,306
What are you doing?

665
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:34,634
Kenkichi.
Try it on.

666
01:01:35,181 --> 01:01:36,353
My kimono?

667
01:01:36,423 --> 01:01:39,111
I worked all night to surprise you.

668
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:40,790
Try it on.

669
01:01:45,531 --> 01:01:47,524
It's perfect.

670
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:49,656
I'm sure it'll look good on you.

671
01:01:49,781 --> 01:01:50,804
This is nice pattern.

672
01:01:50,852 --> 01:01:53,031
The shop staff helped me find a good color.

673
01:01:54,055 --> 01:01:55,414
Thank you.

674
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:58,078
Someone might come.

675
01:01:59,436 --> 01:02:01,952
Come here,Kenkichi.

676
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:15,122
I met Mr. Sakai from Omori at a union meeting.

677
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:18,262
He said you were there until this spring.

678
01:02:21,637 --> 01:02:25,887
Then there's nothing more to say.
Pack up your things and come out.

679
01:02:26,934 --> 01:02:27,778
Master.

680
01:02:27,934 --> 01:02:31,434
I will not hire someone who will assault your master.

681
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:34,317
Don't get me wrong.
Because he hit me.

682
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:36,497
You have so many excuses.
Get out.

683
01:02:39,044 --> 01:02:43,988
Are you sure you fire me?
I don't think it's good for you.

684
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,317
What are you talking about?

685
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,536
Don't pretend you don't know.

686
01:02:47,387 --> 01:02:48,364
About Itoko.

687
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:50,528
I know about that.

688
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:56,942
Are you threatening me?
Get the hell out of here.

689
01:02:57,262 --> 01:03:00,223
I'm very angry with you.

690
01:03:00,248 --> 01:03:03,325
You have a bad attitude.
Please apologize to him.

691
01:03:03,512 --> 01:03:05,192
I'm leaving.

692
01:03:05,403 --> 01:03:06,528
Ken.

693
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:12,380
I'll apologize so please don't fire him.

694
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:17,708
He have no where to go.
He might do something bad.

695
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:22,270
Do you have anything to do with him?

696
01:03:22,497 --> 01:03:26,692
If that's the case, be careful.
He's a dead end.

697
01:03:27,442 --> 01:03:30,278
I'll take care of us myself.

698
01:03:30,575 --> 01:03:35,630
So please don't kick him out.
If the union finds out, he won't be able to work in Tokyo.

699
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:44,395
I'll work for both of us.
I'll start paying for his food tomorrow.

700
01:03:44,606 --> 01:03:47,223
Tsuruko...

701
01:03:53,881 --> 01:03:54,733
Ken.

702
01:03:59,529 --> 01:04:00,264
Ken.

703
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:01,490
Ken.

704
01:04:05,536 --> 01:04:06,606
Ken.

705
01:04:11,668 --> 01:04:13,161
Stay here.

706
01:04:13,301 --> 01:04:17,825
I don't wanna leave.
He didn't ask me why.

707
01:04:18,832 --> 01:04:25,575
He's strict, but he's also very kind-hearted.

708
01:04:26,286 --> 01:04:31,028
And for my sake, Please be Patience.

709
01:04:31,879 --> 01:04:34,200
Please

710
01:04:35,168 --> 01:04:36,832
OK.

711
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:57,022
Kenkichi, who had been irritable for a while since then, finally calmed down.

712
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:02,873
Peaceful happiness has come to last between us.

713
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:14,319
This may be thanks to Mr. Kigoshi.
I secretly think in a corner of my mind

714
01:05:22,303 --> 01:05:23,858
I'm home.

715
01:05:28,311 --> 01:05:29,748
What's the matter?

716
01:05:29,943 --> 01:05:31,717
Itoko is here.

717
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:33,647
She's brazen.

718
01:05:33,990 --> 01:05:35,037
She'll stay here.

719
01:05:35,733 --> 01:05:37,811
I'll kick her out.

720
01:05:37,836 --> 01:05:40,826
Master called her.

721
01:06:31,032 --> 01:06:33,016
Stop it.

722
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:36,423
Please, don't do this.

723
01:06:37,446 --> 01:06:38,907
Please, don't do this.

724
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:40,928
We can't.

725
01:06:41,217 --> 01:06:41,920
Don't worry.

726
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:43,678
You sure?

727
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,717
Someone is there.

728
01:06:48,225 --> 01:06:49,451
I'm sure our mother's back.

729
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:50,397
Don't scare me.

730
01:06:50,725 --> 01:06:51,694
Go to check it.

731
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:53,397
What should I do if she comes back?

732
01:06:53,654 --> 01:06:57,561
We shouldn't do this.

733
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,423
Are you still awake?

734
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:12,063
I heard a noise in the kitchen. I thought someone was coming.

735
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,173
No one would come now.

736
01:07:15,524 --> 01:07:18,360
But your wife might be home.

737
01:07:27,865 --> 01:07:30,459
Did you hear?

738
01:07:44,988 --> 01:07:47,339
She must be mom.

739
01:07:51,674 --> 01:07:52,400
Who?

740
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,846
Post office.

741
01:08:00,463 --> 01:08:01,892
Thank you.

742
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,508
You have received a telegram.

743
01:08:13,758 --> 01:08:14,594
I'll open the door.

744
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:17,039
Don't open.
Read it.

745
01:08:22,138 --> 01:08:25,974
9:15 p.m. Sister dead.

746
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,091
She's dead?
I'll get a telegram in the morning, so get some sleep.

747
01:08:32,115 --> 01:08:33,138
Good night.

748
01:08:54,051 --> 01:08:56,504
They are having fun.

749
01:08:56,895 --> 01:08:59,981
We should go to bed now.

750
01:09:00,809 --> 01:09:03,160
I can't hold back.

751
01:09:11,578 --> 01:09:13,953
I'm worried about someone finding out.

752
01:09:41,145 --> 01:09:43,981
I have two more stores to go, so I'll be home late.

753
01:09:44,379 --> 01:09:45,598
get a cab.

754
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:46,629
I know.

755
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,082
Take care.

756
01:10:09,336 --> 01:10:11,227
Hello, this is Kumada Massage.

757
01:10:11,889 --> 01:10:16,129
thank you for your continued patronage
Yes, I'll be right.

758
01:10:20,223 --> 01:10:23,390
I can't have you sneaking around our house like a cat burglar.

759
01:10:24,340 --> 01:10:25,680
I wish you'd get out of here.

760
01:10:25,705 --> 01:10:30,087
I'm not a cat burglar.
You're in love with Kenichi, too.

761
01:10:30,683 --> 01:10:33,603
We're going to get married when I work a little more.

762
01:10:33,929 --> 01:10:34,795
I'm not like you.

763
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:38,759
Don't tell your mother about me.

764
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,496
I'll pay you back.

765
01:10:40,729 --> 01:10:43,709
Don't make fun of me just because I'm blind.

766
01:10:56,754 --> 01:10:57,660
I sent her off.

767
01:10:57,794 --> 01:11:01,380
I'm going to see Mr. Yabe.
If there's a call, take it.

768
01:11:20,732 --> 01:11:22,218
I left the alcohol.

769
01:11:36,506 --> 01:11:41,993
You're bad.
You just got little money from her.

770
01:11:43,610 --> 01:11:47,116
But She's clever.

771
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:50,374
She doesn't pay if I say I go to school.

772
01:11:50,786 --> 01:11:52,999
I don't like such a smart woman.

773
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:54,406
Because you love her.

774
01:11:56,216 --> 01:11:57,523
No way.

775
01:11:58,744 --> 01:12:01,557
I'm jealous of you and master.

776
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,730
Don't get jealous.

777
01:12:05,556 --> 01:12:07,809
I'll get money as I plan.

778
01:12:08,411 --> 01:12:09,264
I'm counting on you.

779
01:12:11,063 --> 01:12:12,329
Hug me.

780
01:12:18,832 --> 01:12:20,199
Oh you are here.

781
01:12:27,627 --> 01:12:28,554
What's the hell?

782
01:12:29,841 --> 01:12:31,734
Don't hit him.

783
01:12:34,015 --> 01:12:37,055
I tell you. We have been dating.

784
01:12:37,905 --> 01:12:42,452
You said I was burglar cat, but you took my man, too.

785
01:12:44,097 --> 01:12:46,303
Don't get upset.

786
01:12:46,950 --> 01:12:49,270
Let's talk democratically, the three of us.

787
01:12:49,796 --> 01:12:51,449
How much will you give me?

788
01:12:52,215 --> 01:12:56,588
I loaned you my man for a few months.
I won't part with him for free.

789
01:12:57,587 --> 01:12:58,727
How much will you give me?

790
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:02,420
We'll talk before master come back.

791
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,621
Don't touch me.

792
01:14:14,833 --> 01:14:15,893
What's wrong?

793
01:14:16,541 --> 01:14:17,688
Are you sick?

794
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:21,218
Kigoshi.

795
01:14:24,231 --> 01:14:25,391
Tsuru.

796
01:14:26,912 --> 01:14:28,139
Hello again.

797
01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:32,038
You're alive.

798
01:14:34,634 --> 01:14:36,141
I'm fine.

799
01:14:43,643 --> 01:14:44,723
One beer.

800
01:14:45,869 --> 01:14:47,143
Welcome.

801
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:54,631
Give me a towel.

802
01:14:59,878 --> 01:15:01,192
Come in.

803
01:15:03,469 --> 01:15:05,022
Here's a towel.

804
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:07,148
You get wet.

805
01:15:33,138 --> 01:15:36,178
Sorry I didn't call you.

806
01:15:36,897 --> 01:15:37,877
Don't worry.

807
01:15:38,801 --> 01:15:43,021
I had to disappear when my creditors came to the hotel.

808
01:15:44,259 --> 01:15:45,519
I thought you die.

809
01:15:51,739 --> 01:15:55,046
I promised you I wouldn't kill myself.

810
01:16:00,284 --> 01:16:06,400
I've been running around amongst my friends ever since and I'm trying to get back on track.

811
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:08,340
Order?

812
01:16:08,801 --> 01:16:12,181
Sake and foods.

813
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:21,246
You haven't changed at all.

814
01:16:23,400 --> 01:16:26,400
You haven't changed at all too.

815
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:31,594
I even stayed in a love hotel.

816
01:16:37,611 --> 01:16:42,511
I thought about you sometimes when it was raining.

817
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:46,823
I wonder how you're doing
I wonder if you are happy.

818
01:16:47,691 --> 01:16:51,184
I wonder if you're still using your intuition.

819
01:16:53,123 --> 01:16:56,563
Thinking about you has been a strange relief from the loneliness.

820
01:17:00,701 --> 01:17:01,788
Are you still at that house?

821
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:05,917
It's hard to work when it's cold again, isn't it?

822
01:17:12,477 --> 01:17:15,857
What's the matter?
Your beautiful eyes are sweating profusely.

823
01:17:17,572 --> 01:17:21,552
Don't be mad at me.
I have a favor to ask you.

824
01:17:23,558 --> 01:17:24,098
Say it.

825
01:17:26,064 --> 01:17:30,350
Will you use my savings?
It's only a little.

826
01:17:31,001 --> 01:17:32,087
What are you talking about?

827
01:17:32,509 --> 01:17:35,769
It's only 300,000 yen.
Please...

828
01:17:36,867 --> 01:17:41,441
Don't talk nonsense.
I'm a man for nothing now.

829
01:17:42,201 --> 01:17:44,421
I don't think you have to invest me.

830
01:17:44,486 --> 01:17:45,519
I don't care.

831
01:17:46,707 --> 01:17:49,593
I don't need it for my own convenience.

832
01:17:51,006 --> 01:17:54,192
If I can be of any help, I'll be happy.

833
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:09,294
Are you watching my face?

834
01:18:10,311 --> 01:18:11,477
Keep an eye on it.

835
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,708
So you remember me sometimes.

836
01:18:17,204 --> 01:18:20,651
What are you thinking?

837
01:18:21,757 --> 01:18:22,377
Say it.

838
01:18:24,285 --> 01:18:26,078
I think nothing.

839
01:18:28,481 --> 01:18:29,554
But.

840
01:18:31,027 --> 01:18:31,614
But?

841
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:38,741
It's just... it's sad not seeing your face.

842
01:19:03,692 --> 01:19:04,899
Are you mad?

843
01:19:06,338 --> 01:19:07,665
No.

844
01:19:08,351 --> 01:19:09,758
Here it is.

845
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:12,431
Thanks.

846
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:19,152
I'll have it.

847
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:20,529
You can't drink.

848
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:21,696
I wanna drink.

849
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:38,365
It's delicious.

850
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,000
Would you like to go to the countryside with me?

851
01:19:48,336 --> 01:19:51,756
And now you're going to need me to be your confidant.

852
01:19:54,892 --> 01:19:58,559
I don't know what's going on, but I know you've made up your mind.

853
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:03,440
But let's leave all that behind, and let's just be born again and live together.

854
01:20:04,754 --> 01:20:07,534
We don't have to be rich.

855
01:20:08,692 --> 01:20:12,586
If our hearts and minds are perfectly in tune with each other, there is no happiness above that.

856
01:20:16,563 --> 01:20:18,189
Let's go to the country, just the two of us.

857
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:23,294
I'm not who I used to be.

858
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,768
I made a stupid mistake.

859
01:20:25,799 --> 01:20:27,429
It doesn't matter.

860
01:20:27,709 --> 01:20:29,923
I'll take you away.

861
01:20:32,826 --> 01:20:34,872
I don't need anything but you.

862
01:20:36,046 --> 01:20:37,966
I'd be happy in any corner of the country.

863
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:46,265
Okay?
You promise?

864
01:20:49,826 --> 01:20:53,646
You're taking pity on me, aren't you?

865
01:20:54,999 --> 01:20:56,398
Because I'm blind.

866
01:20:57,045 --> 01:20:58,331
No.

867
01:20:59,326 --> 01:21:03,366
I love you.
Ever since we first met.

868
01:21:05,289 --> 01:21:10,616
But don't be so cavalier about a man making a commitment based on a passing fancy.

869
01:21:10,641 --> 01:21:13,037
I've made up my mind.

870
01:21:13,162 --> 01:21:17,615
Then why don't you make up your mind to start working again?

871
01:21:18,638 --> 01:21:21,771
I thought you were that kind of man.

872
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:27,552
I beg you.

873
01:21:27,951 --> 01:21:30,935
Please use my savings to support your business.

874
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:39,236
Why don't you tell me?

875
01:21:44,244 --> 01:21:45,650
Is it because I'm massagist?

876
01:21:51,431 --> 01:21:55,619
Is that so?
You don't want my money?

877
01:21:58,248 --> 01:22:00,959
Thank you.

878
01:22:03,030 --> 01:22:05,092
You're going to use it?

879
01:22:07,717 --> 01:22:11,123
I won't let your feelings go to waste.

880
01:22:12,592 --> 01:22:13,319
I'm glad.

881
01:22:15,569 --> 01:22:18,037
I'll return this to you.

882
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:20,530
Wait for me.

883
01:22:20,959 --> 01:22:23,467
I'll be right back with my savings book.

884
01:22:25,365 --> 01:22:27,889
I have one more favor to ask.

885
01:22:29,053 --> 01:22:29,905
What?

886
01:22:32,373 --> 01:22:35,389
I don't know your face yet.

887
01:22:36,772 --> 01:22:40,537
Let me touch you just once.

888
01:23:01,272 --> 01:23:03,842
I knew it.

889
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,733
I knew it.

890
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:35,690
Kenkichi and Itoko steel money from the safe and ran away.

891
01:23:57,817 --> 01:23:59,395
I'm relieved.

892
01:24:29,395 --> 01:24:31,544
We're closed

893
01:24:31,989 --> 01:24:34,496
The customer who just went to the back of the room is where?

894
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:36,598
He left.

895
01:24:37,067 --> 01:24:38,263
He left?

896
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:42,098
He said I appreciate that,
But I'll do it myself.

897
01:25:35,111 --> 01:25:36,540
This was all right.

898
01:25:37,665 --> 01:25:39,189
This was all right.

899
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:42,509
I told myself that this was the right thing to do.

900
01:25:44,267 --> 01:25:55,508
I had no choice but to do this in order to keep his love unclouded and in my heart for the rest of my life.

901
01:25:58,267 --> 01:26:02,243
I am sure he will recover.

902
01:26:03,756 --> 01:26:07,803
And one day he will call me again.

903
01:26:09,561 --> 01:26:11,576
As a customer and massagist.

904
01:26:14,928 --> 01:26:19,373
I somehow got out of all sorts of trouble.

905
01:26:20,100 --> 01:26:24,100
I seem to have gained a sense of security as a blind person.

906
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:35,852
I can now live as a massagist for the rest of my life.

907
01:27:51,701 --> 01:28:00,817
THE END

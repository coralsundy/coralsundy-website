00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,216
Dear voters

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,154
Please vote for Ochiai MASAHIDE in the upcoming mayoral election!

4
00:00:21,505 --> 00:00:29,896
He is a new politician who will solve political problems at the root and build a healthy society.

5
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:33,840
Please vote for Ochiai MASAHIDE

6
00:00:34,185 --> 00:00:37,787
He's the new politician.

7
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:39,685
Hey, let's take turns

8
00:00:41,349 --> 00:00:45,615
We are tried to work on this

9
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:51,927
Five times a minute, three hundred times an hour. From six in the morning until, let's see, nine at night.

10
00:00:51,952 --> 00:00:52,552
4500 times

11
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:53,591
It's ridiculous.

12
00:00:53,623 --> 00:00:54,958
It's not ridiculous.

13
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:55,662
Why?

14
00:00:55,911 --> 00:01:02,067
If Mr. Ochiai is elected, this town will be a better place to live, and our gas and electricity bills will be lower.

15
00:01:02,482 --> 00:01:03,974
You like him?

16
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:10,138
He's a professor, an M.D., austere, deluxe suit.

17
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,669
I love him.

18
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,505
That's why I don't want women to vote.

19
00:01:14,662 --> 00:01:18,537
Japanese politics is not much different when it comes to innovative parties.

20
00:01:19,059 --> 00:01:25,427
In fact, the gas and electricity bills would be higher with an innovative party.
Reforms and progress are not done in this country. They don't do reform or progress in this country, do they?

21
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:28,865
It's because of men like you, who are just as bad as you are.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,966
Hey, let's take turns

23
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:40,807
Let's free this town from dirty politics!

24
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:46,979
Please vote for Ochiai MASAHIDE

25
00:01:47,636 --> 00:01:52,034
Please vote for Ochiai MASAHIDE

26
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:59,011
It's so hot, I don't know why the heating in the lodge is so strong.

27
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,915
I can't wait to hear what you have to say about it.

28
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,759
I will

29
00:02:06,642 --> 00:02:12,931
But it's very scary.
I'm sober... and I need to get drunk.

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,351
Well, you'll have to drink more to keep me company.

31
00:02:20,132 --> 00:02:23,554
Let's drink together

32
00:02:40,881 --> 00:02:43,256
Hey, is anyone home?

33
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:56,586
Welcome.

34
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,875
It's bad nobody here

35
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,727
I'm sorry.
I was bored

36
00:03:02,977 --> 00:03:04,203
How many guests do you have?

37
00:03:04,578 --> 00:03:06,469
That's only two couples.

38
00:03:06,992 --> 00:03:08,071
What's going on?

39
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:11,032
Eloping.
There's a fear of suicide.

40
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,602
A company president of about 40 and a female office worker of about 20.

41
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:18,109
Well...
We have those guests?

42
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:20,242
Both couples are young.

43
00:03:20,649 --> 00:03:22,711
What a nuisance.

44
00:03:22,789 --> 00:03:24,141
It's our shift time.

45
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:26,985
I'm sure you'd like to go home and have a drink.

46
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,149
I'm getting a lump in my throat.

47
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,672
One such guest, not staying overnight but on a break
They are upstairs in room 12.

48
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,242
I'd like to meet with them just in case

49
00:03:41,571 --> 00:03:44,055
By the way, How about the election?

50
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,930
I don't care one way or the other.

51
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:52,219
When the new mayor takes over, this hotel will be shut down.

52
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:57,054
This town has been under the Conservative Party's thumb for the last ten years.
I'm tired of it.

53
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,297
We have to change

54
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:04,047
Do you want me to bring a beer for you?

55
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,610
No way

56
00:04:06,852 --> 00:04:08,110
She has not come yet

57
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,889
Can I have a light?

58
00:04:30,417 --> 00:04:31,261
Thanks

59
00:04:40,852 --> 00:04:41,883
They are dead

60
00:04:41,908 --> 00:04:42,758
What?

61
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,781
No matter how many times I knocked, there was no answer. I thought it was weird, so I opened the door.

62
00:04:51,047 --> 00:04:52,578
He chocked her

63
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,795
She's stripper Akiko

64
00:05:07,837 --> 00:05:09,688
I've seen this guy before.

65
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,063
It's OCHIAI.
OCHIAI, candidate for mayor.

66
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:22,589
A murder has been reported at the Washington Hotel.

67
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:23,214
A murder?

68
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:35,285
Yami o Yokogire / Across Darkness (1959)

69
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,899
There's been a murder.

70
00:05:30,695 --> 00:05:36,867
22:55 at the Washington Hotel.
There's been a murder.

71
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:42,453
Victim was strangled to death.
Suspect is Ochiai MASAHIDE

72
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,772
22:55 at the Washington Hotel.
There's been a murder.

73
00:06:13,654 --> 00:06:19,255
Victim was strangled to death.
Suspect is Ochiai MASAHIDE

74
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:24,068
The investigation headquarters is at the marginal police station.

75
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:27,811
I have no idea

76
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:30,818
We were during sex

77
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:36,791
Again

78
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:41,853
There's been a murder.

79
00:06:42,549 --> 00:06:49,002
22:55 at the Washington Hotel.
There's been a murder.

80
00:06:49,705 --> 00:06:55,150
Victim was strangled to death.
Suspect is Ochiai MASAHIDE

81
00:07:07,606 --> 00:07:09,856
You are just playboy

82
00:07:10,903 --> 00:07:13,020
You are bad!

83
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,710
You killed Akiko

84
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:33,211
You killed my wife

85
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:39,056
What the hell?

86
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:43,446
I won't forgive you

87
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:45,696
What the hell?

88
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:50,969
You played my wife

89
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:55,285
I won't forgive you

90
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,621
Damn it

91
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:18,552
Oh Ishizuka?

92
00:08:19,544 --> 00:08:20,325
Thanks

93
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:22,536
I heard you found the crime scene.

94
00:08:22,561 --> 00:08:23,638
Yeah

95
00:08:24,544 --> 00:08:25,271
Who's suspect?

96
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:33,310
I don't want to live long.
A mayoral candidate committed murder.

97
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:38,544
The victim is Akiko, a popular stripper
It's a nasty world we live in.

98
00:08:39,794 --> 00:08:41,403
I can't even think about it.

99
00:08:41,802 --> 00:08:45,091
But the room was locked from the inside.

100
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,208
There are plenty of duplicate keys in that little hotel.

101
00:08:49,669 --> 00:08:53,607
I'll leave those difficult cases to the brass at the precinct.

102
00:08:54,185 --> 00:08:55,560
Did the hotel guests check it out?

103
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:59,792
There were two other couples there.
They're all having a good time, a

104
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:01,980
There are no weird hotel servants.

105
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:02,862
No

106
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:06,409
I'm too busy to write the report

107
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:12,212
My hands are shaking. I can't write very well.

108
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:14,447
You drink too much.

109
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:16,259
I don't have anything else to do.

110
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:21,376
You've been an officer for 30 years. You'll know how I feel.

111
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,212
Give me a light, please.

112
00:09:24,845 --> 00:09:25,439
Light?

113
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:37,915
There's one

114
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:38,962
What's wrong?

115
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:40,884
I'm sure there was one

116
00:09:41,064 --> 00:09:42,157
Who?

117
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:44,282
One of the weirdos asked me to light his cigarette.

118
00:09:46,332 --> 00:09:48,989
I don't want to get old. It's easy to forget

119
00:09:51,036 --> 00:09:52,442
Can I talk to Ikuta chief?

120
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:59,909
I will get bonus soon
I'm in a daze.

121
00:10:00,448 --> 00:10:02,096
I doubt you'll make it till then.

122
00:10:02,229 --> 00:10:07,752
I'm ok. because Ikuta is with me
What's the first thing I'm going to buy when I get my bonus?

123
00:10:08,026 --> 00:10:08,698
A fishing rod?

124
00:10:09,197 --> 00:10:10,002
A TV.

125
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:12,862
My wife's probably sick in bed.

126
00:10:13,815 --> 00:10:16,620
Ikuta chief?
I'm Katayama.

127
00:10:17,268 --> 00:10:20,206
I forgot to mention something important.

128
00:10:20,448 --> 00:10:23,135
What? The guy with the scars on his face?

129
00:10:23,713 --> 00:10:26,471
Brown Jacket?
Why you didn't tell me earlier?

130
00:10:26,721 --> 00:10:28,651
Were you being drunker?

131
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,557
OK I get it

132
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,035
Why did you meet Akiko?

133
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:47,381
Because she was going to provide me with information that would benefit the election.

134
00:10:47,552 --> 00:10:48,904
 information that would benefit the election?

135
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:55,565
Why did you go the hotel?

136
00:10:56,964 --> 00:11:00,979
She said it would be less conspicuous.
She says she'll be killed if she's found.

137
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,011
I see.

138
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,542
Did you get that information?

139
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,550
Before I could ask her, someone hit me out of the blue and I passed out.

140
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:10,589
someone?

141
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,714
Maybe you got drunk and fell and hit your head somewhere.

142
00:11:16,042 --> 00:11:16,979
Give me a break

143
00:11:18,417 --> 00:11:20,729
So you don't remember strangling her?

144
00:11:21,769 --> 00:11:22,222
No

145
00:11:23,534 --> 00:11:26,909
What about this face and hand worm reveal?

146
00:11:29,144 --> 00:11:33,073
We found a piece of your skin under her fingernail.

147
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:40,142
By the way, you have a tendency to drink heavily.

148
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:41,907
I have a tendency to drink heavily?

149
00:11:42,704 --> 00:11:47,415
When you were a student and then an assistant professor, you got into a drunken brawl.

150
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,251
That was a long time ago.

151
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,853
When you sobered up, you told the officer you didn't remember anything.

152
00:11:55,501 --> 00:11:56,095
Yes

153
00:11:57,506 --> 00:11:58,459
so same again?

154
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,256
I just had two whiskeys.

155
00:12:03,373 --> 00:12:07,092
You had a lot of alcohol in your blood.

156
00:12:08,795 --> 00:12:13,678
It's a trap to get me voted out of office, too.
I don't know if you can understand that.

157
00:12:13,703 --> 00:12:17,662
Don't get excited.
You're going to cool off in jail.

158
00:12:17,967 --> 00:12:20,959
I'm innocent.

159
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:25,779
One more week and it's time to vote.
Until then, I will plead my innocence to the people of this town.

160
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:28,139
Don't do that

161
00:12:29,045 --> 00:12:32,537
This is a fishing town, and it's always been known for its rowdiness.

162
00:12:33,631 --> 00:12:35,264
You'll be safer here.

163
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:39,951
You're working with the mayor now, aren't you?
Help me

164
00:12:41,053 --> 00:12:43,178
get hands off of me

165
00:12:45,896 --> 00:12:48,428
Like this election is over.

166
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:51,576
He's a fool.
I can't believe he'd put his hands on a woman.

167
00:12:51,693 --> 00:12:53,209
I wanna seduce you

168
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:55,692
I'm honored.
Wanna play with me?

169
00:12:55,717 --> 00:12:56,654
Really?

170
00:12:58,623 --> 00:13:05,896
I don't know if he was born in this town, but I hate the idea of him coming out of Tokyo to be mayor.

171
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:10,646
We, the Conservative Party, are the ones who rebuilt this town from the war to what it is today.

172
00:13:11,318 --> 00:13:17,771
We can't let a socialist like Ochiai take over this town of righteousness and humanity.

173
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,982
Well, take your time.

174
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,584
I have to go for greeting

175
00:13:26,303 --> 00:13:29,646
I'm disappointed with him

176
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,490
He's a long shot, but he'll get what he wants.

177
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:38,826
He's got the support of Mr. Hirose, who says he can't sleep with his feet on the street.

178
00:13:42,209 --> 00:13:46,131
Sorry I didn't notice you

179
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,170
He and Mr. Okada, Bureau Chief of Toa Japan, are a rare combination.

180
00:13:51,592 --> 00:13:52,248
What are you talking about?

181
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:55,029
Mr. Mayor, I'd like you to hear this.

182
00:13:55,623 --> 00:14:01,826
Actually, between you and me.
My headquarters is planning a major expansion into this region.

183
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:04,740
So We need Mr.Hirose's support

184
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:12,177
Only people who have always liked him and his fights and expositions more are here.

185
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,755
and women

186
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,537
And they've been called component newspapers for a long time, but they're newspapers with a firm foothold in the market.

187
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,850
There's no room for your newspaper.

188
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,193
Good evening.
What's going on news paper?

189
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:34,139
I got it

190
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:39,365
Is this the creation of Mr. Hirose, the Toto Nippo and
Mr. Hirose, the Toto Nippo and Mr. Hirose are teaming up to crush the Seibu Shimbun?

191
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:43,725
That's a good idea

192
00:14:44,264 --> 00:14:46,592
Without that kind of excitement, there's no point in making a newspaper.

193
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:51,748
Can't you ever go back?

194
00:14:55,232 --> 00:14:59,131
Is it really appropriate for the editor-in-chief to be wandering around here now?

195
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,115
I'm here to hear your opinion.

196
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:07,029
You can't stop laughing, can you?
Mr. Ochiai candidate just fell off his horse.

197
00:15:07,256 --> 00:15:07,982
No way

198
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,662
Your face is telling so

199
00:15:12,865 --> 00:15:13,865
Right,Hirose?

200
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:15,889
It could be

201
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:20,709
It's a bad taste in the mouth to have my henchmen bad-mouthing you.

202
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:21,365
Excuse me

203
00:15:22,131 --> 00:15:24,725
At best, you can come up with a shocking tactic.

204
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:31,302
He's a nasty man

205
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:40,341
But he's a great guy.
He was bought from Tokyo by the editor-in-chief of the Seibu Shimbun, and in three years, he turned the Seibu into a top newspaper in western Japan.

206
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:42,466
He's too good for the SEIBU

207
00:15:42,654 --> 00:15:43,537
It could be

208
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,978
How's your baby?

209
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,494
He's 1 month 3 days

210
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,701
Do you have the site schematics ready?

211
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:31,475
Soon

212
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:34,318
What are the police saying?

213
00:16:34,522 --> 00:16:38,318
Common crime of passion, lover's quarrel.

214
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:42,100
Did you check out Akiko's background?

215
00:16:42,357 --> 00:16:49,521
She was born a poor fisherman's daughter, a juvenile delinquent, then a jazz singer, and finally a stripper.

216
00:16:50,428 --> 00:16:51,459
A woman's life?

217
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,420
We've got some great photos, Mr. Director.

218
00:16:56,678 --> 00:16:58,740
You have one hour left until the deadline, so hang in there.

219
00:17:00,014 --> 00:17:06,154
And don't write anything that's a bluff or a lie.

220
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:11,686
I know, I know.
I know, I know. Ishizuka's got some interesting stuff.

221
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,230
Tell me

222
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:22,051
The stripper case... that could be reversed.

223
00:17:22,293 --> 00:17:22,910
What?

224
00:17:23,105 --> 00:17:28,027
Officer Katayama saw a strange man just before he found the case.
A man with scars.

225
00:17:28,402 --> 00:17:34,254
If he's the culprit...
I think it's a trap to crush Ochiai.

226
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:38,035
A trap... I see...

227
00:17:38,629 --> 00:17:40,488
I think you're doing a little too well.

228
00:17:40,941 --> 00:17:42,590
I'm confident.

229
00:17:43,246 --> 00:17:44,621
You sure?

230
00:17:45,316 --> 00:17:49,387
I've been chasing that scarred guy

231
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:52,496
I can't stop you

232
00:17:52,848 --> 00:17:53,559
Yeah

233
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:58,457
Okay, go ahead.
But be careful. If there's a politician involved, it's too noisy.

234
00:17:58,926 --> 00:17:59,566
I'm fine.

235
00:18:00,082 --> 00:18:00,738
Wait

236
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:07,905
You should be tidy up

237
00:18:10,835 --> 00:18:13,679
But you remind me of my younger self.

238
00:18:14,202 --> 00:18:17,991
When it comes to news, I change the color of my eyes and run like a hound

239
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,317
You're my goal

240
00:18:26,262 --> 00:18:28,731
You are bit of a prick

241
00:18:28,778 --> 00:18:29,661
but it's true.

242
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:32,723
I've been trying to emulate you ever since I joined the company

243
00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:34,515
Can you?

244
00:18:35,265 --> 00:18:36,335
Yes

245
00:18:36,655 --> 00:18:37,624
You sure?

246
00:18:38,296 --> 00:18:41,772
You'll see.
I'll become your second generation.

247
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:47,839
But don't be a drunk like me.

248
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,130
Other companies are saying dumb things.

249
00:19:02,771 --> 00:19:03,794
Stop there

250
00:19:23,414 --> 00:19:24,719
Chief

251
00:19:25,469 --> 00:19:28,625
The man Katayama-san saw.
Did you find out his identity?

252
00:19:28,836 --> 00:19:29,352
What's that?

253
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:30,711
The man with the scars.

254
00:19:31,688 --> 00:19:32,727
I don't know.

255
00:19:34,662 --> 00:19:40,099
I was there when Katayama-san called you last night.

256
00:19:41,326 --> 00:19:42,232
That call?

257
00:19:43,857 --> 00:19:44,841
Tell me

258
00:19:45,966 --> 00:19:50,162
Katayama called again, apologizing that he'd misjudged

259
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:52,748
he'd misjudged?

260
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,419
I got angry with him

261
00:19:55,826 --> 00:19:59,498
He's an alcoholic, a nice guy, his only problem is his drinking.

262
00:19:59,523 --> 00:20:00,005
But

263
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:01,333
 I'm a busy man.

264
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:09,068
I've had five car accidents since this morning, and I haven't had time for a cup of tea.

265
00:20:09,093 --> 00:20:10,686
The road is too narrow

266
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:11,889
You can't drive

267
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,248
The car is bad

268
00:20:13,397 --> 00:20:14,983
You should complain to the mayor.

269
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:22,951
He's always appealing to the mayor to expand the city's roads.
But as soon as he's elected, there's no budget, so the project's canceled.

270
00:20:28,075 --> 00:20:28,919
What's wrong?

271
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,895
Katayama officer is in?

272
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:31,848
He's on holiday

273
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,083
He's on holiday?

274
00:20:38,198 --> 00:20:41,589
Why do you think my body aches when I get old?

275
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:45,948
Because you push yourself too hard when you were young.
You eat poorly and work too hard.

276
00:20:46,761 --> 00:20:52,776
When a Japanese woman turns fifty.
80% of them suffer from neuralgia.

277
00:20:53,315 --> 00:20:55,597
I'm a reporter for the Seibu newspaper.
Where is your husband...?

278
00:20:56,479 --> 00:20:58,347
He's on holiday

279
00:20:58,503 --> 00:20:59,706
He's on holiday? Where?

280
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:06,425
I can't believe he's just going to wander around wherever he likes. He left Early this morning.

281
00:21:06,534 --> 00:21:07,651
Shouldn't he tell you

282
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:08,565
no

283
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:14,331
I've been working on a new project.

284
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:21,573
We've started to feature people who work for the city in a quiet and inconspicuous way.

285
00:21:22,268 --> 00:21:26,448
Katayama-san was chosen to be the first one.
I came to you for photos and materials.

286
00:21:28,073 --> 00:21:32,659
I'll make it.
I keep everything that belongs to my husband.

287
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,026
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:44,549
Newspaper clippings, employee pensions, life insurance,

289
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:51,830
Being a cop is not for the faint of heart, like my husband.

290
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:57,807
Still, in another three months, he'll get his pension.

291
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:03,377
Then he said he'd quit right away and take a job as a bank guard.

292
00:22:24,013 --> 00:22:24,701
Hello?

293
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:37,823
This is. It's a hobby of mine.
You already have all kinds of people coming to the spa, don't you?

294
00:22:38,113 --> 00:22:43,019
Newlyweds, corporate groups, dubious business associates...

295
00:22:43,293 --> 00:22:45,668
I take a photo of them

296
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:50,214
There's something good

297
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:52,949
One of these days I'm going to publish it in a photo magazine.

298
00:22:55,511 --> 00:22:56,605
What can I do for you?

299
00:22:57,558 --> 00:22:58,855
I'm looking for Nishiya inn

300
00:22:59,464 --> 00:23:00,332
Nishiya inn?

301
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:04,527
They are over the bridge

302
00:23:31,216 --> 00:23:31,950
Katayama

303
00:23:33,794 --> 00:23:37,075
Oh you.
How about a drink?

304
00:23:37,169 --> 00:23:40,560
Why did you retract your testimony?

305
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:45,099
We don't need to talk about that.
Let's drink

306
00:23:47,818 --> 00:23:49,411
You can't get drunk on this.

307
00:23:52,279 --> 00:23:57,333
Why did you retract your testimony?
One innocent person thrown in the dark because of you.
Just because of you, one innocent man is thrown in a dark place.

308
00:24:00,544 --> 00:24:02,193
Who's the one who shut your mouth?

309
00:24:04,419 --> 00:24:10,833
You've screwed up a lot of jobs because of your drinking.
And the IKUTA chief is the one who covered for you.

310
00:24:11,443 --> 00:24:14,934
You have to listen to him,right?

311
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:21,208
It was IKUTA who put you on leave, wasn't it?
If you get fired now, you won't get your pension.

312
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:27,474
Katayama-san, if you don't say anything, you're affirming what I said.

313
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,810
Please don't pick on me, too.

314
00:24:34,435 --> 00:24:39,364
I'm asking you for a favor
You're going to get a commendation for protecting a murderer?

315
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:43,067
The man with the scars... what if you catch him?

316
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,669
I don't know anybody with scars.

317
00:24:48,114 --> 00:24:54,169
You tell me you saw him. You tell us you saw him, and we'll give you something from our company in lieu of the bounty.

318
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:55,513
I'll talk to the director.

319
00:24:55,755 --> 00:24:56,685
lair

320
00:24:57,833 --> 00:25:01,810
No, it's true... our director takes drastic measures when he has to.

321
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:02,825
Shut up

322
00:25:04,255 --> 00:25:10,528
If you keep quiet...
This town won't get any better if you keep quiet.

323
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:12,560
Tell me the truth.

324
00:25:13,505 --> 00:25:14,263
You saw him?

325
00:25:14,591 --> 00:25:15,356
I don't know

326
00:25:17,239 --> 00:25:20,130
What are you so scared of?

327
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:21,653
I'm not scared.

328
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,470
What's this?

329
00:25:29,009 --> 00:25:32,298
How many cops would bring something like this?

330
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,503
I'm scared.

331
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:38,987
Scared of who?

332
00:25:40,058 --> 00:25:40,917
A killer

333
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:42,636
A killer?

334
00:25:44,347 --> 00:25:46,066
That's the guy with the scars.

335
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,364
He knows you're here?

336
00:25:53,692 --> 00:25:54,801
No

337
00:25:55,168 --> 00:25:57,528
Wait here, and don't go anywhere.

338
00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:08,264
I'll pick you up tonight at 8:00 and take you someplace safe.

339
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:16,899
A hotly contested game for the championship is well into the second half.

340
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:22,251
I miss rugby, this and that, but I used to be a college halfback.

341
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:26,024
Finally, the Toto Nippo has started a fancy sales pitch

342
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,727
They're going to bring professional baseball and sumo to our town.

343
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:30,681
Scared ?

344
00:26:31,337 --> 00:26:34,017
They have a lot of money

345
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,032
TOTO's capital is 700 million, ours is 720,000, roughly a hundred times more.

346
00:26:39,102 --> 00:26:42,759
Newspapers don't do business with entertainment, we do business with articles

347
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:43,985
Do you have a confident?

348
00:26:44,782 --> 00:26:46,821
I've never lost a game in my life.

349
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,290
I definitely win

350
00:26:51,165 --> 00:26:57,040
Toto will be in the red, and they'll pull out of Tokyo.

351
00:26:57,431 --> 00:26:58,384
Director

352
00:27:00,313 --> 00:27:03,633
You got news,right?

353
00:27:10,244 --> 00:27:11,166
8pm

354
00:27:12,573 --> 00:27:15,377
It's time to work

355
00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:20,112
This Katayama guy is a bit of a time bomb.

356
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:24,846
Once he explodes, it's not just the police, it'll blow up this town.

357
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:31,612
You can't risk it alone.
Take a couple of guys and take him to our inn.

358
00:27:32,487 --> 00:27:36,807
And while you're at it, check around for strippers.
That killer must be hanging around them

359
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:04,936
I'm from the SEIBU newspaper.

360
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,053
How many times have you been here?
That's enough!

361
00:28:10,886 --> 00:28:12,112
It's my first time.

362
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:20,174
You guys are like a gang of fools.
You go from door to door, taking pictures of people's houses.

363
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:22,573
You don't care about people's feelings.

364
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,925
I'm not

365
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:25,229
How could I know?

366
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,854
You know about Akiko?

367
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,128
go to the police and ask them.

368
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:31,550
I told them last night.

369
00:28:32,136 --> 00:28:33,393
I want to hear it from you.

370
00:28:36,745 --> 00:28:37,784
I'll call the police.

371
00:28:38,589 --> 00:28:41,245
It'll be more trouble than it's worth.
It's easier to talk.

372
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,870
We've been friends since we were girls' school in Shikoku.

373
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,401
Why did you live here together?

374
00:28:50,542 --> 00:28:52,542
We danced in the same theater.

375
00:28:54,096 --> 00:28:56,518
You must be popular.
You have a nice figure.

376
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,854
What do you want to talk?

377
00:29:02,307 --> 00:29:04,323
How did the Akiko look like when she left?

378
00:29:04,581 --> 00:29:07,182
She didn't want to.
He dragged her out.

379
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:09,042
He dragged her out?
Who?

380
00:29:09,292 --> 00:29:10,276
I don't know

381
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:11,159
What did he look like?

382
00:29:11,284 --> 00:29:12,698
I don't know

383
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,245
What if he's the one who killed her?

384
00:29:18,346 --> 00:29:19,315
Maybe it was the guy with the scars?

385
00:29:19,776 --> 00:29:20,745
I don't know

386
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:26,831
I know you'd love to get your hands on that story and make a few extra bucks, but...
But that has nothing to do with me.

387
00:29:27,909 --> 00:29:30,346
I'm not going to put my life on the line for you.

388
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:31,909
put your life on the line?

389
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,011
You sound like someone's scared of you.

390
00:29:38,143 --> 00:29:41,581
You're persistent.
I don't know. Go home

391
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,580
Hi, I'm Tokuhi

392
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,705
No... I know

393
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:08,994
I get it

394
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:16,017
Who?

395
00:30:17,041 --> 00:30:17,892
A friend

396
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:22,377
Very scary friend.

397
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:24,486
It's none of your business

398
00:30:25,627 --> 00:30:30,299
I'll tell you what, I'm a wimp anyway.

399
00:30:30,324 --> 00:30:31,361
It could be

400
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:37,541
I'm a dancer. just dancing is fine

401
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:42,627
Yeah, you're right. We're all so cute.
Call me if you changed your mind.

402
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,827
See you tomorrow.

403
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,280
My daughter is going to Europe next time.

404
00:31:07,483 --> 00:31:10,764
Your daughter who went to music school?

405
00:31:11,827 --> 00:31:14,381
She's going to France to study music.

406
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,413
That's nice

407
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:20,795
And before she leaves Japan, she wants to give a farewell concert in her hometown.

408
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:22,709
Can you support her?

409
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,389
Let me think.
I was surprised

410
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:34,873
There are a lot of gentlemen from this town here.
In the old days, they were all yakuza or fishermen's bosses.

411
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:39,100
I never thought music would come to this town.

412
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:41,225
The world has changed.

413
00:31:41,436 --> 00:31:42,131
Director

414
00:31:43,483 --> 00:31:44,327
Excuse me

415
00:31:51,321 --> 00:31:53,524
You've got a lot of face.

416
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,394
What's wrong?

417
00:31:59,831 --> 00:32:04,730
The hit man took out AKIKO.
A girl named Motomi lives with him. She won't give us his description.

418
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,308
I see, so?

419
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,894
So I'll go one more time tomorrow and stick with it.

420
00:32:12,206 --> 00:32:13,019
Don't push it.

421
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:15,394
She's quite pretty.

422
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:18,675
I'll go get Katayama-san.

423
00:32:19,081 --> 00:32:20,433
Drink before you go

424
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,863
Give him sake

425
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:25,996
What do you want?

426
00:32:26,051 --> 00:32:26,527
High ball

427
00:32:26,746 --> 00:32:27,262
High ball

428
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,035
Another wine

429
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:32,168
You'll lose your stomach after the next surgery.

430
00:32:32,457 --> 00:32:34,168
Since when are you my wife?

431
00:32:34,355 --> 00:32:35,519
Since three years ago.

432
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:38,949
Bon appétit!

433
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,248
You even drink like me.

434
00:32:48,545 --> 00:32:49,256
Work hard

435
00:32:49,475 --> 00:32:50,717
Thank you for the drink.

436
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:56,611
He's a pretty boy

437
00:32:56,845 --> 00:32:57,923
Yes

438
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:14,162
What are you doing here?

439
00:33:14,654 --> 00:33:15,842
I came to see Katayama-san.

440
00:33:16,896 --> 00:33:18,326
Katayama's dead.

441
00:33:19,084 --> 00:33:20,553
Who killed him?

442
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:22,857
He killed himself.

443
00:33:23,053 --> 00:33:23,475
What?

444
00:33:25,139 --> 00:33:27,701
He shot himself in the temple with his own gun.

445
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:31,904
The shot was not heard over the noise from the pachinko parlor in front.

446
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:34,084
The maid found him at 7:30.

447
00:33:35,154 --> 00:33:38,107
I can't believe it

448
00:33:39,131 --> 00:33:41,936
There's no question about it.
That's what the lab said.

449
00:33:42,576 --> 00:33:43,248
No

450
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,896
What?

451
00:33:45,373 --> 00:33:46,943
no, he was murdered.

452
00:34:01,296 --> 00:34:02,351
They're terrible people.

453
00:34:04,023 --> 00:34:07,546
Hey, Seibu Shimbun, don't make up some crazy story!

454
00:34:13,257 --> 00:34:13,898
I see

455
00:34:14,015 --> 00:34:18,328
Mr. Director, please let me write
I want to take Katayama's place.

456
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,798
What do you think?

457
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,627
Leave it to him

458
00:34:24,072 --> 00:34:24,838
How about you,Desk?

459
00:34:26,197 --> 00:34:27,166
I'm for it

460
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:31,095
Ok. We'll leave it to you

461
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,525
But don't assume Katayama was murdered.
There's no clear evidence.

462
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,502
It's a questionable suicide.

463
00:35:00,258 --> 00:35:01,305
Yeah

464
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:10,198
What's wrong?

465
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,034
The boss wants to see you.

466
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,854
Boss?
Why?

467
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:18,362
I don't know.

468
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,354
Come to the office at 10:00.

469
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,545
Get in the car,Ishizuka

470
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,389
How's your business?

471
00:35:45,459 --> 00:35:48,842
It's not good

472
00:35:51,784 --> 00:35:55,886
Oh yes, please come to my house tonight for Yuki's birthday!

473
00:35:56,722 --> 00:36:00,714
He became fat.
He eats a lot

474
00:36:02,104 --> 00:36:06,159
If Mr. Ishizuka hadn't been there, we'd be celebrating the first anniversary of his death.

475
00:36:06,612 --> 00:36:11,034
It's amazing what the newspapers can do.
You flew in the plane and delivered the medicine.

476
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:14,315
What's wrong?

477
00:36:14,683 --> 00:36:15,206
Nothing

478
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:17,425
You're kind of weird, aren't you?

479
00:36:19,651 --> 00:36:22,612
Oh, yeah, you said you were going to HIROSE.

480
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:24,440
I got a call.

481
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,222
You shouldn't go.

482
00:36:28,745 --> 00:36:31,542
I wonder if you've seen a gangster with a scar on his chin.

483
00:36:31,597 --> 00:36:35,393
I saw him in the paper this morning... the hit man.

484
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:37,393
Why don't you check with your buddies?

485
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:43,284
But be careful about Hirose

486
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,246
Shall I wait for you?

487
00:36:50,363 --> 00:36:50,801
No thanks

488
00:37:10,954 --> 00:37:12,758
How about golf?

489
00:37:13,141 --> 00:37:17,962
I'll enjoy golf when I'm a minister.

490
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,712
I see.
Please take this

491
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:24,032
I'll take this

492
00:37:24,954 --> 00:37:30,899
But that doesn't mean we should make it sound like the bill will pass the Diet anytime soon.

493
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:35,801
SEIBU's Ishizuka is here

494
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:48,978
Have a seat.I read the morning paper.
It's good.

495
00:37:50,377 --> 00:37:52,166
But there's a lot of bullshit in there.

496
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,421
But you've got guts.

497
00:37:57,366 --> 00:37:58,577
What can I do for you?

498
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:06,272
I'm bringing the Aoki Circus to town.
You know it?

499
00:38:07,428 --> 00:38:09,772
The best circus in the Orient, they say.

500
00:38:10,577 --> 00:38:15,014
I'd like to invite the children of unemployed coal miners for free on the first day.

501
00:38:15,569 --> 00:38:19,624
With lunch and snacks.
At the end of the day, they take a picture.

502
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:23,475
You're supposed to sit in the middle of them and smile.

503
00:38:26,808 --> 00:38:32,097
We have two weeks before the first day.
I want you to write an article about the circus.

504
00:38:32,449 --> 00:38:35,668
Put in a picture or a cartoon.
Here's one.

505
00:38:37,175 --> 00:38:39,879
write something funny for the kids.

506
00:38:42,566 --> 00:38:46,050
Before the election, you're supposed to be a good?

507
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,496
You should listen to him

508
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:50,050
Be polite

509
00:38:51,879 --> 00:38:53,097
is that all?

510
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,160
Don't let your brush tip slide too far when you're young.

511
00:38:58,277 --> 00:39:00,418
Well, I just thought I'd give you a heads-up.

512
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:05,324
Once I start running, I can't stop.

513
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:27,290
Torii went to the hospital this morning to pick up Akiko's body.

514
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:32,050
I hope Professa and that German bastard go to their deaths soon!

515
00:39:32,075 --> 00:39:32,940
Really

516
00:39:51,187 --> 00:39:52,359
What are you doing here?

517
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:54,750
I thought it was about time you had a conscience.

518
00:39:55,109 --> 00:39:56,593
I don't know anything about that.

519
00:39:57,015 --> 00:40:00,796
You don't hate the man who killed Akiko?
She's your friend.

520
00:40:00,821 --> 00:40:01,570
Stop it

521
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:09,183
I won't stop until you open your mouth.

522
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:10,542
Get hands off of me

523
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:17,206
What are you doing with her?

524
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:19,698
We were both remembering Akiko.

525
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,362
Shut up

526
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:25,714
You mess with this woman, you're gonna get yourself in trouble.

527
00:40:27,121 --> 00:40:28,199
 be careful with that.

528
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,667
I'll see you again.

529
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:46,049
Poor girl. Killing such a beautiful young woman.
She was even having a baby.

530
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:46,979
baby?

531
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:52,917
When they brought her here, they shed their kimonos, and I recognized it at a glance.I'm a woman.

532
00:40:53,662 --> 00:40:54,522
From 3 pm

533
00:40:58,506 --> 00:40:59,975
Dr.Inakami

534
00:41:00,178 --> 00:41:01,467
Oh you

535
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:02,998
Are you at work?

536
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:08,795
I'm working part-time on a manuscript for some extra cash.

537
00:41:10,065 --> 00:41:11,745
you can get cancer in your 20s

538
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,799
Yeah,Be careful.

539
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:18,877
You performed an autopsy on Akiko's body.

540
00:41:18,917 --> 00:41:19,456
Yeah

541
00:41:19,807 --> 00:41:21,581
Are the results as published in the newspaper?

542
00:41:21,606 --> 00:41:22,135
Yeah

543
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:23,581
Is there anything suspicious?

544
00:41:23,901 --> 00:41:25,182
You withheld something, didn't you?

545
00:41:25,323 --> 00:41:25,846
No

546
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:28,049
Akiko is pregnant, isn't she?

547
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,338
What the hell?

548
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:31,838
How many months was she?

549
00:41:32,377 --> 00:41:33,995
What are you talking about?

550
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:36,573
Show me the original autopsy report.

551
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:38,479
I can't

552
00:41:39,948 --> 00:41:41,901
Then the court will hear your case.

553
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:43,854
Bye

554
00:41:46,758 --> 00:41:47,797
Wait

555
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:50,797
I tell you

556
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:55,485
How many months was she?

557
00:41:56,563 --> 00:42:00,032
She was five months pregnant.
The fetus was stunted, so it wasn't obvious.

558
00:42:00,258 --> 00:42:01,547
Why didn't you publish it?

559
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:03,946
Ikuta told me

560
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:05,586
Ikuta?

561
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:12,938
He says it's because he's only trying to defame her, not because he's involved in a crime.

562
00:42:13,071 --> 00:42:19,118
Why is that irrelevant?
The police say Ochiai strangled AKIKO out of romantic entanglement.

563
00:42:19,532 --> 00:42:25,672
If she was five months pregnant, AKIKO was going to have a baby.
How she could fall in love with Ochiai?

564
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:31,641
I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't mention it.

565
00:42:32,391 --> 00:42:33,766
It would jeopardize my position.

566
00:42:35,188 --> 00:42:36,039
I'm sorry to disturb you.

567
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:44,264
This region has always been a Conservative area.

568
00:42:44,702 --> 00:42:49,991
How we've worked so hard to build a groundswell of innovation.
And now it's all gone to shit.

569
00:42:50,116 --> 00:42:51,124
I'm sorry to hear that.

570
00:42:52,513 --> 00:42:55,989
There are only two days left to vote.
If we don't, we'll lose the election.

571
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:05,685
The revolutionary party has no choice but to back down.

572
00:43:05,935 --> 00:43:11,044
You guys came in here on your own and started this election.
We can't be responsible for it.

573
00:43:14,619 --> 00:43:15,572
Secretary General.

574
00:43:17,244 --> 00:43:18,361
Who are you?

575
00:43:19,017 --> 00:43:20,384
I'm a reporter for the SEIBU newspaper.

576
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:22,478
I have no use for you.

577
00:43:23,025 --> 00:43:24,884
Have you come to pick up another bad news story?

578
00:43:25,095 --> 00:43:27,439
I'm here to help you.

579
00:43:27,822 --> 00:43:30,048
I'm busy.

580
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:32,908
Do you want to send Mr. Ochiai to jail?

581
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:34,822
What?

582
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:39,814
Believe in the power of newspapers.
Modern newspapers have more power than the police.

583
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,950
What the hell was that information AKIKO brought to you in the first place?

584
00:43:48,614 --> 00:43:54,513
Toto Newspaper is now buying up newsstands and shutting down our newspaper. They want to shut down our newspapers.

585
00:43:54,677 --> 00:43:57,372
They have money because they raised newspaper prices.

586
00:43:57,810 --> 00:44:01,396
I heard they loaded up Hirose, the distributor's boss, with a lot of cash.

587
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,896
We should be careful of him

588
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,591
How long have you been a reporter?

589
00:44:09,536 --> 00:44:15,427
Hirose may be a prick, but he's not that stupid.
I'd know that if he made an enemy of me.

590
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:17,857
but...

591
00:44:17,882 --> 00:44:20,013
If you're struggling, you're gonna get thin-headed.

592
00:44:22,349 --> 00:44:25,317
I tracked down the hit man and found out some good news.

593
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:27,911
Ochiai's campaign office found out.

594
00:44:28,177 --> 00:44:28,747
What?

595
00:44:30,099 --> 00:44:33,825
Remember the U.S. Army campground in the center of the city?

596
00:44:34,067 --> 00:44:35,833
It was crawling with women of the night.

597
00:44:36,169 --> 00:44:43,255
The city forced the original owner to buy it from the city for a low price to expand a planned urban road.

598
00:44:45,994 --> 00:44:47,345
Yeah last year

599
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,564
But the city suddenly canceled the project.

600
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,744
It happens every time.

601
00:44:51,235 --> 00:44:53,548
They're going to sell it to the private sector again.

602
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,533
So, what's the bottom line?

603
00:44:55,837 --> 00:45:04,165
At that time, the mayor, the former alderman, and the main alderman... They gave it to Hirose for nothing.

604
00:45:04,955 --> 00:45:10,236
Hirose is now planning to make a fortune by building a movie theater and a Turkish bath there.

605
00:45:11,353 --> 00:45:12,283
You have proof?

606
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:15,431
AKIKO was supposed to sell that information to Ochiai.

607
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:16,314
AKIKO?

608
00:45:16,587 --> 00:45:20,744
AKIKO happened to be invited to the entertainment and witnessed the scene of the alderman's bribe.

609
00:45:20,853 --> 00:45:21,447
I see

610
00:45:21,806 --> 00:45:26,189
Why don't we do everything we can to expose this corruption?

611
00:45:31,155 --> 00:45:36,116
Let's put Hirose in jail.
It's time for the old man to pay his dues.

612
00:45:37,553 --> 00:45:38,210
Let's get it on

613
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,069
How about you?

614
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,163
I'm willing to do

615
00:45:43,272 --> 00:45:47,624
Hey, Ishizuka.
You're getting a little sharp around here.

616
00:45:47,749 --> 00:45:49,421
Not so much.

617
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:53,280
You're just starting out.

618
00:45:54,350 --> 00:45:55,796
Tidy up

619
00:45:59,055 --> 00:46:01,711
Work hard

620
00:46:03,446 --> 00:46:07,016
A man named Mr. Yamano is here

621
00:46:07,258 --> 00:46:08,047
Yamano?

622
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:10,446
Yamano

623
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:13,641
I know who has the scars.

624
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:18,352
One of our guys picked him up from the station about five days ago.

625
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:19,407
Where'd he go?

626
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:22,094
At HIROSE's house.

627
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:25,094
Don't tell anyone.

628
00:46:25,625 --> 00:46:27,118
Life is precious.

629
00:46:33,308 --> 00:46:36,066
I'm a gangster and I play the trumpet.

630
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:40,441
She's the only one I took seriously.

631
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:46,925
And she took me seriously.

632
00:46:50,183 --> 00:46:51,612
I'm glad

633
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:53,769
She was nice to me, too.

634
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:56,894
She was nice to everyone

635
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:00,417
She was so nice

636
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,823
Ochiai killed her

637
00:47:09,589 --> 00:47:10,526
Why you are here?

638
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:14,019
You've come to interrupt?

639
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:16,331
I'm here to give her flower

640
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:23,948
you don't know how Akiko felt.

641
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:26,847
Why don't you care who killed Akiko?

642
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:33,722
He'll be executed or
I'll kill him.

643
00:47:33,987 --> 00:47:37,441
Ochiai didn't kill her but the one with the scars.

644
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:40,156
Don't say bullshit

645
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:41,906
If you think I'm lying, ask Motomi.

646
00:47:42,148 --> 00:47:46,758
You're ridiculous.
Why are you following me around?

647
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,281
It's fate, I guess.

648
00:47:51,406 --> 00:47:53,484
You like her?

649
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:57,883
yeah I like her

650
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:06,105
Don't touch her

651
00:48:06,417 --> 00:48:09,105
Who asked me to do this?
Your boss, Hirose.

652
00:48:09,589 --> 00:48:10,644
What?

653
00:48:12,549 --> 00:48:14,542
Call me if you change your mind, right?

654
00:48:15,307 --> 00:48:16,909
You're insist

655
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:22,518
I'll beat you

656
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,534
Good night

657
00:48:30,445 --> 00:48:32,594
He's bullshit

658
00:48:41,261 --> 00:48:43,761
I hear you're quite pleased with what you're saying.

659
00:48:44,331 --> 00:48:47,347
The police are incompetent.

660
00:48:47,597 --> 00:48:49,480
You're very quick on the uptake, aren't you?

661
00:48:50,753 --> 00:48:53,097
That's not your wisdom.
Who asked you?

662
00:48:53,816 --> 00:48:56,761
Did Ochiai and the rest of the revolutionary party find you?

663
00:48:56,855 --> 00:49:00,214
Don't be ridiculous.
Who asked you to look into me?

664
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:01,628
I asked

665
00:49:03,222 --> 00:49:03,995
I see

666
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:06,144
What's the hell who you are

667
00:49:07,050 --> 00:49:11,550
You people think that the revolutionary party is progressive as long as it attacks the Conservative Party.

668
00:49:12,441 --> 00:49:15,745
I've been mayor for ten years and the city is thriving.

669
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:19,472
I'm not doing a stingy job.

670
00:49:20,066 --> 00:49:21,433
Who made the money?

671
00:49:21,956 --> 00:49:23,175
Newspapers are violent.

672
00:49:23,589 --> 00:49:28,448
They write lies about what is and isn't true.
It may be free speech, but I won't allow it.

673
00:49:29,003 --> 00:49:31,433
I can't forgive them

674
00:49:33,433 --> 00:49:38,112
What are you going to do?
Kill him like Officer Katayama? Use a hit man?

675
00:49:39,066 --> 00:49:42,667
Or pay me off to keep my mouth shut like he did with IKUTA?

676
00:49:43,261 --> 00:49:43,910
What the hell?

677
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:51,121
you're reading a lousy report and doing a blinkered version

678
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:52,230
You don't know anything.

679
00:49:52,464 --> 00:49:53,558
Ikuta is being paid off?

680
00:49:53,996 --> 00:49:59,160
not only him but also Aldermen and maybe even the mayor.

681
00:49:59,668 --> 00:50:00,519
SEIBU

682
00:50:00,544 --> 00:50:01,363
Pls Shut up.

683
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:04,418
Shut up?
Come with me

684
00:50:13,423 --> 00:50:17,228
I'm the one who made you the director of this place.

685
00:50:18,126 --> 00:50:21,884
I spoke to the police department and they selected you, a countryman.

686
00:50:23,251 --> 00:50:27,900
If you wanted to wear this shiny uniform forever...
Get rid of him.

687
00:50:35,366 --> 00:50:39,608
You talked about it and decided to hook me up with a misdemeanor?

688
00:50:39,741 --> 00:50:40,718
Don't be stupid.

689
00:50:41,444 --> 00:50:42,929
Is it true about Ikuta?

690
00:50:44,531 --> 00:50:47,438
Ikuta ignored the report that he saw the hit man.

691
00:50:48,274 --> 00:50:51,516
He didn't disclose the fact that Akiko Strip was five months pregnant.

692
00:50:52,102 --> 00:50:54,680
Secrets come with the territory.
I can't disclose every single one.

693
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:01,508
I understand you're protective of your men.But one day you'll be strangled.

694
00:51:04,598 --> 00:51:06,466
I want an answer by the end of the day tomorrow.

695
00:51:10,356 --> 00:51:12,262
The director wants to see you.

696
00:51:14,419 --> 00:51:18,325
I'm sure he'll give you a letter of commendation.
For your excellent work on the case.

697
00:51:19,153 --> 00:51:20,809
The director wants to see you.

698
00:51:23,807 --> 00:51:24,697
What did you tell the director?

699
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:26,674
He'll tell you.

700
00:51:27,447 --> 00:51:28,729
Your tie's crooked.

701
00:51:31,566 --> 00:51:32,144
Wife

702
00:51:33,292 --> 00:51:34,152
I feel so bad

703
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:35,292
What did they talk about?

704
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:37,074
About his pension

705
00:51:37,464 --> 00:51:38,425
They won't give you?

706
00:51:38,831 --> 00:51:40,785
They'll let you out, but on one condition.

707
00:51:41,495 --> 00:51:42,308
What's the condition?

708
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:47,831
They want me to prove that my husband was crazy when he took his leave.

709
00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:55,511
Then they said they would pay me a special severance package, even though He would be three months short.
They told me I would have trouble making ends meet from now on.

710
00:51:57,163 --> 00:51:58,390
They are a jerk.

711
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:06,061
But I don't want to.
I don't want to say that my husband was crazy. I feel sorry for that man who died.

712
00:52:11,079 --> 00:52:18,016
I'm sorry, but I don't need my severance pay anymore.
If I work, I can make it.

713
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,033
I'm still 52

714
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:28,925
You're right.
This project...

715
00:52:29,183 --> 00:52:31,972
we've got some interesting stuff here.

716
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:35,254
A collection of human faces.

717
00:52:35,394 --> 00:52:37,909
Humans have strange faces.

718
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,949
Like a pig, not a pig. Like a raccoon, not a raccoon.

719
00:52:41,238 --> 00:52:42,714
Humans are monsters, aren't we?

720
00:52:46,105 --> 00:52:51,160
Why don't we take a break and look at these pictures?
The Human Zoo

721
00:52:51,783 --> 00:52:53,893
I'm gonna vote for this guy.

722
00:52:54,494 --> 00:52:56,377
That's one hell of a scar you got there.

723
00:52:56,768 --> 00:52:58,260
He's like wolf

724
00:53:07,959 --> 00:53:09,100
527

725
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:16,771
Hello, is this Ishida Photo Agency?

726
00:53:17,061 --> 00:53:17,913
Yes

727
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,952
Yes, sir.
I shot it two days ago and sent it to you right away.

728
00:53:25,530 --> 00:53:29,483
No actor in the movies has a face like that.

729
00:53:29,866 --> 00:53:30,882
Where did you see him?

730
00:53:31,155 --> 00:53:34,530
I took this telephoto shot of him wandering around the bridge.

731
00:53:37,007 --> 00:53:41,390
Of course, the inn is in the background.
I cropped it down to just his face.

732
00:53:42,499 --> 00:53:44,429
I have the negative of the photo.

733
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:48,781
I'll get it later

734
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:52,367
Vote? maybe

735
00:53:54,312 --> 00:53:56,835
He's a killer.

736
00:53:58,406 --> 00:53:59,523
How do you know?

737
00:54:00,351 --> 00:54:04,179
The day before yesterday, Officer Katayama died.
He walked through the same hot spring resort that day.

738
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:05,968
That's not much to go on.

739
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:07,781
It's just a hunch.
I'm sure it's him.

740
00:54:08,156 --> 00:54:09,296
Yeah, good hunch.

741
00:54:10,796 --> 00:54:12,429
It's about to get interesting.

742
00:54:13,468 --> 00:54:17,140
Show this picture to AKIKO's friends.

743
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:21,859
If she looks any different, go to the police right away. Find out his criminal record.

744
00:54:24,222 --> 00:54:28,222
The police can't leave him alone if they have this much evidence.

745
00:54:42,150 --> 00:54:43,072
Welcome

746
00:54:47,174 --> 00:54:50,096
You call me a lot

747
00:54:50,697 --> 00:54:54,494
I wanted to see you.
What you wanna drink?

748
00:54:54,611 --> 00:54:55,658
I don't wanna drink anything

749
00:54:56,549 --> 00:54:58,807
No matter how many time we meet,
It is pointless

750
00:54:59,642 --> 00:55:02,807
Continuity is the key to love.

751
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:04,439
Depends on who you're talking to.

752
00:55:05,824 --> 00:55:06,847
You're not going to change your mind?

753
00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:08,605
No

754
00:55:08,996 --> 00:55:10,160
Then why did you come out here?

755
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:15,433
I came to tell you that it's not safe for you to hang around me any longer.

756
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,285
This guy might kill me?

757
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,449
You may recognize him... the man who took Akiko out.

758
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,441
I don't know him.

759
00:55:28,405 --> 00:55:30,788
Well, that's all right.
Call me if you remember.

760
00:55:33,405 --> 00:55:34,069
Hold on.

761
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:38,233
What?

762
00:55:38,991 --> 00:55:40,725
You really need to stay away from me.

763
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,772
I don't want to.
I can't back out of a girl I like.

764
00:55:44,928 --> 00:55:49,897
I was sent out here today to check on you.

765
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,725
I know that.

766
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:53,788
You're idiot

767
00:55:54,796 --> 00:55:56,085
I know that too

768
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:59,468
But I was born that way.
There's no point in me hating my parents.

769
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:01,335
You don't either?

770
00:56:02,741 --> 00:56:05,522
I have no parents

771
00:56:06,022 --> 00:56:06,803
You're gonna miss them?

772
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:07,983
I'll be fine.

773
00:56:09,014 --> 00:56:10,382
I have had a lot of boyfriends

774
00:56:11,444 --> 00:56:16,162
If I make you my wife, my father and mother will be happy.
They'll celebrate with rice cakes.

775
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,733
Our rice cakes are just as good as yours.

776
00:56:18,889 --> 00:56:20,397
Don't be silly.

777
00:56:27,605 --> 00:56:31,699
This guy is a great criminal.
Five counts of murder, five counts of assault, Jiro Mori.

778
00:56:32,417 --> 00:56:37,167
He's not famous around here.
But in Kanto, he's a notorious killer the police have to keep an eye on. In the Kanto region, the police are keeping a close eye on him.

779
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,705
Call Nakayama officer

780
00:56:45,588 --> 00:56:46,080
Ishizuka

781
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:46,986
What?

782
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,541
I tell you

783
00:56:50,892 --> 00:56:57,204
Ochiai is the victim.He's the one who did it.
I'll make sure we catch him. He's not the only one.

784
00:56:58,345 --> 00:57:01,877
We'll also look into the people behind him.

785
00:57:03,361 --> 00:57:06,181
Even Alderman or mayor

786
00:57:06,588 --> 00:57:08,017
What did Mr. Ikuta say?

787
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,533
He was placed on administrative leave.

788
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:15,322
Who gave him money?

789
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:18,127
HE didn't say.
He's idiot

790
00:57:21,537 --> 00:57:24,631
But it's not Ikuta who's to blame.
It's the people who paid him off.

791
00:57:25,482 --> 00:57:30,318
Cops are paid a drop in the bucket.

792
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:34,117
Cops can't help it if they're a little tempted by money.

793
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:38,187
Me either

794
00:57:39,383 --> 00:57:41,758
It took me a long time to get where I am.

795
00:57:42,039 --> 00:57:44,883
I don't want to leave it.

796
00:57:46,187 --> 00:57:50,711
But I'm still a cop.
I'm a cop to the bone.

797
00:57:51,625 --> 00:57:54,602
I'm not gonna let a crime go unpunished.

798
00:57:55,898 --> 00:57:56,875
Nakayama officer is not here

799
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:57,695
no?

800
00:57:58,234 --> 00:58:01,531
He went to the Otani hot springs where the body was found dead a few hours ago.

801
00:58:02,258 --> 00:58:05,734
Otani Hot Springs.
Who died?

802
00:58:06,164 --> 00:58:07,359
The photographer at the entrance.

803
00:58:07,703 --> 00:58:08,508
The photographer

804
00:58:18,101 --> 00:58:18,827
Seibu Shimbun.

805
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,397
There is no negative

806
00:58:44,671 --> 00:58:46,194
Try to find somehow

807
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:49,335
This is not clear

808
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,040
Please

809
00:58:55,954 --> 00:58:56,837
Welcome

810
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:01,735
Good evening.
It's finally the Kyushu series between Japan and Seibu Newspaper.

811
00:59:02,329 --> 00:59:07,946
We don't stand a chance.
You're on home turf.You've got ACE, don't you?

812
00:59:08,009 --> 00:59:10,134
Even if we trade Hirose for a home run hitter...

813
00:59:10,657 --> 00:59:15,063
The trade price is too high.

814
00:59:18,063 --> 00:59:21,891
I've always wondered why you don't get a wife.

815
00:59:22,532 --> 00:59:25,422
I mean, you're a good-looking guy, so I'm sure there's no shortage of women.

816
00:59:25,447 --> 00:59:27,391
I have no one to be my wife.

817
00:59:27,524 --> 00:59:30,391
You're lair.
You like to work so much?

818
00:59:30,586 --> 00:59:33,016
I have no choice but to work

819
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:37,455
Here comes the cute little guy.

820
00:59:39,908 --> 00:59:43,064
What's the matter? You don't look well.

821
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:51,724
Don't get upset just because the photographer was killed.
It's as if we've discovered who the enemy really is.

822
00:59:51,927 --> 00:59:55,677
That's what I'm wondering, how did they know about the photographers?

823
00:59:56,388 --> 00:59:57,864
Did you tell anyone about the photograph?

824
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:00,739
No one.
I just showed it to Motomi.

825
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:05,419
We must have a spy in there somewhere.

826
01:00:09,307 --> 01:00:10,706
Cheer up

827
01:00:12,456 --> 01:00:16,073
In my experience. In times like this, I don't think about it. I just get drunk and I go to bed.

828
01:00:16,276 --> 01:00:20,495
You wake up in the morning and you have a good idea.

829
01:00:23,042 --> 01:00:25,659
Cheer up

830
01:00:30,019 --> 01:00:30,706
What do you wanna drink?

831
01:00:30,839 --> 01:00:31,386
High ball

832
01:00:31,487 --> 01:00:33,667
High ball for him.
I'll have one as usual

833
01:00:34,816 --> 01:00:39,409
But one after another, important witnesses are being erased.
I don't know what to do.

834
01:00:41,076 --> 01:00:43,912
You said you were going to copy me.
Have you forgotten?

835
01:00:44,076 --> 01:00:45,060
I haven't forgotten.

836
01:00:45,201 --> 01:00:49,310
Then drink, drink, and sleep tonight... like a baby.

837
01:00:52,411 --> 01:00:53,403
Damn it!

838
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:15,658
Damn it!
Where the hell is SPY?

839
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:16,712
Are you alright?

840
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:20,056
It's just this much booze.

841
01:01:21,939 --> 01:01:25,837
I was frustrated.

842
01:01:26,533 --> 01:01:28,525
I get it. I get it.

843
01:01:37,291 --> 01:01:40,892
I'm sorry.
Good night.

844
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:47,543
Good night.

845
01:01:50,637 --> 01:01:51,606
Damn it!

846
01:01:53,684 --> 01:01:54,465
Good night.

847
01:01:54,996 --> 01:01:56,637
Where the hell is SPY?

848
01:01:59,457 --> 01:02:00,418
To Kagetsu

849
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:14,824
He's been waiting for you

850
01:02:18,074 --> 01:02:19,683
He's here

851
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:22,347
Sorry I'm late

852
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,699
That's enough

853
01:02:25,339 --> 01:02:26,589
What drink?

854
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:29,347
Give me English whiskey

855
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:30,488
The Whiskey you got from Governor?

856
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:31,261
Yeah

857
01:02:34,472 --> 01:02:35,589
What's wrong?

858
01:02:39,683 --> 01:02:43,824
I'm talking about the TOTO Daily News.
Mr. Hirose, are you trying to give them a boost?

859
01:02:43,941 --> 01:02:48,167
You're an idiot.
There's always been a SEIBU newspaper in this area.

860
01:02:48,792 --> 01:02:55,003
I'm the one who brought you here from Tokyo in the first place.
I helped you make it into a prestigious newspaper.

861
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,027
In return, I helped you a lot.

862
01:03:01,206 --> 01:03:03,933
I did most of the work that made you a household name.

863
01:03:04,628 --> 01:03:08,449
I never wrote a single bad thing about you.
But I've promoted the good ones with a tail.

864
01:03:09,797 --> 01:03:11,656
I'd appreciate it

865
01:03:12,883 --> 01:03:15,859
But it's up to you.

866
01:03:16,391 --> 01:03:16,969
You mean?

867
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,852
How are you handling this case?
You let ishujuka say whatever he wants.

868
01:03:23,625 --> 01:03:25,125
In return, I do SPY.

869
01:03:25,734 --> 01:03:28,695
Don't publish anything Ishizuka writes.

870
01:03:29,891 --> 01:03:30,414
OK

871
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,617
But there are two conditions.

872
01:03:34,172 --> 01:03:34,867
What is it?

873
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:37,695
To stop TOTO Nippo from moving in.

874
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:39,695
and?

875
01:03:39,969 --> 01:03:41,617
Do not touch the Ishizuka

876
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:43,422
Is that it?

877
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:44,422
Yeah

878
01:03:56,281 --> 01:03:59,359
Dunlop balls are the only way to go.

879
01:03:59,609 --> 01:04:01,781
Even I can get up to 95.

880
01:04:01,984 --> 01:04:03,758
No, it's your skill, Mr. Mayor.

881
01:04:04,046 --> 01:04:05,328
Nice pad

882
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,875
I got slimmer since I play golf

883
01:04:10,445 --> 01:04:12,070
I'm ten years younger.

884
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:13,805
So your bed life too?

885
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,430
Can you introduce me some young girls?

886
01:04:17,500 --> 01:04:19,039
Well, I guess I'll be making my campaign speech.

887
01:04:20,008 --> 01:04:21,984
I'm going to make one last push.

888
01:04:22,914 --> 01:04:29,422
I just heard something.
I heard the police started an investigation into the camp's down payment.

889
01:04:34,718 --> 01:04:35,921
That man

890
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:41,413
Call Mr. Hirose.

891
01:04:41,601 --> 01:04:44,108
I hope we are okay.
The police are on the warpath these days.

892
01:04:44,476 --> 01:04:49,593
Don't worry.
In a democracy, the police are the politicians' watchdogs.

893
01:04:49,952 --> 01:04:52,569
Bite the thief, but wag their tail to their master.

894
01:04:52,803 --> 01:04:57,241
All cops, leave your caps on and meet me at the editor's office.
You got it.

895
01:04:59,296 --> 01:04:59,944
Hey Bombshell.

896
01:05:00,015 --> 01:05:00,819
What's going on?

897
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:05,249
I'm trying to figure out how Hirose GROUP does it.

898
01:05:06,211 --> 01:05:12,023
Every business in this region is related to Hirose.

899
01:05:12,484 --> 01:05:15,867
Almost all Hirose's siblings, subsidiaries, and major shareholders.

900
01:05:16,297 --> 01:05:19,945
Representatives, prefectural assemblymen, city councilmen.
They all have Hirose strings attached.

901
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,250
The gang has 1,000 members.

902
01:05:23,320 --> 01:05:26,117
They always come at the sound of Hirose's voice.

903
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:29,875
What's the matter?
You seem awfully serious.

904
01:05:29,900 --> 01:05:31,062
I knew it.

905
01:05:31,211 --> 01:05:31,781
What?

906
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,242
There's no Hirose spy here

907
01:05:34,789 --> 01:05:38,398
Mr. Ishizuka, you haven't woken up from your hangover!

908
01:05:38,805 --> 01:05:39,820
What do you mean about spy?

909
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:41,898
You smell like garlic.

910
01:05:42,101 --> 01:05:44,250
I like dumpling

911
01:05:45,156 --> 01:05:46,703
What do you mean about spy?

912
01:05:47,633 --> 01:05:49,797
 I'm sorry, that's a little boring.

913
01:05:50,016 --> 01:05:52,945
Why don't you go lie down in the infirmary for an hour or so?

914
01:05:53,430 --> 01:05:56,961
Our new nurse is so sexy

915
01:05:58,242 --> 01:06:00,125
Are you guys doing ok?

916
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,914
It's always good to see you in high gear.

917
01:06:03,203 --> 01:06:06,867
Hirose is very suspicious

918
01:06:08,016 --> 01:06:11,531
But he shows no evidence.

919
01:06:13,711 --> 01:06:17,625
Does he have any proof?

920
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:24,562
Without it, all our investigations will be speculation.
We can't write an article if it's speculation.

921
01:06:31,164 --> 01:06:36,273
I hear you've been subpoenaing aldermen one by one since this morning.
Do we have a warrant for the D.A.?

922
01:06:36,820 --> 01:06:40,242
I'm just asking as a witness.

923
01:06:41,195 --> 01:06:44,851
How much of his corruption is based on this?

924
01:06:45,258 --> 01:06:49,594
I've been doing a little canvassing.

925
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:54,789
It's thoughtless of you to ask a city councilman to come in here like that.

926
01:06:54,906 --> 01:06:55,969
What do you want?

927
01:06:57,601 --> 01:07:01,266
The police are there to keep the peace.

928
01:07:01,562 --> 01:07:06,164
What you're doing is the opposite.
You're disrupting the calm of society, unsettling people's minds.

929
01:07:06,641 --> 01:07:10,242
You sound like a Communist.
I will not allow you to do that.

930
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:14,930
On behalf of the entire bar association, I'm saying this.
That's all I'm saying.

931
01:07:21,089 --> 01:07:21,550
Who?

932
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:23,230
He's a lawyer for HIROSE.

933
01:07:23,378 --> 01:07:24,269
He's harassing you

934
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:26,362
I'm fine.
I'm ready.

935
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:28,300
Has the corruption investigation opened up any room for maneuvering?

936
01:07:29,386 --> 01:07:31,042
It's hard to find evidence.

937
01:07:32,511 --> 01:07:36,753
I can give you a name or two.
And that's it.

938
01:07:37,886 --> 01:07:41,065
Their mouths are tied with gold.

939
01:07:41,948 --> 01:07:43,394
They don't say

940
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:47,909
HIROSE is holding a woman and look how we do

941
01:07:48,245 --> 01:07:49,589
What about the hit man?

942
01:07:49,894 --> 01:07:50,933
I can't track him again.

943
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:57,339
After all, this is the home of the Yakuza.
Once he's in, it's hard to get out.

944
01:07:58,322 --> 01:07:59,900
It's hard to find him

945
01:08:01,572 --> 01:08:02,104
What?

946
01:08:02,752 --> 01:08:06,408
Ishizuka?
There's no such a police

947
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:10,307
Hello, this is Ishizuka.

948
01:08:11,150 --> 01:08:11,939
It's me

949
01:08:12,861 --> 01:08:13,533
You

950
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:20,580
I miss you.
I've been having second thoughts.

951
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:25,716
Tonight at 10:00, I want you to meet me at the backstage door.

952
01:10:24,957 --> 01:10:25,753
I'm looking around

953
01:10:43,733 --> 01:10:45,101
Thanks for coming

954
01:10:45,210 --> 01:10:46,749
I'm glad you reconsidered.

955
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,116
You beat me to it.

956
01:10:49,296 --> 01:10:50,077
I saw you dance.

957
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:51,929
How was it?

958
01:10:52,124 --> 01:10:55,132
You're not a good dancer, but you have a good body.
You make me want to marry you.

959
01:10:55,601 --> 01:10:56,444
You're an idiot.

960
01:10:56,749 --> 01:10:57,874
You'd make a great wife.

961
01:10:58,694 --> 01:11:00,140
That's ridiculous

962
01:11:02,061 --> 01:11:03,311
What can I do for you?

963
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:07,194
How much will you give me if I talk?

964
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:08,476
Deal?

965
01:11:09,577 --> 01:11:13,015
That's right.
I have to get out of town.

966
01:11:13,671 --> 01:11:15,452
And the best way to do that is with money.

967
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:19,015
It's okay, my company is big and the economy is booming.

968
01:11:19,179 --> 01:11:19,991
Are you OK?

969
01:11:20,491 --> 01:11:21,624
What's wrong?

970
01:11:21,757 --> 01:11:23,046
Get out from here!

971
01:11:37,389 --> 01:11:40,061
I told you to stay away from this woman.

972
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:42,866
I forgot.

973
01:11:44,194 --> 01:11:46,108
I'll make sure you don't.

974
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:55,787
Look at how he get punished

975
01:11:56,303 --> 01:11:59,694
It's better than your dancing

976
01:12:01,631 --> 01:12:03,045
First, I'll do a spell.

977
01:12:05,459 --> 01:12:07,717
We'll fool the police.

978
01:12:13,197 --> 01:12:16,557
Don't waste your beer
You don't even make enough money.

979
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:23,580
You've got panache.

980
01:12:28,909 --> 01:12:31,080
Try it again

981
01:12:35,701 --> 01:12:39,177
Serves you right.
Your jacket got dirty

982
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:53,686
What do you think?

983
01:12:54,998 --> 01:12:56,045
That's funny.

984
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,904
Beat him. someone might come

985
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:19,404
Take care of her
We don't want any mess around here, do we?

986
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:25,574
Who?

987
01:14:26,883 --> 01:14:29,375
It's me,Motomi

988
01:14:34,969 --> 01:14:35,844
What do you want?

989
01:14:37,625 --> 01:14:39,516
I want to apologize.

990
01:14:40,594 --> 01:14:41,477
You don't need

991
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:45,149
It's ok

992
01:14:47,445 --> 01:14:48,140
Open the door

993
01:14:48,633 --> 01:14:49,203
Are you alone?

994
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:50,328
Yes

995
01:14:50,758 --> 01:14:51,531
Really?

996
01:14:51,726 --> 01:14:53,109
Open the door

997
01:14:58,836 --> 01:14:59,836
What do you want?

998
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,515
Are you ok?

999
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:05,055
I was tricked

1000
01:15:07,976 --> 01:15:09,414
Kakegawa threatened me.

1001
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,383
My bad

1002
01:15:15,078 --> 01:15:17,797
It can't be helped..

1003
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,534
Lie down.
Shall I lay out a futon for you? No, I'll patch you up.

1004
01:15:25,559 --> 01:15:26,479
You don't need

1005
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:32,260
Let me help you.
I used to be a nurse.

1006
01:15:33,104 --> 01:15:35,081
How did you end up as a stripper?

1007
01:15:36,495 --> 01:15:38,862
The doctors tricked me. They threw me away.

1008
01:15:39,276 --> 01:15:40,917
It's like something out of a novel.

1009
01:15:41,229 --> 01:15:42,018
Yeah

1010
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,018
Take off your jacket

1011
01:15:46,043 --> 01:15:48,471
I'm not so badly hurt, am I?

1012
01:15:52,628 --> 01:15:56,214
Next time Kakegawa comes around, you'll get your ass handed to you.

1013
01:15:56,854 --> 01:15:58,089
I see

1014
01:16:00,284 --> 01:16:03,167
I'm sure Kakegawa will take you out again.

1015
01:16:04,503 --> 01:16:05,721
I see

1016
01:16:09,135 --> 01:16:11,612
I'm going home.
I hope you're feeling better soon.

1017
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:18,877
You too.

1018
01:16:20,510 --> 01:16:23,244
I should stay here?

1019
01:16:23,713 --> 01:16:25,064
Up to you

1020
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,292
I wanna be here

1021
01:16:29,925 --> 01:16:33,284
You miss having a man around at night?

1022
01:16:34,292 --> 01:16:35,230
I'm going home.

1023
01:16:35,495 --> 01:16:36,277
Up to you

1024
01:16:42,308 --> 01:16:45,206
I'll tell you everything and

1025
01:16:45,441 --> 01:16:47,448
I know, money right?

1026
01:16:49,941 --> 01:16:52,503
No.
Let me stay here

1027
01:16:53,558 --> 01:16:54,402
Why?

1028
01:16:56,652 --> 01:17:01,878
I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow if I talk to you.
That's why I'd like to spend just tonight by your side.

1029
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:05,363
I'm having so much fun being around you.

1030
01:17:09,229 --> 01:17:14,408
I've never had a good time with you before.
And I don't think I ever will.

1031
01:17:16,862 --> 01:17:18,276
So just tonight.

1032
01:17:21,002 --> 01:17:24,635
You can stay as long as you want.

1033
01:17:26,705 --> 01:17:27,354
Really?

1034
01:17:29,596 --> 01:17:31,143
I want you to stay, too.

1035
01:17:38,036 --> 01:17:43,677
You were right, it was that hit man with the scars who took out Akiko.

1036
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:44,606
That's what I thought

1037
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:49,520
That's not all.
The night before that, Hirose came to see her

1038
01:17:49,825 --> 01:17:50,505
Hirose?

1039
01:17:50,958 --> 01:17:54,294
That's right.
Yes, he wanted to give Akiko a job.

1040
01:17:54,856 --> 01:17:55,825
job?

1041
01:17:57,121 --> 01:17:59,371
Bring Mr. Ochiai to the hotel.

1042
01:18:01,011 --> 01:18:02,581
You're a good girl after all.

1043
01:18:10,446 --> 01:18:11,548
There's more.

1044
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:18,954
Akiko left her notebook.
If she die, she wants me to report it to the police.

1045
01:18:19,641 --> 01:18:21,790
But I was too scared to go.

1046
01:18:25,571 --> 01:18:28,204
Looks like it has a congressman's name on it.

1047
01:18:28,493 --> 01:18:31,868
This is awesome.
It's got everyone involved with the U.S. military camp payments.

1048
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:40,345
I could die in here.

1049
01:18:51,921 --> 01:18:55,858
With your testimony and this notebook, we can take down HIROSE.

1050
01:18:57,655 --> 01:18:59,303
Mr. Takazawa must be pleased.

1051
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:03,647
I'll wait here alone?

1052
01:19:04,007 --> 01:19:04,585
I'll be right back.

1053
01:19:12,745 --> 01:19:13,581
Don't leave the room.

1054
01:19:51,228 --> 01:19:53,049
That's a great of a thing to do.

1055
01:19:53,486 --> 01:19:58,751
We'll definitely win.
Let's write an article on all of them.
Let's destroy HIROSE.

1056
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:05,838
We have evidence, we have witnesses, and now it's not just speculation.

1057
01:20:08,424 --> 01:20:10,322
Let's go to our office

1058
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:31,021
Ishizuka found all the evidence.

1059
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:34,631
What are you going to do,Hirose?
Where is Ishizuka?

1060
01:20:36,748 --> 01:20:39,912
I don't know.
You promised not to touch Ishizuka.

1061
01:20:41,342 --> 01:20:46,545
You don't tell me what to do.All you have to do is let me know.
Just like you did at the photo studio.

1062
01:20:47,334 --> 01:20:48,029
where he is?

1063
01:20:48,951 --> 01:20:49,607
I don't know

1064
01:20:51,256 --> 01:20:54,131
Ok, so I'll leave it to you

1065
01:20:58,334 --> 01:20:59,006
Director

1066
01:21:01,975 --> 01:21:02,639
What?

1067
01:21:03,373 --> 01:21:04,764
You are the spy?

1068
01:21:06,748 --> 01:21:07,459
Oh, yeah.

1069
01:21:07,498 --> 01:21:08,764
You were working for a murderer.

1070
01:21:09,537 --> 01:21:11,209
Hirose did it

1071
01:21:11,318 --> 01:21:13,264
It's the same thing.

1072
01:21:17,287 --> 01:21:19,138
I wanted to help you.

1073
01:21:20,373 --> 01:21:23,373
You told me about the hit man when Officer Katayama told me.

1074
01:21:24,177 --> 01:21:27,068
Hirose had you in his sights from that moment on.

1075
01:21:27,404 --> 01:21:31,099
You killed two innocent people to save me?

1076
01:21:31,756 --> 01:21:33,365
Don't be exciting

1077
01:21:35,935 --> 01:21:39,287
I was an idiot.
You believed in me.

1078
01:21:40,013 --> 01:21:43,466
You taught me how to do my job.
and I tried my best to emulate you.

1079
01:21:44,138 --> 01:21:45,709
You tricked me

1080
01:21:47,162 --> 01:21:49,740
You knew everything.

1081
01:21:50,545 --> 01:21:53,787
If you'd wanted to, you could've crushed Hirose.
Why didn't you?

1082
01:21:54,795 --> 01:21:57,123
For some reasons.

1083
01:21:57,607 --> 01:21:59,076
You didn't want to die.

1084
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:04,084
I've been working hard

1085
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,006
So you wanted money?
Money for drinks at the bar.

1086
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:11,935
I can't drink much with half a stomach.
Calm down.

1087
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:15,076
No way.
I'm so upset

1088
01:22:15,654 --> 01:22:18,701
Director's a spy.
That's funny

1089
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:22,849
I'm quitting the company.
I don't want to work for you anymore.

1090
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,789
Where's motomi?
You want to kill MOTOMI too?

1091
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:38,657
No, I don't know. I never know.
You just have to trust me on this.

1092
01:23:39,813 --> 01:23:42,727
Don't hang up, Ishizuka

1093
01:23:49,919 --> 01:23:51,872
Come out!

1094
01:23:52,013 --> 01:23:53,208
I know

1095
01:23:55,044 --> 01:23:56,497
What's the hell?

1096
01:23:57,872 --> 01:23:59,309
Where's Kakegawa?

1097
01:24:07,302 --> 01:24:08,223
Say

1098
01:24:19,911 --> 01:24:20,966
You

1099
01:24:21,731 --> 01:24:24,598
You're getting yourself half killed again?

1100
01:24:25,075 --> 01:24:26,606
I want to talk to you alone.

1101
01:24:27,348 --> 01:24:28,817
What?

1102
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:31,606
You're scared of me?

1103
01:24:32,981 --> 01:24:35,067
I'm scared of you?

1104
01:24:37,216 --> 01:24:38,630
That's funny

1105
01:24:47,921 --> 01:24:48,882
What's the hell?

1106
01:24:57,112 --> 01:24:58,518
What do you want to talk about?

1107
01:24:59,502 --> 01:25:00,963
Akiko was pregnant.

1108
01:25:05,158 --> 01:25:05,799
What?

1109
01:25:06,463 --> 01:25:08,697
Five months pregnant.
Your baby.

1110
01:25:11,381 --> 01:25:14,318
Don't say Bullshit.

1111
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:18,467
That's why Akiko didn't want to see Ochiai.
Guess who forced her to see him?

1112
01:25:19,092 --> 01:25:21,037
Your boss,Hirose

1113
01:25:23,357 --> 01:25:25,560
Don't say Bullshit.

1114
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,615
Who took her to the hotel by force? The hit man.

1115
01:25:32,584 --> 01:25:34,248
You’re lair

1116
01:25:38,310 --> 01:25:41,381
Ask Motomi.
She knows everything

1117
01:25:43,342 --> 01:25:44,638
How's her?

1118
01:25:45,021 --> 01:25:47,459
I made her sleep

1119
01:25:47,560 --> 01:25:53,349
I'm about to give her some pills.
If I put this much in her, she'll be dead in a heartbeat.

1120
01:25:54,139 --> 01:25:55,304
Boss's order?

1121
01:25:55,538 --> 01:26:01,006
Of course not.
If we sell this off, we're looking at 300,000 in cash.

1122
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:09,304
Stay strong

1123
01:26:12,905 --> 01:26:15,960
Do you understand me?

1124
01:26:19,421 --> 01:26:21,992
Akiko was pregnant?

1125
01:26:25,085 --> 01:26:27,898
She didn't say anything to me.

1126
01:26:30,232 --> 01:26:33,537
You said, "I don't want a baby, put it down.

1127
01:26:36,146 --> 01:26:40,459
But Akiko wanted to see your baby.

1128
01:26:42,694 --> 01:26:43,835
Damn it

1129
01:26:45,108 --> 01:26:49,249
She'd also been saving up for a baby and she'd need the money.

1130
01:27:03,296 --> 01:27:05,272
I don't know what will happen to you

1131
01:27:05,741 --> 01:27:06,585
Shut up

1132
01:27:13,585 --> 01:27:14,616
Where are you going?

1133
01:27:15,514 --> 01:27:17,451
To visit my wife's grave.

1134
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:32,069
Are you okay?

1135
01:27:32,890 --> 01:27:33,538
I'm fine.

1136
01:27:34,898 --> 01:27:37,233
I told you I don't care when I die.

1137
01:27:38,273 --> 01:27:42,710
I don't want to die.
The only thing I have to look forward to anymore is living with you.

1138
01:27:44,929 --> 01:27:45,905
How's your newspaper?

1139
01:27:46,687 --> 01:27:47,726
I hate the newspaper

1140
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:50,843
Let's go somewhere far away.

1141
01:27:58,347 --> 01:28:00,012
The president wants to see you.

1142
01:28:00,246 --> 01:28:02,715
The president?Ishizuka has not come yet

1143
01:28:03,199 --> 01:28:05,027
I haven't heard from him since this morning.

1144
01:28:05,269 --> 01:28:05,887
I see

1145
01:28:15,520 --> 01:28:16,592
Takasawa,something goes wrong

1146
01:28:16,795 --> 01:28:17,311
What's wrong?

1147
01:28:19,443 --> 01:28:24,162
Half the newspaper dealers in the city have refused to carry our paper from next month.

1148
01:28:24,787 --> 01:28:27,482
Hirose was finally seduced by TOTO.

1149
01:28:27,982 --> 01:28:28,756
Hirose ?

1150
01:28:32,881 --> 01:28:34,904
Hirose took a lot of money from them

1151
01:28:35,029 --> 01:28:39,529
That's not all.
Hirose isn't happy with the way you're handling the post

1152
01:28:40,424 --> 01:28:45,010
He makes it clear that he doesn't like the way you're letting young reporters run wild.

1153
01:28:47,245 --> 01:28:52,456
I trust you.
I'm trusting you because I trust you.

1154
01:28:54,354 --> 01:28:58,472
But you know what?
We must sell newspaper

1155
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,940
It's a shame that TOTO is taking advantage of us.

1156
01:29:03,393 --> 01:29:06,425
Can't you do something about the article?

1157
01:29:14,901 --> 01:29:16,190
I wanna swim

1158
01:29:16,448 --> 01:29:17,268
It's too cold

1159
01:29:17,932 --> 01:29:23,464
I'm fine.
When I was a kid, about this time, I used to go in the ocean to pick up shells.

1160
01:29:27,534 --> 01:29:28,823
You look sad

1161
01:29:29,362 --> 01:29:30,370
Must be the sunset.

1162
01:29:32,167 --> 01:29:35,409
I knew you'd think about newspaper

1163
01:29:36,339 --> 01:29:41,393
Don't talk to me about newspapers.
I don't care what happens to a newspaper that's sold its soul to the bad guys.

1164
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:52,268
I say the same thing over and over again.
I wonder if there is any way to come up with an idea that will bring about a comeback

1165
01:29:52,893 --> 01:29:57,675
With TOTO and HIROSE as enemies
This is like going to war with the US and the Soviet Union.

1166
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,448
There's nothing we can do.

1167
01:30:04,651 --> 01:30:07,925
Let's get it on.
Mr. President, don't worry.

1168
01:30:08,589 --> 01:30:12,034
I've never lost a game.

1169
01:30:17,659 --> 01:30:19,042
Beer

1170
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:21,800
You can drink

1171
01:30:22,511 --> 01:30:23,628
It was hard work.

1172
01:30:27,604 --> 01:30:30,198
But a woman's happiness is so simple.

1173
01:30:30,807 --> 01:30:36,776
Marry the man you love.
Live in the same house, have children.

1174
01:30:38,143 --> 01:30:41,597
But I can't seem to find him.

1175
01:30:42,909 --> 01:30:44,057
Well, here he is.

1176
01:30:45,831 --> 01:30:47,651
Every guys said so

1177
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:49,417
You think I'm lying?

1178
01:30:50,292 --> 01:30:54,503
I don't care if it's a lie.
I'm dirty anyway.

1179
01:30:55,667 --> 01:31:00,018
Don't worry.
We're all dirty.

1180
01:31:09,925 --> 01:31:11,175
I'm getting sleepy.

1181
01:31:13,362 --> 01:31:14,909
Bill please

1182
01:31:15,745 --> 01:31:17,206
370yen

1183
01:31:17,893 --> 01:31:20,682
I knew you liked newspapers.

1184
01:31:20,761 --> 01:31:25,932
No, I don't.
I'd like to beat the director to a pulp.

1185
01:31:28,761 --> 01:31:30,245
Thanks

1186
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:33,589
Is everyone here?

1187
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:35,347
Where's Ishizuka?

1188
01:31:35,526 --> 01:31:38,026
We're looking for him

1189
01:31:43,586 --> 01:31:45,336
There's still time for the morning paper.

1190
01:31:54,485 --> 01:31:55,977
Listen

1191
01:31:59,133 --> 01:32:00,602
I don't have much time, so I'll make it simple.

1192
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:08,703
I'm here to keep this paper afloat.
I've been holding hands with the BOSS.

1193
01:32:10,422 --> 01:32:13,406
And that BOSS is Hirose.

1194
01:32:15,711 --> 01:32:16,524
Hirose?

1195
01:32:19,172 --> 01:32:28,070
When I came from Tokyo to be the editor-in-chief of this newspaper.
This was still a third-rate newspaper.

1196
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:32,977
My job was to turn this place into the premier local newspaper.

1197
01:32:34,250 --> 01:32:35,055
I needed money

1198
01:32:36,070 --> 01:32:40,289
But banks were not yet willing to lend money.

1199
01:32:41,664 --> 01:32:46,922
So the first thing I did was to train the best people and pull them out.

1200
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:53,039
You also pulled them out from other newspapers with a 30% monthly salary increase.

1201
01:32:57,391 --> 01:33:02,336
Expand the sales network.

1202
01:33:03,617 --> 01:33:05,352
No matter how much money we had, it was never enough.

1203
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,555
That's when I hooked up with HIROSE.

1204
01:33:09,742 --> 01:33:14,195
I used his money
And through his dealers, I made inroads into the rest of the world.

1205
01:33:15,297 --> 01:33:21,688
Seibu Shinbun is now a first-rate local newspaper that can even compete with Chuo Shinbun.

1206
01:33:22,492 --> 01:33:27,383
I hooked up with the bad guys for the paper.
I don't have a choice.

1207
01:33:27,992 --> 01:33:28,672
Director

1208
01:33:29,188 --> 01:33:30,859
I didn't have a choice.

1209
01:33:32,742 --> 01:33:37,000
In a country like this, you have to live first, even if you have to push people away

1210
01:33:38,609 --> 01:33:41,539
Justice and morality don't mean a thing.

1211
01:33:41,992 --> 01:33:44,227
We should stay strong

1212
01:33:47,234 --> 01:33:54,070
Fortunately or unfortunately...
When the election started, the stripper case against Ochiai came up.

1213
01:33:55,406 --> 01:33:57,219
HIROSE is behind it.

1214
01:33:58,938 --> 01:33:59,859


1215
01:34:00,258 --> 01:34:03,328
So you're telling us not to write?

1216
01:34:03,578 --> 01:34:04,477
Wait

1217
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,898
Don't be fooled!

1218
01:34:08,422 --> 01:34:10,430
I've been waiting for you

1219
01:34:13,453 --> 01:34:15,117
He's Hirose's spy.

1220
01:34:16,172 --> 01:34:18,828
He's the one who broke every lead I had.

1221
01:34:19,539 --> 01:34:21,156
And a few people died because of it.

1222
01:34:21,633 --> 01:34:24,344
Katayama, the cop.
The photographer from the hot spring resort.

1223
01:34:25,156 --> 01:34:29,852
You're the one who nailed us for writing a speculative story, and you're the one who fudged the truth.

1224
01:34:30,633 --> 01:34:31,172
Really?

1225
01:34:32,063 --> 01:34:32,961
That's true

1226
01:34:34,484 --> 01:34:36,016
Ishizuka's right

1227
01:34:38,695 --> 01:34:41,742
I've been waiting for you

1228
01:34:43,031 --> 01:34:46,742
I want you to write me a full report on every case you look into right now.

1229
01:34:48,008 --> 01:34:49,617
You guys split up the details of the post

1230
01:34:50,680 --> 01:34:52,367
You write the main story, and you write it thick and fast.

1231
01:34:53,516 --> 01:34:55,961
If I write it, I'll beat you to death, too.

1232
01:34:56,461 --> 01:35:01,070
You can write "murderer," "spy," whatever you want.

1233
01:35:03,602 --> 01:35:05,945
You still look like you don't believe me.

1234
01:35:07,203 --> 01:35:11,094
Call HiRose.
Now's the time I'll clearly cut him off in front of everyone.

1235
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:21,375
Hirose Transport?
Mr. President, please.

1236
01:35:25,398 --> 01:35:27,961
Mr. President?
Our Director wanna talk to you

1237
01:35:38,594 --> 01:35:41,617
Good evening. How are you?

1238
01:35:43,172 --> 01:35:44,352
Did you hear from the President?

1239
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,812
Look in tomorrow morning's paper.

1240
01:35:47,516 --> 01:35:49,703
Your picture will be in the papers, loud and clear.

1241
01:35:51,117 --> 01:35:52,531
Are you trying to fuck with me?

1242
01:35:53,047 --> 01:35:58,445
Stripper killings, corruption in U.S. military camps.
It says everything about you.

1243
01:35:59,547 --> 01:36:01,914
Everyone can even see the number of blacks on your back.

1244
01:36:03,852 --> 01:36:05,609
What are you doing?

1245
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:07,781
Don't get upset

1246
01:36:09,211 --> 01:36:13,922
I like newspapers after all.
You're in the way.

1247
01:36:16,805 --> 01:36:19,188
Anyway, I'm thinking of letting him walk around on her own tomorrow.

1248
01:36:21,078 --> 01:36:24,703
We'll beat you for starters.
We gonna take out the biggest boss in this area.

1249
01:36:26,297 --> 01:36:29,500
Our news value is full marks!
I'm sure sales will go up a lot tomorrow.

1250
01:36:34,539 --> 01:36:35,805
Is that all you have to say?

1251
01:36:36,070 --> 01:36:37,656
Tomorrow, this town will be reborn.

1252
01:36:38,180 --> 01:36:42,375
Ochiai will be released.
No wonder he's getting all the sympathy he deserves.

1253
01:36:42,805 --> 01:36:46,578
Our newspaper will finally grow together with this revolutionary politician.

1254
01:36:48,453 --> 01:36:51,602
At the very least, you should give TOTO some love.

1255
01:36:51,742 --> 01:36:53,813
You think you can get away with that?

1256
01:36:54,438 --> 01:36:57,469
You and I are going to have to get along.

1257
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:08,672
How was it?

1258
01:37:09,477 --> 01:37:10,500
Let's get it on

1259
01:37:11,156 --> 01:37:13,094
Two hours to go before the morning paper's deadline.

1260
01:37:14,039 --> 01:37:17,852
Show Hirose and TOTO News the power of the SEIBU newspaper.

1261
01:37:21,906 --> 01:37:23,398
I'm counting on you

1262
01:37:26,063 --> 01:37:28,055
Let's do it!

1263
01:37:35,329 --> 01:37:38,595
Ok.Let's go, guys!

1264
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,359
This is a memo I've been working on for years.

1265
01:37:48,430 --> 01:37:50,359
It's got every bad thing Hirose did.

1266
01:37:51,734 --> 01:37:54,461
Use this one, too, and write as much as you can.

1267
01:38:00,742 --> 01:38:03,555
Ishizuka, you're finally the second generation.

1268
01:38:04,461 --> 01:38:06,789
Definitely my second generation.
That's great!

1269
01:38:09,133 --> 01:38:14,133
But don't become a gangster like me.
Don't be a philistine.Don't get dirty.

1270
01:38:15,117 --> 01:38:18,930
Be more outraged at the injustice in the world

1271
01:38:22,375 --> 01:38:22,969
Director

1272
01:38:23,094 --> 01:38:23,852
Don't say a word.

1273
01:38:27,196 --> 01:38:29,758
Come on, we're running out of time.
Start writing.

1274
01:38:31,555 --> 01:38:32,250
Director

1275
01:38:44,933 --> 01:38:45,792
You

1276
01:39:42,425 --> 01:39:45,379
Can I get a light?

1277
01:40:46,728 --> 01:40:48,353
Hey

1278
01:40:49,494 --> 01:40:52,556
five more minutes, whether you're crying or laughing.

1279
01:40:54,017 --> 01:40:56,134
It's time for the birthday of the regular morning paper.

1280
01:40:57,549 --> 01:40:58,908
Hello, this is Seibu newspaper

1281
01:41:02,463 --> 01:41:03,197
Eh?

1282
01:41:04,439 --> 01:41:05,197
What's wrong?

1283
01:41:06,306 --> 01:41:09,377
Our director was killed by a hit man

1284
01:41:19,651 --> 01:41:20,354
Wait

1285
01:41:22,526 --> 01:41:24,472
Newspapers have to meet deadlines.

1286
01:41:25,472 --> 01:41:27,339
They don't wait for us on deadline.

1287
01:41:28,245 --> 01:41:29,917
We can offer incense anytime we want.

1288
01:41:40,932 --> 01:41:41,815
Let's do it!

2
00:00:13,844 --> 00:00:16,133
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen

3
00:00:16,158 --> 00:00:17,821
Good morning

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,429
Welcome

5
00:00:19,454 --> 00:00:20,657
Welcome

6
00:00:20,682 --> 00:00:25,789
Thank you for visiting our store while you are busy.

7
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:30,602
Today is the opening special sale!

8
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:36,016
Short-sleeved T-shirts are discounted to 100 yen instead of 1500 yen

9
00:00:36,766 --> 00:00:41,141
Original blouse 1500 yen will be discounted to 100 yen

10
00:00:43,149 --> 00:00:51,672
Black trademark

11
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:55,117
Domestic rayon is a good idea

12
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:58,078
It's just the letter i and n are different.

13
00:00:59,055 --> 00:01:01,149
Trademark design is the same as ours

14
00:01:01,305 --> 00:01:01,657
Yes

15
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:05,758
This is clearly a conscious counterfeit using our credit,Boss

16
00:01:06,156 --> 00:01:06,640
Um

17
00:01:07,227 --> 00:01:07,985
Ide-kun

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,555
Were there many shirts with this fake trademark?

19
00:01:11,133 --> 00:01:15,336
Out of the ten dozen items that that store purchased, only three have counterfeit marks.

20
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:20,438
But they're making these labels, so I think we're going to see more counterfeiting

21
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:21,750
Boss

22
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:24,055
This will be our credit problem

23
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:26,508
Eventually we may go bankrupt

24
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:27,320
Um

25
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:30,539
But to find the culprit of this counterfeit label

26
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:33,172
We have to find out the supplier

27
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:34,016
Yes

28
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:36,149
For the time being, the supplier...

29
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,305
I went to a cash wholesaler called Marusho near Yokoyama Town

30
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,782
The subcontract manufacturer of this shirt is a new company of Owari Ichinomiya

31
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:48,602
They seem to be struggling with cash flow these days

32
00:01:49,461 --> 00:01:51,883
Then the manufacturer is suspicious

33
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:55,414
Or it could be a wholesaler dealing with it.

34
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:57,250
I also checked the wholesaler

35
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,602
The wholesaler is in Nagoya

36
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,242
Um

37
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:03,321
Ide-kun

38
00:02:03,883 --> 00:02:08,492
I know it's a lot to ask, but can you please go to Nagoya and find out what's really going on?

39
00:02:09,985 --> 00:02:10,266
Yes

40
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:12,657
You're going into detail.

41
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,500
You've got three days to figure it out.

42
00:02:15,187 --> 00:02:15,562
Yes

43
00:02:16,477 --> 00:02:17,789
I'm going now

44
00:03:40,602 --> 00:03:41,594
What's the matter?

45
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:44,274
You are Mr. Ide from International Rayon, right?

46
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:46,664
Yes

47
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:49,953
Uww!

48
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:39,242
Ah, Sugino-san

49
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,125
It seems that the criminal who killed Mr. Ide self-confessed

50
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:42,063
I know it

51
00:04:45,547 --> 00:04:46,117
Come in

52
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,696
What's the matter?

53
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:50,398
Yes

54
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,352
Actually, I just found out at the cash wholesaler, Marusho.

55
00:04:57,313 --> 00:05:01,117
The fake label was depressed by a man named Kakiuchi, a broker in Osaka.

56
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:05,844
So I go to Osaka and look up the man named Kakiuchi.

57
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:10,375
So we can see the truth about the counterfeit label and the true criminal who killed Mr. Ide.

58
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,664
You read the newspaper,right?

59
00:05:13,172 --> 00:05:16,907
The criminal who killed Mr. Ide says he was already caught and confessed to aim for his wallet.

60
00:05:17,782 --> 00:05:19,946
Don't get confused

61
00:05:20,164 --> 00:05:22,336
No...This confession is an excuse

62
00:05:23,883 --> 00:05:26,836
His target was Ms. Ide's treasured notebook.

63
00:05:27,696 --> 00:05:29,821
Our trade secret was written in the notebook

64
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,492
I think he was just targeted by a thief

65
00:05:33,172 --> 00:05:36,305
Simply put, he was unlucky.

66
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:40,805
Then you don't think that Mr. Ichigo was a line of duty?

67
00:05:41,492 --> 00:05:43,969
The business trip order I issued was to Nagoya

68
00:05:44,758 --> 00:05:45,578
Not to Osaka

69
00:05:45,797 --> 00:05:49,672
So you are going to treat Mr. Ide's death as an accidental death?

70
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:50,414
Sugino-kun

71
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:52,000
Boss

72
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,328
Mr. Ide noticed something in Nagoya and went to Osaka to investigate.

73
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:59,883
That would mean he was killed in the line of duty.

74
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,102
It might be so

75
00:06:01,688 --> 00:06:03,735
But we have work rules

76
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:08,102
I can't understand why he didn't contact me

77
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:10,836
I'm sorry for that now

78
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:13,907
I see

79
00:06:14,953 --> 00:06:15,321
Boss

80
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:19,297
Then please allow me to be absent from illness for half a month

81
00:06:20,086 --> 00:06:21,602
What do you do when you are absent?

82
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:23,446
I go to Osaka

83
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:24,164
Sugino-kun

84
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:25,922
Don't say such a selfish thing

85
00:06:26,532 --> 00:06:29,336
We decided to leave the fake label to the police

86
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,875
I can't give you permission

87
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,430
I want to take paid vacation

88
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:34,485
How many days?

89
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:36,157
All five days I have

90
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:36,969
Five days?

91
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:38,414
Fair enough

92
00:06:38,805 --> 00:06:40,516
But I won't accept any more absences.

93
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:42,351
I know that

94
00:06:57,063 --> 00:06:59,422
Sister,I hate the director's guts.

95
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,266
He is not motivated

96
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,852
He is retired in two years

97
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,407
He is now competing for an executive position with the promotion manager

98
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,516
So Ide's case

99
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:14,032
He doesn't want Mr. Ide's death to be a line of duty on a business trip

100
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:19,437
They have to pay for the line of duty

101
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,414
He'll be accused of sending him on a dangerous business trip.

102
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:24,797
I see

103
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:27,328
You're not dangerous?

104
00:07:27,899 --> 00:07:30,758
Mr. Ide has a wife and three children

105
00:07:31,813 --> 00:07:38,492
I don't think it's a good idea for those four to put up with only a small amount of processing money without getting martyrdom pay.

106
00:07:41,235 --> 00:07:44,563
So I go to Osaka to find out the truth

107
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:50,516
I'm sorry, but I need to borrow some money. I'm on a payday loan.

108
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:54,312
We don't have money either because we paid the wholesaler

109
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,321
30,000 yen or 20,000 yen is fine

110
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,657
It ’s expensive to stay at an inn, right?

111
00:07:58,682 --> 00:07:59,547
Don't worry about that

112
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,899
My friend from college, JINGO, is in Osaka, so I'll be staying there. He work for textile wholesaler

113
00:08:03,641 --> 00:08:06,399
Ok..so...20000yen is fine?

114
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:07,664
Thank you

115
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:17,273
OSAKA

116
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:38,797
Excuse me, where is the president?

117
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:45,235
Oh! you!... a top employee of a top company.

118
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,953
I see.
Counterfeit International Rayon labels....

119
00:08:50,547 --> 00:08:51,430
Looks interesting

120
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,110
I will lend you wisdom

121
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:56,211
I will not lend you money and accommodation

122
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:58,953
Can I get a cigarette?

123
00:08:59,024 --> 00:09:01,078
Yes you can.
It's a catio

124
00:09:01,766 --> 00:09:03,367
I like this cheap cigarette,Ikoi

125
00:09:05,008 --> 00:09:07,930
Did you use that rayon for the shirt with this label?

126
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:09,664
What do you mean?

127
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:11,071
Actually

128
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Fujikane Shoji, an affiliate of your company near here

129
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:18,844
Around this spring, that rayon original fabric worth 20 million yen

130
00:09:19,305 --> 00:09:21,118
Was suspected of capture fraud

131
00:09:21,586 --> 00:09:21,993
I see

132
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:24,993
They are in the process of investigating it with the police

133
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:29,797
My guess is that it's not fraud, but diversion.

134
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:33,071
So Fujikane Shoji made fake shirts with the original fabric?

135
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:35,563
Well..I do not understand

136
00:09:36,407 --> 00:09:37,969
But you'd better do your research.

137
00:09:38,782 --> 00:09:42,524
The man responsible for the distribution of the raw materials is a small man named Shoji.

138
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,555
He may tell the truth

139
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:46,000
Shoji is the chief,right?

140
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,766
But you are familiar with Fujigane Shoji

141
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:50,664
What?

142
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,586
Of course

143
00:09:53,906 --> 00:09:55,797
That company is our competitor

144
00:09:57,016 --> 00:09:58,844
I am hiring a consultant

145
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,555
I'm familiar with that company

146
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:03,133
I see

147
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:04,578
Oh yeah

148
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,461
Would you like to introduce the consultant if you want to know more details?

149
00:10:08,414 --> 00:10:10,211
He is a strange person but has a lot of information

150
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:12,523
Thanks.
I may ask you later

151
00:10:17,148 --> 00:10:17,797
Excuse me

152
00:10:18,102 --> 00:10:20,719
Oh Yuki-san.
I was talking about your dad right now

153
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,070
I see

154
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,203
Yes this month's commission fee

155
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:32,555
Thank you

156
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:33,234
Thank you for your work

157
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:34,273
Excuse me

158
00:10:40,617 --> 00:10:42,750
Sugino,Where do you start your research?

159
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:46,344
Well...First of all, I will investigate from Fujigane Shoji

160
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,977
Then I should check the printer of this label

161
00:10:50,313 --> 00:10:52,031
Really? I appreciate it

162
00:10:52,922 --> 00:10:55,297
Oh..Fujigane's Shoji chief, right?

163
00:10:55,609 --> 00:10:56,328
Yes yes

164
00:10:58,156 --> 00:10:58,609
See you

165
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,125
Chief Shoji's in that garage.

166
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:07,453
Chief ?

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,617
He is there

168
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,555
Thank you

169
00:11:11,328 --> 00:11:13,500
Ah,I'm sorry to bother you suddenly

170
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:15,789
I'm Sugino from International Rayon

171
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:20,609
Actually, I would like to ask about a fake label T-shirt called domestic Tetron.

172
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:22,117
fake label?

173
00:11:22,305 --> 00:11:22,859
Yes

174
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:25,141
I don't know what are you talking about

175
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,172
I need to go now

176
00:11:28,492 --> 00:11:31,805
Well...Are you busy with 20 million yen and fraud?

177
00:11:34,242 --> 00:11:37,203
Would you like to talk while eating somewhere tonight?

178
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:39,672
Tonight?

179
00:11:39,922 --> 00:11:41,094
Yes, Where is good with you?

180
00:11:43,547 --> 00:11:44,547
Well....

181
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:49,063
Then how about a nightclub called Haril near Shinsaibashi?

182
00:11:50,047 --> 00:11:50,985
We can meet there around 8pm

183
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,485
Your friends won't come

184
00:12:12,242 --> 00:12:12,945
Maybe...

185
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,820
Welcome

186
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:21,110
Shoji-san

187
00:12:43,688 --> 00:12:46,742
What's wrong?
You look really serious

188
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,594
Will you come again ?

189
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:51,656
Yes

190
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,382
Yeah! I'm happy

191
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:55,672
My name is Akiko,
Please do not forget

192
00:12:56,789 --> 00:12:57,852
Promise me

193
00:13:52,805 --> 00:13:53,570
Excuse me

194
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,891
Oh, I was waiting for you

195
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,523
I just got a call from Jingo

196
00:13:58,953 --> 00:14:00,695
Please come in

197
00:14:05,406 --> 00:14:07,063
Please take your seat

198
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:10,414
Dad,he is here

199
00:14:19,242 --> 00:14:21,211
Nice to meet you, I ’m Sugino from International Rayon.

200
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:22,836
I'm Kazunori Tago

201
00:14:23,507 --> 00:14:25,710
I heard about most of it from Mr. Jingo

202
00:14:26,586 --> 00:14:28,031
You went to Fujigane

203
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:35,125
However, Fujigane Shoji's chief Shoji has died.

204
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:39,758
He closed the garage, started the engine and inhaled the exhaust gas

205
00:14:41,336 --> 00:14:43,469
He had a suicide note. So it ’s suicide, right?

206
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:49,235
So what do you want to ask me?

207
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:52,492
In short...With a fake label shirt

208
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:57,297
A man named Kakiuchi brought an international Tetoron shirt 30 darts to a cash wholesaler in Tokyo.

209
00:14:58,305 --> 00:15:00,141
I'm wondering if you know him...

210
00:15:00,852 --> 00:15:01,445
Kakiuchi...

211
00:15:01,688 --> 00:15:05,242
Yes..write "within" for the fence

212
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:09,703
I don't know

213
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,422
I see

214
00:15:11,531 --> 00:15:15,110
I only know information about product brokers in the Osaka area

215
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,039
I have no way to search it

216
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:18,836
There is a way

217
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:19,610
What?

218
00:15:19,938 --> 00:15:21,617
Better leave it to a specialist.

219
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:24,953
How about looking for a cash market?

220
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,375
Cash market?

221
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,266
You don't know?

222
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:31,094
Never mind

223
00:15:31,602 --> 00:15:32,086
Yukiko

224
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:33,930
Can you show him around?

225
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:38,820
I get a monthly allowance from Mr. Jingo

226
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,649
But not a lot of money

227
00:15:41,242 --> 00:15:43,719
If you have half a day, you can go all around

228
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:44,344
Yes

229
00:15:45,188 --> 00:15:47,078
I will get ready

230
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,774
Ah, thank you very much

231
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,297
No at all

232
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:57,570
Excuse me

233
00:15:57,703 --> 00:16:00,500
Oh..Look who it is. It's Mr. Tago' daughter.

234
00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:04,492
I'm looking for a person. Do you know a broker called Kakiuchi?

235
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:07,969
He bought an international Tetoron shirt half a month ago

236
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,125
I've never dealt with international tetron shirts.

237
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:22,352
Kakiuchi?

238
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,195
Yes

239
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:29,461
If that's the case, he's not the guy who came to stock the International Tetoron shirt, he's the guy who brought it here.

240
00:16:30,141 --> 00:16:30,851
He's the guy who brought it here?

241
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:36,070
10,000 copies of a 500 yen item for only 360 yen.

242
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:39,530
He brought it and hit it all in 3 minutes

243
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:41,500
He made a lot of money and went home

244
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:45,961
I see. He is here now?

245
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,444
Well.. I don't see him lately

246
00:16:49,444 --> 00:16:50,898
Do you know Mr. Kakiuchi's address?

247
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:53,258
Well...I don't know where he lives but

248
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,859
He often goes to Hime nightclubs

249
00:16:56,289 --> 00:16:56,734
Hime?

250
00:16:56,883 --> 00:16:57,375
Yes

251
00:16:57,867 --> 00:16:58,953
Is it near Shinsaibashi?

252
00:16:59,086 --> 00:16:59,469
Yes

253
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:03,250
You say you always come, but you don't

254
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:04,742
No way, I often come here

255
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:05,788
You are lying

256
00:17:05,914 --> 00:17:06,797
You are cold

257
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:07,578
Welcome

258
00:17:08,398 --> 00:17:09,453
Is a person called kakiuchi here?

259
00:17:09,562 --> 00:17:10,383
Yes, he is here

260
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,586
He is sitting at the counter

261
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,078
Please

262
00:17:15,156 --> 00:17:17,336
No no...I'm not very close to him

263
00:17:18,968 --> 00:17:19,960
Tell me who is he

264
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:20,680
Please

265
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:30,523
Hi! welcome!

266
00:17:39,164 --> 00:17:42,500
He's wearing that black suit and now drinking on-the-rock

267
00:17:43,382 --> 00:17:43,875
Thank you

268
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,422
Would you like some beers?

269
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,133
Yes

270
00:17:50,023 --> 00:17:52,164
He is a person with a strong eye

271
00:17:53,469 --> 00:17:54,492
Do not stare at him a lot

272
00:18:00,539 --> 00:18:01,469
He found us?

273
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,390
Don't worry.
He does not know us

274
00:18:07,234 --> 00:18:10,445
I'm assuming you're investigating him under orders from the Company.

275
00:18:11,586 --> 00:18:13,492
If so, I wouldn't do this kind of research.

276
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:17,976
I'm worried about money with you

277
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,670
Oh... I didn't know that

278
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,201
You can stay at my house if you like

279
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:28,451
What? well....but...

280
00:18:29,326 --> 00:18:31,412
I think my dad will be convinced when he hears that story

281
00:18:32,147 --> 00:18:35,373
My dad doesn't disagree with me

282
00:18:36,224 --> 00:18:38,076
I'm a little sorry about that.

283
00:18:38,139 --> 00:18:39,428
Never mind

284
00:18:41,389 --> 00:18:41,975
Oh...

285
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:43,420
Do not look back

286
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,131
There's a man from International Rayon here.

287
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:47,459
What will you do?

288
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,241
I will tell him our house

289
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:54,397
And while I'm at it, I can tell him about the counterfeit factory.

290
00:18:55,287 --> 00:18:57,318
Would you like to reveal the secret again?
You are a member of International Rayon.

291
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,420
Leave it to me

292
00:19:00,358 --> 00:19:01,366
I have a good idea, Let's go

293
00:19:09,584 --> 00:19:10,319
Let's get after him

294
00:19:10,344 --> 00:19:10,662
Yes

295
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,561
It's a strange car

296
00:19:22,147 --> 00:19:22,584
Yeah

297
00:19:23,459 --> 00:19:27,991
What's in that car?
It's not ice cream, and it's not bread.

298
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:08,631
Sorry, we found wrong house

299
00:20:09,561 --> 00:20:10,623
I'm not a suspicious person.

300
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,381
I am the Kakiuchi

301
00:20:13,186 --> 00:20:14,530
If you have something to do, say it clearly

302
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,178
I was so surprised.

303
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:24,748
I don't think it's safe to stake it out tomorrow morning.

304
00:20:25,201 --> 00:20:27,467
Don't worry, I'll make sure he doesn't find out next time.

305
00:21:45,045 --> 00:21:46,162
Excuse me.
Can I ask you something?

306
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:46,897
Yes

307
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,701
What are they making over there with a sewing machine?

308
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,381
They make shirts etc

309
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:52,084
They make shirts?

310
00:21:52,178 --> 00:21:52,912
Yes

311
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,561
They are subcontract factories

312
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,608
There is no nameplate, but what is their name?

313
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,076
Well...Before, there was a nameplate called Sakai Sales Office.

314
00:22:04,537 --> 00:22:05,365
Sakai Sales Office?

315
00:22:05,498 --> 00:22:06,162
Yes

316
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:11,709
Sakai Sales Office?

317
00:22:11,772 --> 00:22:12,115
Yes

318
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,865
It is a factory with 5 or 6 sewing machines.

319
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:19,213
It seems that Kakiuchi will come to stay at night

320
00:22:20,295 --> 00:22:23,280
I think that fake sports shirt was made at that factory.

321
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,123
It might be so

322
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:27,233
Actually

323
00:22:28,772 --> 00:22:30,967
There is a trading company called Mitsuya Shoji

324
00:22:32,014 --> 00:22:36,178
They've teamed up with a Hong Kong company before to do some smuggling.

325
00:22:37,772 --> 00:22:43,123
I think Fujigane Shoji gave the rayon to Mitsuya Shoji.

326
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:50,490
I think they're using that rayon to make fake sports shirts at the Sakai office.

327
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:54,186
I think the Sakai sales office has something to do with someone

328
00:22:54,701 --> 00:22:57,045
So that someone might be Kakiuchi

329
00:22:57,365 --> 00:22:59,764
No...He is a worse person

330
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:03,733
I know him...

331
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:07,248
They won't show any evidence.

332
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,373
I wish I could find the evidence...

333
00:23:13,709 --> 00:23:15,756
I can dispose of them at any time

334
00:23:20,186 --> 00:23:22,162
So who is him?

335
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,350
So That guy made that fake label

336
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:46,600
And Do you think he was the one who killed Mr. Ide?

337
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,014
It might be so

338
00:23:49,373 --> 00:23:51,561
I think He was the one who killed Shoji-san

339
00:23:51,748 --> 00:23:54,803
So Fujikane's Chief Shoji did not commit suicide.

340
00:23:54,889 --> 00:23:56,717
I think he was murdered.

341
00:23:58,303 --> 00:24:00,787
He cleverly pretended to be suicide

342
00:24:02,936 --> 00:24:05,842
You may also be targeted for life in the future

343
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:12,694
For them, aim at me before you

344
00:24:13,444 --> 00:24:15,037
I'm an obstacle to them

345
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,428
It was very hard to find this print shop

346
00:24:24,091 --> 00:24:25,435
Did you find them?
Where?

347
00:24:25,678 --> 00:24:28,951
It was a small printing shop in the back town of Kobe

348
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,295
Kobe?
You did good job

349
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,990
My wife's parents' house is doing printing related work

350
00:24:34,475 --> 00:24:35,967
They looked up from the type

351
00:24:37,873 --> 00:24:39,256
Hey! anyone there?

352
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,014
I'm here

353
00:24:40,123 --> 00:24:41,459
Bring simple juice

354
00:24:41,484 --> 00:24:42,912
What is simple juice?

355
00:24:43,006 --> 00:24:44,545
Of course, it is water

356
00:24:45,272 --> 00:24:47,748
So Did you know their ordered

357
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:51,530
So They didn't ask the name because it was a cash transaction

358
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,826
Please explain to me more about that printing shop.
I'll be there tomorrow.

359
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:56,709
I'll try to find clues

360
00:24:56,881 --> 00:24:59,990
Well...He's very tight-lipped.

361
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,530
But it's worth a visit

362
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:04,795
Yes, let's try

363
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,639
Sorry for keeping you wait

364
00:25:11,022 --> 00:25:11,709
How was it?

365
00:25:12,842 --> 00:25:14,944
Well...He was a stubborn person

366
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:20,935
The man who came to pick up the label came by the Osaka number car

367
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:23,569
And there was a big box on the loading platform, He said that

368
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,334
After all, the person who ordered the label was...

369
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:27,006
Yes

370
00:25:28,373 --> 00:25:29,803
He must be Kakiuchi

371
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:35,139
When this happens, I want to meet  Kakiuchi and talk about various things.

372
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:39,037
According to your father there is a worse person

373
00:25:41,694 --> 00:25:44,248
Do you have any idea?

374
00:25:45,530 --> 00:25:47,764
I think your father was unhappy because of him

375
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:53,084
My dad doesn't want to talk about those days

376
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:56,561
About those days?

377
00:25:57,092 --> 00:25:58,944
That was when I was still a kid.

378
00:26:00,569 --> 00:26:02,100
So I don't know well

379
00:26:03,092 --> 00:26:04,365
It was about 20 years ago

380
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:06,772
My dad ran a clothing company

381
00:26:08,427 --> 00:26:09,677
There was a bad person in the company

382
00:26:10,608 --> 00:26:11,584
He cheated on the books

383
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,834
He set the company on fire to deceive it

384
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:17,967
The company has all burned

385
00:26:19,365 --> 00:26:22,240
At that time,My mother and brother burned to death.

386
00:26:25,256 --> 00:26:26,405
I didn't know that happened.

387
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:32,131
So He set fire for the purpose of destroying evidence

388
00:26:32,334 --> 00:26:32,756
Yes

389
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:38,048
I ran away in the fire with my father

390
00:26:39,408 --> 00:26:43,923
I was crying for days when my mother and brother died

391
00:26:45,173 --> 00:26:46,501
I don't remember who he is.

392
00:26:47,681 --> 00:26:51,868
He started a business with the bad money

393
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:54,454
He seems to have succeeded

394
00:26:54,673 --> 00:26:55,525
Well...

395
00:26:55,994 --> 00:26:57,408
Was there a police interrogation?

396
00:26:58,392 --> 00:27:00,181
The police investigated many times

397
00:27:01,697 --> 00:27:04,173
But They said it was the reason for the electric leakage from the ceiling

398
00:27:05,337 --> 00:27:08,486
Since then my father's personality has changed

399
00:27:10,072 --> 00:27:10,783
I see

400
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:16,392
If my investigation is successful,
you will know the man who brought you all this misfortune.

401
00:27:17,962 --> 00:27:21,087
I've had my mind set on something ever since I can remember.

402
00:27:22,821 --> 00:27:25,813
I want to ease my father's suffering

403
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,470
Where has he gone?

404
00:28:08,993 --> 00:28:11,751
I think I'll be back soon.
He wrote only this

405
00:28:16,806 --> 00:28:18,845
Hello?
Yes I am

406
00:28:19,868 --> 00:28:21,165
What?
Telegram?

407
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:26,305
I see. Sorry, I was out

408
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:28,423
Yes please

409
00:28:29,743 --> 00:28:31,993
For survey...go to Kyushu

410
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:34,251
He'll be back in a few days

411
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:37,290
Yes I get it

412
00:28:38,274 --> 00:28:39,017
Where is the calling station

413
00:28:40,235 --> 00:28:40,977
Osaka

414
00:28:43,821 --> 00:28:46,095
I see. Thank you

415
00:28:48,618 --> 00:28:50,102
He was in a hurry

416
00:28:50,485 --> 00:28:52,665
It's odd that he would go so far away, to Kyushu.

417
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:54,329
Yes

418
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:58,399
But he went to Hokkaido last month

419
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,470
How did he get ready?

420
00:29:03,181 --> 00:29:05,977
My dad always carries the same bag when he goes on a trip

421
00:29:06,774 --> 00:29:08,540
He keeps everything he needs in that bag.

422
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,626
I'm sure he has brought the bag

423
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,360
I'm sure he left for what he thought would be a day trip.

424
00:29:28,673 --> 00:29:30,337
He suddenly decided to go to Kyushu

425
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:33,884
Yes..it might be so

426
00:29:44,548 --> 00:29:46,056
Ikue-san!
Oh, my God!

427
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:48,759
It seems Kakiuchi was dead

428
00:29:54,243 --> 00:29:55,876
What? Kakiuchi was dead?

429
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:57,063
Why?

430
00:29:57,470 --> 00:30:01,165
The factory burned around 1am and he died

431
00:30:01,993 --> 00:30:03,360
Details are written in the newspaper

432
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,798
Anyway I will go there

433
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:20,712
Hello? Who are you?

434
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:23,258
Oh sorry, I am person who concern

435
00:30:23,556 --> 00:30:25,774
I would like to ask about Mr. Kakiuchi who died.

436
00:30:25,931 --> 00:30:27,946
Please go to the investigation section of the main office

437
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:33,751
Yes,It was terrible

438
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:36,149
It was hard to dissect

439
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,032
Anyway He inhaled carbon monoxide

440
00:30:39,626 --> 00:30:43,282
There was no nitrogen in his belly

441
00:30:44,993 --> 00:30:46,915
After he committed suicide with gas

442
00:30:47,423 --> 00:30:50,743
The gas that filled the room ignited and became a fire

443
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:53,540
Well...Is there a possibility of setting fire?

444
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:54,563
Setting fire?

445
00:30:55,501 --> 00:30:59,681
He died two hours before the fire broke out

446
00:31:00,415 --> 00:31:02,227
Dead people don't set fire

447
00:31:02,407 --> 00:31:04,610
He didn't set the fire.

448
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:08,509
I mean, someone killed him then set fire

449
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:12,087
Given the circumstances, I don't see that as a possibility.

450
00:31:12,586 --> 00:31:15,461
Because it was all locked

451
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:21,352
I see.
I can't believe he commits suicide

452
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,048
You think so?

453
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:26,126
From what his wife told me, he wasn't doing so well at his job.

454
00:31:26,696 --> 00:31:27,063
His wife?

455
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,446
common-law marriage

456
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:30,009
Junko Hamanaka?

457
00:31:30,243 --> 00:31:30,813
Yes

458
00:31:31,532 --> 00:31:34,329
She recognized his dead body as soon as she saw it.

459
00:31:36,306 --> 00:31:38,712
She seems to be a dancer somewhere

460
00:31:40,321 --> 00:31:42,376
Ok...Thanks for having me

461
00:31:43,587 --> 00:31:44,118
See you

462
00:32:05,954 --> 00:32:07,196
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

463
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:08,587
Where is Ms.Hamanaka?

464
00:32:09,032 --> 00:32:09,985
Ms.Hamanaka?

465
00:32:10,251 --> 00:32:13,563
Yes,She lived here with a man named Kakiuchi lately

466
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:17,290
Well... I don't know. We have just moved here

467
00:32:17,446 --> 00:32:17,798
Right?

468
00:32:18,071 --> 00:32:18,774
All of you?

469
00:32:18,899 --> 00:32:20,587
Yes, this is our company dormitory

470
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:22,102
Your company dormitory?
Since when?

471
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:23,516
Since long time ago

472
00:32:25,524 --> 00:32:26,540
Car has arrived, let's go!

473
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:50,922
Super Ace is a big department store recently opened

474
00:32:51,743 --> 00:32:52,587
Is that so?

475
00:32:52,876 --> 00:32:53,649
Yes

476
00:33:01,672 --> 00:33:07,313
But If the house that Kakiuchi and the others were living in had been a Super Ace dormitory for a long time...

477
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:10,985
Do they have anything to do with Super Ace?

478
00:33:11,305 --> 00:33:13,829
That's right.
So I asked where they were moving

479
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,407
But they don't know at all

480
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,140
Kakiuchi is dead

481
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,829
I have to pursue Junko Hamanaka

482
00:33:23,118 --> 00:33:25,571
Now we need to investigate Super Ace

483
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,618
But Your paid vacation is over today

484
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:33,797
Yes

485
00:33:35,797 --> 00:33:37,797
I'll call the manager and ask him to extend

486
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,758
Hello? this is Nagasawa speaking

487
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:46,774
Oh you?
What can I do for you?

488
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,532
What?
Extension of vacation?

489
00:33:50,344 --> 00:33:51,610
I can't

490
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:55,610
Fake label news is gone

491
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:59,297
If you make a fuss, the world will misunderstand us.

492
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:01,985
What?
That's not good

493
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:06,594
Anyway I don't approve, so come to work tomorrow.

494
00:34:07,055 --> 00:34:07,469
You understand?

495
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:08,985
I get it

496
00:34:10,501 --> 00:34:13,055
Shit! He said I need to go back to work tomorrow

497
00:34:15,407 --> 00:34:17,883
I'll just ignore it.

498
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:21,063
I think you'd better to back

499
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:24,805
But I can't go back to Tokyo without results.

500
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:29,360
It's frustrating to see Mr. Ide die in vain because of the Director.

501
00:34:29,962 --> 00:34:30,977
I can't forgive him

502
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:34,047
I know how you feel but

503
00:34:35,618 --> 00:34:38,274
I think you should go back to work once

504
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,266
You can come again

505
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:47,758
I'll do what I can until then.

506
00:34:49,602 --> 00:34:52,454
My dad will help me if I ask

507
00:34:55,602 --> 00:34:56,829
So please

508
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,547
Please return by night train tonight

509
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:04,626
I see

510
00:35:05,563 --> 00:35:07,759
In that case, I will follow you

511
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,235
I'll let you know as soon as my dad comes back and finds out something

512
00:35:16,915 --> 00:35:19,126
Thanks.
You take care of me a lot

513
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:20,930
Not at all

514
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:48,415
Sugino-san

515
00:35:49,727 --> 00:35:54,376
According to the section chief, there are a lot of fake labels on the market.

516
00:35:54,516 --> 00:35:57,040
Really?
Why you didn't tell me earlier?

517
00:35:58,993 --> 00:36:04,032
If the section chief asks you to go to Osaka to investigate, it's not good for his reputation.

518
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:08,173
Hello? Yes he is here

519
00:36:09,829 --> 00:36:11,180
Hello? This is Sugino

520
00:36:12,454 --> 00:36:13,907
Oh Yukiko-san

521
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,423
What happened after that

522
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:18,251
What? In Tokyo? When?

523
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,102
I see. Where are you now?

524
00:36:22,259 --> 00:36:22,962
At reception desk?

525
00:36:23,696 --> 00:36:26,297
Take the elevator to the rooftop

526
00:36:27,524 --> 00:36:27,945
Yes

527
00:36:38,399 --> 00:36:41,149
Then hasn't your father contacted you since then?

528
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,290
It's been over half a month

529
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,430
My dad might have been in a car accident

530
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:52,868
If so, the police will contact you

531
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:58,540
So you said in the phone you are here for work

532
00:36:58,845 --> 00:37:01,493
Yes I've started to work at Super Ace

533
00:37:02,009 --> 00:37:02,923
Super Ace?

534
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:05,001
Why?

535
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:09,485
About 10 days ago, the president of Super Ace visited my father in sudden

536
00:37:10,649 --> 00:37:12,454
He wanted my father to be a management consultant

537
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:15,126
I explained the situation to him

538
00:37:15,735 --> 00:37:20,743
He was worried about my money and introduced me to a job

539
00:37:23,735 --> 00:37:24,626
That's strange

540
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:26,962
The Super Ace is in Osaka,right?

541
00:37:27,305 --> 00:37:30,759
Yes, but But recently there are many chain stores

542
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,368
The first branch office in Kawasaki was opened in Kanto

543
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:37,657
So yesterday I went on a business trip to Tokyo with the president

544
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:43,196
I was surprised that you worked for Super Ace

545
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,673
I'm sure you were surprised

546
00:37:46,509 --> 00:37:48,352
This arrived a week ago

547
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:51,259
This is a copy of the family register

548
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,485
Yes.My dad ordered both

549
00:37:59,102 --> 00:38:00,368
This is Akio Kakiuchi's, isn't it?

550
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:02,274
Yes, and moreover

551
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:07,766
Another one,Ryuichi Terazawa's is the president of Super Ace

552
00:38:13,868 --> 00:38:19,774
See?
Heitaro Terasawa is the same father of Super Ace and Kakiuchi.

553
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,141
In doing so,Kakiuchi and President Terasawa are half-brothers.

554
00:38:28,704 --> 00:38:33,134
Yes, so I have decided to work at Super Ace

555
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:37,423
I see...

556
00:38:38,087 --> 00:38:38,907
Sugino-san!

557
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:46,360
What can I do for you?

558
00:38:47,251 --> 00:38:50,282
Well..Actually, as you may know

559
00:38:50,923 --> 00:38:55,915
Lately there are a lot of fake labels on the market.

560
00:38:57,102 --> 00:38:59,282
We are in a situation that cannot be ignored

561
00:39:00,368 --> 00:39:05,532
So we decided to take a closer look at it.

562
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:10,415
But The director said he would leave everything to the police

563
00:39:11,227 --> 00:39:12,110
Yes

564
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:15,384
The fake labels have been found nationwide

565
00:39:16,118 --> 00:39:18,532
The police seem to be out of control

566
00:39:19,509 --> 00:39:26,595
Even at the board meeting, we decided that we absolutely have to find the criminal because this is related to the credit of the company.

567
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:30,876
We want you to take the lead in the operation

568
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,891
We understand your situation

569
00:39:34,782 --> 00:39:37,930
But you are one of the our member

570
00:39:38,805 --> 00:39:41,376
You can't oppose the company's decision

571
00:39:43,626 --> 00:39:47,766
I get it.
I also intended to investigate the criminal

572
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,040
But I want to say one thing

573
00:39:53,188 --> 00:39:57,423
If the real culprit is found, will you admit that Mr. Ide was killed in the line of duty?

574
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:59,555
Yes sure, of course

575
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,102
I see. I am going to Osaka tonight

576
00:40:04,696 --> 00:40:08,477
If you need travel expenses, please tell the accounting

577
00:40:31,602 --> 00:40:34,407
I'll take your word for it. I'll go home first.

578
00:40:35,188 --> 00:40:35,961
Thank you for your work

579
00:40:36,508 --> 00:40:38,328
Have a look around Tokyo.

580
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:40,985
I'm sorry I couldn't guide you

581
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,454
Not at all.
I like to go alone

582
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:44,946
Excuse me

583
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,563
What's wrong?

584
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,860
Well..I forgot something

585
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,188
I see

586
00:42:13,766 --> 00:42:14,954
What did you forget?

587
00:42:31,665 --> 00:42:35,250
I see.
You think he's Kakiuchi

588
00:42:35,829 --> 00:42:41,266
Yes.But he should be dead and he shouldn't come to the store

589
00:42:43,086 --> 00:42:43,625
Well...

590
00:42:45,227 --> 00:42:47,367
Maybe he's not dead.

591
00:42:49,032 --> 00:42:51,047
Then that corpse?

592
00:42:54,399 --> 00:42:56,211
Oh it's time to go

593
00:42:56,547 --> 00:42:57,446
Yes

594
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,243
Yukikosan,
Actually, today I did some research on President Terasawa of Super Ace.

595
00:43:04,321 --> 00:43:08,407
He invests more and more in the companies he's interested in and gets the rights.

596
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:11,547
And he always controls the company from then on.

597
00:43:12,797 --> 00:43:14,602
So..by any chance

598
00:43:15,618 --> 00:43:19,164
I think he has the registration papers for Fujigane Shokai and Mitsuya Shoji.

599
00:43:19,664 --> 00:43:20,727
Do you know that?

600
00:43:21,688 --> 00:43:24,618
Yes...if I try to research

601
00:43:25,758 --> 00:43:27,375
Really? Can you do that?

602
00:43:27,899 --> 00:43:30,922
Well...I can't reply clearly

603
00:43:31,954 --> 00:43:34,414
He always has a bag with important documents

604
00:43:35,961 --> 00:43:37,547
Maybe it's in there.

605
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:41,797
If the registration book is in that bag.

606
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:44,821
I'll find who I'm looking for.

607
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:52,274
We can find out who embezzled your company's money and set your company on fire.

608
00:43:53,586 --> 00:43:55,782
Then, I will try to research

609
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:59,914
If you are found, you are in trouble.

610
00:44:00,609 --> 00:44:01,336
Don't worry

611
00:44:02,586 --> 00:44:03,868
I worry about my father

612
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:08,719
Maybe my dad is in captivity in Super Ace

613
00:44:09,883 --> 00:44:11,133
You think too much

614
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,532
Anyway, please research

615
00:44:14,383 --> 00:44:16,063
I will contact you as soon as I get to Osaka

616
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:18,360
Do not do overdo

617
00:44:18,461 --> 00:44:18,946
Yes

618
00:44:34,914 --> 00:44:35,993
Well.. what is this?

619
00:44:37,196 --> 00:44:38,602
This is in the possession of Akio Kakiuchi.

620
00:44:39,289 --> 00:44:40,071
Kakiuchi's?

621
00:44:42,618 --> 00:44:43,735
He had dentures?

622
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:47,821
It seems so.
His mother saw this and said it must be him.

623
00:44:49,008 --> 00:44:51,797
I think this is not true.
He is still alive

624
00:44:54,243 --> 00:44:55,235
Person who dead was...

625
00:44:55,993 --> 00:45:01,516
12345678

626
00:45:04,696 --> 00:45:05,969
I'm tired

627
00:45:06,524 --> 00:45:07,227
Let me have a break

628
00:45:16,407 --> 00:45:17,446
Are you Junko Hamanaka?

629
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:19,188
Well.. Yes...

630
00:45:20,391 --> 00:45:21,844
I think I have met you before

631
00:45:22,633 --> 00:45:25,422
The age of dead Kakiuchi is 32 years old

632
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:26,493
Yes

633
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,851
He was young, but he had dentures?

634
00:45:31,406 --> 00:45:32,640
So what?

635
00:45:36,702 --> 00:45:38,406
Where are the bones of kakiuchi?

636
00:45:38,984 --> 00:45:39,671
I buried it.

637
00:45:40,788 --> 00:45:41,312
To where?

638
00:45:41,795 --> 00:45:42,827
Why do you want to know?

639
00:45:43,007 --> 00:45:43,570
I need to know

640
00:45:44,398 --> 00:45:45,507
Where did you bury his bones?

641
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:48,859
You insist!
Do you think I'm sleeping hugging his bones?

642
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:51,796
You!
You didn't bury his bone, right?

643
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:54,773
I can't take this anymore!
I said I burred it

644
00:45:54,976 --> 00:45:55,648
To where?

645
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:57,663
His temple

646
00:45:58,132 --> 00:45:59,585
Teach me again, teacher

647
00:46:00,429 --> 00:46:01,445
Where is the temple?

648
00:46:02,288 --> 00:46:05,023
It's a temple called Genryo-ji in Takatsuki

649
00:46:07,179 --> 00:46:10,343
123456

650
00:46:10,413 --> 00:46:13,062
What's buried there are the bones of a different man.

651
00:46:13,194 --> 00:46:15,452
12345

652
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:23,843
Excuse me

653
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:31,523
Excuse me

654
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:40,046
Who is it?

655
00:46:41,968 --> 00:46:42,320
Oh

656
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,085
I'm here to ask you something

657
00:46:46,421 --> 00:46:49,577
Is Akio Kakiuchi's body buried here?

658
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,343
Yes Because there is a grave of Mr. Kakiuchi's ancestors here

659
00:46:55,671 --> 00:46:57,210
Where is his grave?

660
00:46:57,546 --> 00:46:59,429
Do you want to visit the grave?

661
00:46:59,648 --> 00:46:59,968
Yes

662
00:47:00,343 --> 00:47:01,452
Then I'll take you there

663
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:02,882
Thanks

664
00:47:42,835 --> 00:47:43,546
Here

665
00:47:51,749 --> 00:47:52,992
The burial was really done?

666
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,281
It ’s natural to bury it.

667
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,898
Then show me his urn

668
00:47:59,445 --> 00:48:01,593
His urn?
I can't show you

669
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,093
Can you make a special request?

670
00:48:04,327 --> 00:48:05,101
I can't

671
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,359
I'm murderous

672
00:48:08,351 --> 00:48:11,023
It is alleged that a man was killed instead of Kakiuchi akio

673
00:48:12,202 --> 00:48:14,976
We'll find out when we show the dentist his dentures in the urn.

674
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:19,851
But moving the grave is not easy

675
00:48:23,265 --> 00:48:26,163
I will come again after going through legal procedures

676
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:24,911
Wait!

677
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,294
let me get the path

678
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:35,615
I see, so that guy tried to kill you

679
00:49:36,388 --> 00:49:37,169
I think so

680
00:49:37,927 --> 00:49:40,263
He might be Akio Kakiuchi

681
00:49:40,302 --> 00:49:40,724
Excuse me

682
00:49:40,966 --> 00:49:43,279
Mr. Tago was really killed?

683
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:47,091
I think the police will announce it later

684
00:49:48,224 --> 00:49:51,169
This is a secret, but...

685
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:56,325
Jingo Shoten will soon be replaced by Kokusai Rayon Shoten.

686
00:49:56,802 --> 00:49:58,810
So Let's work together

687
00:49:59,232 --> 00:50:01,833
So did Fujikane get out of our company?

688
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,950
Yes,As a result of the discussion

689
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:05,223
Excuse me

690
00:50:05,248 --> 00:50:07,427
Oh yeah, about that fake label....

691
00:50:07,849 --> 00:50:09,747
I asked Fujikane

692
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,333
It was true

693
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:15,068
When you take shelter, make sure you go under a big tree.

694
00:50:16,756 --> 00:50:18,944
Your company is very reliable

695
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:20,771
See you

696
00:50:42,083 --> 00:50:43,966
What's wrong with you?

697
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:46,638
Nothing

698
00:50:53,747 --> 00:50:56,599
The neon installation work is finished. Would you like to see it?

699
00:50:57,169 --> 00:50:57,583
Yes

700
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,138
Please count

701
00:52:12,122 --> 00:52:13,380
Thank you for your hard work

702
00:52:13,950 --> 00:52:14,497
See you

703
00:53:06,325 --> 00:53:09,490
Will you bring me a cold drink?

704
00:53:09,904 --> 00:53:11,240
I will prepare it soon

705
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:28,661
Oh Yukiko-san.
It's me

706
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,107
I just returned from Osaka and now I'm in front of Kawasaki station

707
00:53:33,505 --> 00:53:36,115
How was the matter in the president's bag?

708
00:53:37,036 --> 00:53:40,747
Well... I tried to find it

709
00:53:41,513 --> 00:53:45,536
Just before... it's not good

710
00:53:46,396 --> 00:53:49,247
Not at all... I see.. thank you

711
00:53:50,513 --> 00:53:53,021
Well.. I hope it works

712
00:53:53,693 --> 00:53:57,857
I see, then you can stop work, I will manage it

713
00:53:58,763 --> 00:53:59,966
What? well...

714
00:54:01,021 --> 00:54:04,310
I'm going to take a chance and talk to Terasawa.

715
00:54:06,193 --> 00:54:08,388
Anyway, You don't have to do that anymore

716
00:54:09,466 --> 00:54:10,856
Did you make sense?
See you

717
00:54:14,544 --> 00:54:16,513
Well..who is it?

718
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,224
My name is Sugino, Research Division, International Rayon Sales Department.

719
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:20,536
Excuse me

720
00:54:24,958 --> 00:54:26,138
You're President Terasawa, right?

721
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,599
Mmm..Um

722
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:35,443
I want to hear about your relationship with Akio Takeuchi

723
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:38,786
I see

724
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:41,661
Take your seat

725
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:53,740
He was a very troubled person

726
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:57,747
He used to be my driver

727
00:54:59,036 --> 00:55:01,490
His driving was very rough

728
00:55:02,458 --> 00:55:05,786
He had a personality that likes dangerous things

729
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,740
He had an unusual personality

730
00:55:09,935 --> 00:55:14,818
It's dangerous to free him so I shared the money and took care of him

731
00:55:17,349 --> 00:55:21,802
I was relieved that he committed suicide

732
00:55:24,740 --> 00:55:26,060
But Terasawa-san

733
00:55:26,927 --> 00:55:28,544
He is alive

734
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:30,240
He is alive?

735
00:55:34,615 --> 00:55:36,857
Do you have any evidence?

736
00:55:37,271 --> 00:55:38,451
Don't pretend you don't know

737
00:55:39,583 --> 00:55:41,005
I know everything

738
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:44,826
He is your half brother

739
00:55:46,802 --> 00:55:50,919
You used him to kill some people

740
00:55:51,029 --> 00:55:52,662
Hey! What are you talking about?

741
00:55:53,537 --> 00:55:54,935
I am a manager

742
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:57,912
I do business but not murder

743
00:55:58,349 --> 00:55:59,880
Don't pretend you don't know

744
00:56:02,513 --> 00:56:02,974
Ok

745
00:56:03,779 --> 00:56:05,294
I'm ready for this.

746
00:56:05,755 --> 00:56:08,310
You can do whatever you want

747
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:13,990
I am very busy with the management plan of the company

748
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:24,763
He's leaving. he doesn't want any tea.

749
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:29,998
I will visit you again

750
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:32,748
Next time I will talk more with you

751
00:56:34,021 --> 00:56:36,974
I find evidence to prevent you from escaping

752
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:40,748
You will appear in the police

753
00:56:44,107 --> 00:56:45,732
He must be crazy

754
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,107
Oh Tago-san

755
00:57:04,935 --> 00:57:08,404
I am planning to go to the villa of Lake Yamanaka today

756
00:57:09,287 --> 00:57:11,458
Can you accompany with me?

757
00:57:11,748 --> 00:57:12,216
What?

758
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:19,013
I want to organize my documents before I go back to Osaka

759
00:57:20,919 --> 00:57:22,021
Is that bad for you?

760
00:57:22,529 --> 00:57:23,232
No

761
00:57:23,912 --> 00:57:25,279
I will go with you

762
00:57:27,490 --> 00:57:29,380
It will help me a lot

763
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:08,782
Please come in

764
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:09,509
Thank you

765
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:59,383
Tago-kun

766
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:03,711
Can you cook something for me from the food bag?

767
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:05,164
Kitchen is there

768
00:59:05,445 --> 00:59:06,055
Yes

769
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,855
Well, I'm sorry but can you prepare bath for me?

770
00:59:34,268 --> 00:59:34,447
Yes

771
00:59:34,472 --> 00:59:35,785
bathroom is there

772
00:59:36,277 --> 00:59:36,785
Yes

773
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:07,363
Hey you!

774
01:00:08,379 --> 01:00:09,246
Can I borrow your car?

775
01:00:09,574 --> 01:00:09,925
What?

776
01:00:10,183 --> 01:00:10,800
I'm in hurry

777
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:11,769
What's wrong with you?

778
01:00:11,794 --> 01:00:13,175
I will tell you why

779
01:00:31,824 --> 01:00:33,918
Your bath is ready now

780
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:35,761
I see.
Thank you

781
01:03:51,273 --> 01:03:54,374
Well...you finally show who you are

782
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:06,702
Sugino let you do this, right?

783
01:04:12,898 --> 01:04:14,366
Never mind

784
01:04:15,437 --> 01:04:18,304
Sugino will be here soon

785
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:19,726
He will come?

786
01:04:20,304 --> 01:04:20,999
Why?

787
01:04:21,976 --> 01:04:25,319
I told him to come if I wanted to help you

788
01:04:26,194 --> 01:04:29,053
I don't know what is on your mind but

789
01:04:29,741 --> 01:04:33,631
I hired you intentionally

790
01:04:36,812 --> 01:04:40,913
I wanted to know how much you know

791
01:04:43,663 --> 01:04:49,812
I know you heard from your dad about my name

792
01:04:50,812 --> 01:04:53,585
So.. that is you as I thought

793
01:04:54,343 --> 01:04:55,859
You were the one my dad hated

794
01:04:56,702 --> 01:04:57,671
Where is my dad

795
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,062
He is dead

796
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:03,085
Your father was no match for me... until the end.

797
01:05:04,999 --> 01:05:08,085
There is a loser on the business

798
01:05:08,702 --> 01:05:10,624
It's law of the jungle

799
01:05:11,365 --> 01:05:14,507
Humanity doesn't matter to succeed in business

800
01:05:15,124 --> 01:05:18,092
In that sense your father was a loser

801
01:05:21,053 --> 01:05:21,889
And...

802
01:05:22,983 --> 01:05:27,046
Sugino and you will be dead soon

803
01:05:35,569 --> 01:05:38,999
You are a distraction.
Anyone who gets in my way will die.

804
01:05:42,046 --> 01:05:46,100
We Super Ace are at the top of the industry

805
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:49,233
Our company is at the top of the industry

806
01:05:50,069 --> 01:05:54,584
Because we used counterfeit international rayon labels

807
01:05:57,803 --> 01:05:58,624
chocolate

808
01:05:58,975 --> 01:05:59,928
caramel

809
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:02,225
canning,detergent

810
01:06:02,546 --> 01:06:03,936
Something like that

811
01:06:05,038 --> 01:06:07,491
If other stores lower their prices, we'll lower ours even more.

812
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:10,288
If they cut 3 yen, our store will cut 5 yen

813
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,686
This price competition almost destroyed other stores

814
01:06:16,483 --> 01:06:21,225
Our company has made a lot of profits thanks to counterfeit labels

815
01:06:22,522 --> 01:06:28,029
Super Ace now has many branches all over Japan

816
01:06:28,749 --> 01:06:31,655
Our company has grown into a large company with 2 billion assets

817
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:38,694
Our company never went bankrupt soon

818
01:06:40,335 --> 01:06:40,967
Does it make sense?

819
01:06:41,959 --> 01:06:43,623
So you guys are in the way

820
01:06:45,499 --> 01:06:49,530
I'm in trouble if a counterfeit label is found

821
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,004
Will I use that car again?

822
01:08:34,910 --> 01:08:37,301
Sugino will come here soon

823
01:08:37,574 --> 01:08:39,152
I'm worried because you always use the same method

824
01:08:40,316 --> 01:08:41,793
Where to put their corpses?

825
01:08:42,402 --> 01:08:45,496
If they die, bring them here

826
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:48,637
They would have been forced into a vacant house

827
01:08:50,269 --> 01:08:54,074
I lost my family register instead of Tago

828
01:08:55,012 --> 01:08:58,582
So you should play with Junko for a while

829
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:02,082
I don't know how serious you are

830
01:09:02,293 --> 01:09:02,989
What the fuck

831
01:09:03,777 --> 01:09:06,313
I will process your passport immediately

832
01:09:06,753 --> 01:09:09,395
I want to go to Hong Kong.
That's cool

833
01:09:18,834 --> 01:09:19,459
Junko!

834
01:09:24,090 --> 01:09:25,041
Damn it!

835
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:27,833
You poisoned her whiskey

836
01:09:28,451 --> 01:09:30,872
You would have killed me after I kill someone

837
01:09:31,249 --> 01:09:32,513
You idiot!
What are you talking about?

838
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:41,391
Ok, then drink this?

839
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:17,996
You worked on ice

840
01:10:24,061 --> 01:10:24,743
Damn it!

841
01:10:24,935 --> 01:10:26,803
Can you kill me?

842
01:10:27,541 --> 01:10:32,058
You don't have a family register, you can't live if you kill me

843
01:10:32,833 --> 01:10:35,240
You have been crazy since you were born

844
01:10:35,922 --> 01:10:36,945
Ahhh!

845
01:10:46,952 --> 01:10:48,060
Now your turn

846
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:50,659
Come on!

847
01:10:51,490 --> 01:10:53,387
You know us too much!
Come!

848
01:11:23,699 --> 01:11:25,816
Be patient until the exhaust gas is full in this

849
01:11:27,073 --> 01:11:31,348
Your father put up with Fujigane's Shoji for more than 30 minutes

850
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:02,577
Yukiko-san!

851
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:50,771
Stop!

852
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:52,646
Stop!

853
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,249
Damn it!

854
01:16:22,970 --> 01:16:23,779
Yukiko-san!

855
01:16:26,918 --> 01:16:27,636
Oh..

856
01:16:31,946 --> 01:16:32,763
Yukiko-san!

857
01:16:33,438 --> 01:16:34,191
Yukiko-san!

858
01:16:55,853 --> 01:16:56,457
Ah!!

859
01:17:07,397 --> 01:17:08,590
Kakiuchi was dead

860
01:17:10,984 --> 01:17:13,519
My car hit his car.
His car fell off a cliff

861
01:17:14,549 --> 01:17:16,090
A fire ignited his car and exploded

862
01:17:18,313 --> 01:17:19,364
It was so scary

863
01:17:21,374 --> 01:17:23,207
But.. it's all over

864
01:17:29,158 --> 01:17:29,961
Yukiko-san

865
01:17:31,183 --> 01:17:32,965
I didn't tell you this

866
01:17:35,771 --> 01:17:38,079
Your father was killed instead of Kakiuchi

867
01:17:40,877 --> 01:17:41,495
I know it

868
01:17:43,498 --> 01:17:45,202
I was wondering if maybe...

869
01:17:46,247 --> 01:17:48,626
Terazawa told me yesterday at the villa

870
01:17:54,918 --> 01:17:57,816
I don't know how I can comfort you

871
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:01,630
Don't worry

872
01:18:03,285 --> 01:18:06,360
Father died in the fire like mother and brother

873
01:18:08,619 --> 01:18:10,330
I think my father hoped so

874
01:18:12,695 --> 01:18:16,161
I want to put my father's bones near my mother

875
01:18:21,268 --> 01:18:22,553
Will you go with me?

876
01:18:24,748 --> 01:18:25,600
Of course

877
01:18:27,852 --> 01:18:28,462
And

878
01:18:29,826 --> 01:18:32,326
I will be with you from now

879
01:18:33,697 --> 01:18:34,144
Oh...

880
01:19:00,669 --> 01:19:09,354
Finish

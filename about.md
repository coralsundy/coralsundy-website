### Who Am I
Hi, I am John, I have an online alias __Coralsundy__, and welcome to my personal home page / website.

This site is mainly made for my personal projects and hobbies, hope you can find them entertaining as much as I do.

### What Projects or Hobbies Do You Have?
* __[Strike In Narrow Path (SINP) 2010-2014](https://sites.google.com/site/strikeinnarrowpath/)__: I am the project lead, main programmer, level designer, and beta tester for C5 Studios - a multi-national game studio that consist of 3 members, working on an expansion pack / modification for an old video game called [Commandos: Behind Enemy Lines (BEL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commandos:_Behind_Enemy_Lines). The game was initially developed by Pyro Studios and published by Eidos Interactive in 1998. Over the years, the game has a small but dedicated modding community, but never have an organized effort to create high quality mission packs. I got inspired to start a full-size expansion pack project for BEL after playing [T2X](https://www.thief2x.com/), a 13-mission fan expansion for [Thief 2: The Metal Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thief_II). In over 4 years, we were able to make 9 new missions featuring new maps, new mechanics, new weapons, new enemies, new setups, and new stories. It was initially designed to be a full 20-mission expansion just like the original game, but the development halted after different opinons among dev members on the direction of the project. As a result, the project was never completed as planned, but the quality of the product still holds up until now.

* __[Movie Subtitles](https://subhd.tv/u/coralsundy):__ I have a hobby of collecting and watching Japanese old movies, ranging from 1920s to 2000s. Many of the rare films do not have subtitles, or very lackluster translation, which caused many issues for me while watching. I started to proofread the subtitles and correct/improve their qualities based on my own experience in translation/language (I have worked as a translator for a few video game fan patches). I also workied (and still am actively working) with native Japanese speakers to create subtitles for rare old Japanese movies, either in Chinese or in English, and share these translated subtitles online for free. My goal is to not only allow more people to watch and understand the beauty of these old movies, but also to preserve the history. So that these movies will not be forgotten because there were no translations. (Note: I will also re-upload the subtitles in other host, as the website I linked is in Chinese and not easy to navigate for Western audiences)

* __Movie Reviews:__ I like to think and write about the movies I watched in the past years, specifically in Japanese old movies as I mentioned above. The reviews will only focus on the movie itself, based on the time the movie was made, and discuss actors/directors/script writers/composers related topics. It is just a piece of the opinion, so if you want to check whether it is a movie for you, you should purchase a copy to start with. :smiley:
